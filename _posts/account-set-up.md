## Create Account
First thing’s first, you’re going to need a GitHub account.

Go to: https://github.com/

Create a username, add your email address and create a password. After authenticating that you’re a human it will ask you to select a plan, choose the free option. 
It will then give you the option to let GitHub get to know you a bit better with some questions You can just scroll to the bottom of the page and click “Skip this step”.

Check your email – you should have an email from GitHub asking you to verify your email address. Go ahead and do this, which will then open a browser tab that should signal you have authenticated your email and ask you to create your first “repository”. 

Unless you want to learn a bit more about GitHub and do anything fancier for your own work, you won’t really need an initial repository, but go ahead and create one:
* Give your repository a name (you can just call it “test” or “my-repository”)
* Select “Private” 
* Click “Create repository” at the bottom.
This will open a page up that shows a whole load of stuff you won’t need to worry about. If you wanted to learn a bit more about Git and GitHub, there should be a prompt to “Read the guide”, but we’ll cover everything you should need to know here – you don’t need to overwhelm yourself with all the coding stuff in order to help with our Cambridge Digital Library transcription project.
