# Cambridge Digital Library
## Alone in a crowd; transcribing together

A crowd-sourcing project by Cambridge Digital Library, undertaken during the University of Cambridge's closure period due to the Coronavirus outbreak in 2020.

Information and instructions on taking part are published on the web: 
https://cambridge-digital-library.github.io/Crowdsourcing/

The instructions can also be downloaded as a [Word](https://github.com/Cambridge-Digital-Library/Crowdsourcing/blob/master/CUDL-CrowdTranscription-Manual.docx) or [PDF](https://github.com/Cambridge-Digital-Library/Crowdsourcing/blob/master/CUDL-CrowdTranscription-Manual.pdf) file.

Once a transcription file is complete, we incorporate it into the metadata file of the item. As well as being indexed by our search engine, the transcription of each page will then display adjacent to the digitised image when a user selects to view the transcription tab. The metadata files in Cambridge Digital Library are also downloadable from the site under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY-NC creative commons licence</a>.
