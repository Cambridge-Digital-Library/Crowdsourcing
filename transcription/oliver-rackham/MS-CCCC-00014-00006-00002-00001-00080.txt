Armillaria appears to be
the fungus which grows at
the base of the big lime tree
in the back grounds of
Christchurch Mansion. The
tree is some 10ft high,
5ft thick at the base,
and several large bran-
ches have been removed 
from the base, though there
is as yet no visible decay
from their stumps. The 
top of the tree is showing
signs of white-rot and 
die-back The toadstools
extend about 5ft up the 
trunk, in a shallow bay.

in St Margaret's churchyard, Ips-

[6432-6433]

Tricholoma nudum. One in the 
belt along the Mare Way, be-
tween Harlton and Barrington. 
In this belt are several 
fresh rabbit holes, and a live 
rabbit was seen.
The W. part of the belt is 
for the most part fairly open,
with less undergrowth than in 
other woods on this ridge. There
are several beech trees, mostly
quite small but very decayed,

[6434-6435]
and having a planted look. 
In places the wood takes on 
a chalky appearance. No
Daphne was seen except in the
pan-handle.

ice is comparatively thin and 
very cracked, and moved in alar-
ming waves when skates passed.

The ditch between King's and
Queens' Piece, and the model-yacht
pond, were also used by skates.
There is not much ice 
on the river, apart from a very 
thin but continuous sheet
across the whole width between 
Fen Causeway and the bathing 
place, and another across one
arm at Laudress Green. The
narrow arm at Crusoe's Island 
is more thickly frozen. The ice
is quite thick on the diagonal 
stream across Sheep's Green.

of about 1 1/2 in. of sow (ex-
