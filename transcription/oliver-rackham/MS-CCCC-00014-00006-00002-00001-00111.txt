Hayley Wood.
The 1966 plot is nearly 
half submerged.  The others
are conspicuously drier, 
although the Long Hollow
is full.
The Lepidozia on the
big stump in the 1966 plot
is noticeably healthier than
it has been.
Some oxlip leaves are
still green.
The pond is right up
to the level of the grip
of the N.W. ride - it has
submerged the base of the
triple oak.

Brandon Park.  To collect
material for the Part I class.
Peltigera canina and
polydactyla are about equally
abundant, P. poly-dctyla
especially in a small block
of recently-planted heathland 
in which the tree canopy
is not yet classed.  The
two species are difficult
to distinguish when growing
in grass, as P. polydctyla
is often as large and as
flat as P. caninba and 
may develop a scurf closely
[8564-8565]
resembling the tomentum
of P. canina.
For further lichens see p.
8527.

hill of shallow calcareous
soils surrounded by deeper
more acid sands.  On the 
hill, Silene Otites is remark-
ably abundant and flower-
ing more vigorously (even
at this time of year) than
I have seen it anywhere
on the breck.  Soleranthus
perennis is also very abundant.

hollows, the 1967 plot has
none of the waterlogging so
characteristicof the previous
one.
A violet is flowering vig-
orously in the ride by the
a rotten poplar log in the
1966 plot.
The stool ashes in the
S.W. part of the 1967 plot
[8570 - 8571]
are very large indeed and
in many cases have divi-
ded themselves up with
time into several isolated
fragments.
The 1967 plot is a wetter
type of vegetation than the
1966 plot.  It is very short
of oaks (including, how-
ever, some dead ones).  There
are many poplars, none
of any large size;  some
are dead, though not recently.

Elmn wood and scrub.
The elms round the periphery
are either planted as belts
or result from strips left
[8574-8575]
[DIAG]
from an ancient felling.
They are U. carpinifolia agg.
with strong corky flanges on
the suckers.
The parish boundary 
bank and the boundary 
bank of the old drift are
visible in the elm belts.
A patch of dense elm
scrub has invaded the drift-
way in front of the original
boundary bank.
The plantation is c.10
years old, of mixed hardwood
(incl. oak) under a nurse
of Scots.  The latter have done
badly and are now declining.
The main area of scrup
is very dense, about 10ft
high, of elm wirh a smaller
[8576]
proportion of hawthorn (C. mono-
gyna).

rather unimpressive gault grass-
land with some hawthorn
scrub, though the latter
shows little sign of exten-
ding.
Other plantation.
This consists of three
areas:
(i) Hawthorn scrub about
5ft high.
(ii) New plantation (about
20 years old).  Similar in
species composition to the
old plantation, but with
more birch and less conifers.
