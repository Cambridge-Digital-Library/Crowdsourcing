This is the only place
where Erica arborea was seen.
Growing out of presumably
calcareous rocks and with
all the calcicoles.

July 11.
A Pistacia bush removed
in the excavation was cut
down to the stock c. 15 years
ago. The stock is charred by
an old fire.

often occur in former arable.

Pine Wood on N. side of
Hill 122.
Pines c. 40% cover. Uneeven-
-aged stand of very small to
medium trees. Seldom more
than c. 15 ft high probably
because of wind pruning.
Understorey resembles
Type I but has patches
like Type II.

Type I).

965
The boundaries of this
wood are quite sharp, espe-
cially at the top of the hill.
On both the N.W. and N.E.
slopes it is somewhat irregular
and there are tracts of scrub
without pines, for no evident
reason.
The valley running into the
N. part of the hills from the 
W. has a complex system of 
tiny terraced fields.

[10966-10967]

A very strong N.E. wind
blew today. Very warm
and coming in squalls lasting
c. 1/4 hour, with hills between.
During squalls on Fornon
Chorti it was difficult to
stand and one was blusted
by sound blown from the
spoil-heaps.

On the E. of Hill 122 is a
Gypsum outcrop ([SYMBOL] 22). Like that
by the plain (p. 915) it is
surrounded by ϰονσϰονϱαs and
distinguishable chiefly by its
even sparser vegetation. The
mineral is glassy and crystal-
line and not noticeably eroded.
