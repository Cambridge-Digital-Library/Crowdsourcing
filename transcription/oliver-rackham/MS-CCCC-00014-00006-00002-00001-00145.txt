The boundaries of this
wood are quite sharp, espe-

On both the N.W. and N.E.
slopes it is somewhat irregular
and there are tracts of scrub
without pines, for no evident
reason.
The valley running into the
N. part of the hills from the

July 12. To Heracleion.
Phragmites occurs in 
small quantity mixed with
Arundo at the bridge over
the largest be[????] between
Myrtos & Hierapetra, at
Gralivia Met., grid ref. 639
014.
In the Arumondha[????] re-
gion, in a dry plain by the
roadside, is a small quan-
tity of an Arundo with nar-
rower more erect & distant
leaves, than that com-
monly planted.
The Arundo used in the
Hierapetra plain is seldom
less than 2 cm diam. at the
big end, often to 3 cm. The
lower internodes use often

977
some 40 cm long, the upper
much shorter.
There is a spectacular
very narrow wedge-shaped
gorge running E. into the

Maize is not grown on
the S. coast. Some was seen
by the Mirabello Gulf, but
it appears to suffer from drought.
Bananas are grown on
the coast S. of Aj. ΝίϞ., in
small groves among other trees

Several storks were
seen in the grazing marshes
between Thessalonica & the
Axios Bridge. Three nests
were built in the railway
telegraph poles.
The railway is single
track except between Athens

The weather was gen-
erally cloudless except over
Parnassus where there was
actually a heavy shower.
Very few rivers flow in Greece
except the Aliackenon and
Axios, and these are much
reduced as shown by the
many unoccupied arches 
of their bridges.
Thypha angustifolia

July 14. Vojvodina [SYMBOL] Munich.
The part of the Vojvodina
traversed by train has 
very few woods. Mainly fields
filled in strips & not divided
by any fences or baulks.
Villages frequent, usually
large, of mainly 1-storey
houses along wide straight
streets with small gardens
between the houses. Construc-
tion usually brick [????] brick in
a timber frame.
There are small tracts
of steppe grazing with very
short thin grass. Grazed by
flocks of sheep under a shep-
herd or two who live in
a hut or shelter by the well.

997
[SYMBOL]11
The wells (as well as a few

splayed at the bottom.

There is now no sign
of the great floods in Vater-
drautral & Mölltal, except
small areas of gravel in
some of the worst affected

July 19. Watlington, Oxon
(Part II excursion).
The walls of Woburn
Park are of brick with "mono-
lithic" buttresses of cast-iron
shaped to look like brick but
betrayed by their [????]t.
No gale damage was 
noticed on the journey beyond
the Cambs border.
The woods around
Watlington Park are still 
mainly beech.

[11004-11005]

Chalk Grassland, Watlington.
Very similar for the
most part to that on
Bulpit Hill. A thin & patchy
turg with large areas devoid
of grass. Many annuals,
e.g. Blackstonia, Gentiana,
amarella.
Hawthorns are frequent
but seldom get beyond
3 ft high (see later).
The grassland areas
are bounded by straight
edges from deeper turf
and are probably the
result of wartime cultivation.

Circium acaule is very
abundant and may be

1005
dominant over small areas
of grassland. It has a short
creep rhizome and can be
dated by the successive
scars of old rosettes.
Gentiana has a moder-
ately bitter taste.

Rabbits are quits active
at Watlington, mainly in the
chalk heath with its deeper
soil. Numerous burrows.
Many scrapes (which appear
to be used more than
once).

[11006-11007]
1006
Chalk Heath, Watlington.
A small and complex
area with 3 main vegetation 
types:
1. Apparently even-aged often 
chlorotic dense gorse.
2. Hawthorn scrub.
3. Grassland with calcicoles
& calcifuges.
The three types appear
not to be succeeding at 
present. Most of the large
hawthorns appear to be
ancient. Among the grass0
land are many small hawthorns
but even where the rabbits
have left them these do not
put on more than a few in
a year.

1007
Heather is scarce at 
the boundaries between 2
& 3. Bushes up to c. 18 in.
high and apparently vigor-
ous.
There is some invasion
of the hawthorn by birch
but other trees do not seem
to be encroaching despite
the nearness of yew.
The grassland is full of
mole-hills, ant-hills, and
rabbit scrapes in various
stages of decay. The flora
of these was one of the
objects of study. Some spp
e.g. Thymus and Iberis
are largely confined to one
of these habitats. [SYMBOL] 13

Millbrook Wood, Beds.
A missed oak wood with
apparently no coppice.

In the Millbrook-Ridgemont
area, on Greensand, most of the
hedgerow oaks & elms are
dead at the top and many
have lost big limbs through
die-back.
Breakheart Hill, Money-
-pot Hill, and Blackhafields
Plantation are all middle-
-aged Scots pine.

King's Wood, Heath & Reach, Beds.
Mainly on greens and. A
large & apparently neglected

[11010-11011]
1010
wood. Mainly oak, some scrubby.
Structure not clearly discern-
ible owing to dense roadside
hedge; probably includes small
coppice but not large.

At Hartwell & Stone, near
Aylesbury, there is an outcrop
of Portlandian which is much
used as a building stone.
A somewhat course-grained stone
usually used as big rough
blocks. Ammonites are used 
as decoration.

Watlington Hill.
Soil pit from plateau
near gorse bush. Much
acted upon by moles & ants.

1011
0-15 cm loam with clay
& silt components, good crumb
structure, reddish brown, with
abundant flint & chalk
pebbles, very humidified.
15-20 cm transition to
broken chalk.

One plant of Cirsium
palustre on the plateau.
Frequent on the S. slope.

Yew woods.

Elder 1-2 - year old
seedllings abundant under
yew. Larger saplings absent.
A few big bushes at edge of
wood.

Sanicle R under yew
generally

Sorbus aria few large
pioners trees, mainly marginal.
Sycamore similar

Viola rivin. rare

Fragaria rare

Yew trees probably even-
-aged, c. 6 in. - 1 1/2 ft dia.
Habit varies according to 
spacing. Where spacing is
wide, all the branches are
horizontal or ascending. Where
it is narrow, the middle

1013
branches are erect, but there
is nearly always some trace
of the pioneer habit of the
young tree. Some cutting
of small trees and of 
branches from large trees, but
this is unimportant.
No young yews though
seedlings of this year are
frequent.
Sunflecks cover about
1/4 of the ground during
sunshine. Ground cover
typically <1%.

Marginal plants:
Solanum dulcamara
Arctium minus
Elder (bushes)

[11014-11015]
1014
Sycamore (young trees)
Privet
Rubus sec. Corylifolii

Soil. Black sticky humic
with frequent sand grains.
Many chalk pebbles &
flints. S.E. facing slope c.
15°. Markedly loose & spon-
gy although no recent mole,
ant, or rabbit activity.

Many yews are scattered
among chalk grassland out-
side the wood, but these
are all apparently of the
same age.

Section exposed in an

1015
excavation shows solid
chalk 12 in. down.

Mole [????] & hills very rare
in the wood. Rabbit scrapings 
numerous at one point just
inside.
Picea. A few trees scat-
tered in the wood, perhaps
60 years old.

This yew wood runs
round the S. side of the
ridge and its W. end. There
is an apparently similar
pocket of yew in the next
valley to the N.E. The
yew wooods are on the
slopes of the chalk hill,

[11016-11017]
1016
With grass above & below.
The upper boundary with
grassland is sharp but
irregular, with many out-
lying trees and groups of
trees. Young yews are very
few in the grassland and
perhaps always planted.
This young even-aged
woodland is probably of
artificial origin, through the 
irregularity suggests it may
not have been planted.
The occurrence of a minority
of trees of other spp is
interesting. These spp do not
occur on the hill by them-
selves. No sign of any
surviving hawthorns.

1017
Iberis amara. [SYMBOL] 13
Very abundant on the
disturbed earth of rabbit scrapes,
seldom elsewhere. The 2
outer petals of flowers on the
outside of the coryinb are
much enlarged.
Badly names, the
taste of the leaves being
not much worse than raw
cabbage.

Blackstonia. [SYMBOL] 14
In great abundance is 
short closed turf.

1. Calocybe Georgii. Probably 
this sp. occurs frequently on
chalk heath, usually solidary
