  Cherry is abundant near
the roadside in the area S. of
A.  It occurs chiefly as
poles here and elsewhere
along the roadside.  It has pro-
bably been selected for in
the replanting.
  North of C the W. boun-
dary contains a few oak
semi-pollards ([SYMBOL] 26). There is
also one yew tree c. 3ft
high but many years old.
  The deep notch in this
boundary does not appear to
be continued by any internal
feature.
  The north end is a
flat and probably wet
area, the only site for [????]
4459
in the wood. Said to contain
daffodil.
  The ditch across the
N.W. salient has recently
been severely deepened and
the pond shown on the O.S.
has disappeared.
  Area E ha been dras-
tically planted in rows with
scrub between derived from
the woodland.  It has a
well-marked but overgrown
boundary hedge which is
intact, including many
woodland species.
  At F the N.-S. boundary
ditch is continued by a
ditch in the same line but
very different in character
[14460-14461]
4460
with a large bank on the
E. side.
  There is one fair-sized
pollard oak on the wood
boundary against Burney
Wood. This area is a complex
of wood and field boundaries
with some massive hedges.
  The internal ditch
running through the wood
at this point is nearly
straight, mostly symmetrical,
and recently cleaned out.
It runs into a large rect-
angular pond.
Ride.  HB passes through
similar woodland types to
this ditch. In both, bracken
is locally dense in an area
4461
with little coppice.  There [!!!!]
is a larger area of "semi-
-neutral" woodland dom-
inated by brambles but
with ash coppice (as inb
Somersham Park).  [!!!!]
  A somewhat similar wood-
land type occurs in area I
by the roadside (here modi-
fied by the absence of
large coppice). It is said to
contain foxglove.
        Features.
1.  Very remarkable valley
situation.
2. Massive bank against
road.  Typical wood-bank in
S. part of W. side.  Other
[14462-14463]
4462
boundary earthworks remark-
ably slight.
3. Complex internal earthworks.
4. Fairly wide acidity range:
standard calcareous to
bracken (foxglove may in-
dicate asmall even more
acid patch).
5. Generally very dry except
in valley bottom & north end.
6. Excellent woodland struc-
ture (where surviving) of
two types strongly correlated
with a "roadside cleasring"
earthwork.
7. Trees & shrubs
Oak           Hazel
Ash           U, glabra
Maple         Cherry

Hornbeam      Prunus spin.

Betula verr.  Cratae. mono.
Elder          "      hybrid
Rosa arv.     Castanea
Aspen
Clematis
(18 - a shortish list for so large
a wood)
8. No suckering elm.
9. Cherry highly correlated with
roadside strip; boundary sharply
defined at ditch.
10. Hornbeam highly correlated
with roadside strip; never abundant.
11. Ulmus glabra coppice confined
to area between submarginal
bank and road.
12. Birch all verrucosa.
13. One YEW.
[14464-14465]
4464
14. Bracken area, almost a 
bracken glade.
15. Oxlip & primrose both present,
remarkably rare. Oxlip per-
haps more on the "old wood"
and primrose on the road-
side strip.
16. No Carex pendula.
17. Ancient wodl;abd plants:
(Mercury)
Cratae. hybrid - but oxy. not
        recorded
Oxlip
No ivy
18. Secondary woodland plants:
Cherry
[!!!!]
19. No Euphorbia amygdaloides
or Geum rivale.
20. Probably poor in herbs.
4465
21. Surface probably even, with-
out hollows.
22. Boundary hedge features.
        Interpretation.
  This is a biparochial
wood (the parish boundary 
is probably meant to be the
E.-W. internal ditch) in
which the history of the two
halves has been similar.
1. Originally a much larger 
wood extending up to the 
A14 on the E. (massive road-
side bank, bigger than all
the internal earthworks).  W.
boundary, and perhaos most
of the S. boundsry, of the
[!!!!]Ugley portion survive;
[1111] the N. and W. boundaries
[14466-14467]
4466
of the Rickling part survive
as field hedges if at all.
2. Roadside clearing made,
width irregular (130-220
ft from edge of road).  Wider
in Ugley than Rickling (note
discontinuity at parish boun-
dary).  New wood-bank made,
probably by adapting an ex-
isting watercourse.
3. Much assarting in Rickling
reduces woodland to about 10
acres.  Northern assart amal-
gamated with roadside clearing.
Assarting in Ugley less ex-
tensive.
r4. Whole roadside clearing (which
is so steep as to be difficult
to cultivate) reverts to wood-
land.  This includes parts which
4467
by now abut to the W. upon
assarts (in both Rickling and
Ugley).  The present N. end
is also secondary woodland
(?slightly later, cf cross
hedge at D).
5. Small area of secondary
woodland added by narrow-
ing road.

Stage 4 happened before 
1805 (Ist ed. O.S.) but suf-
ficiently recently for the
differences in woodland struc-
ture and composition to be
very striking.

Road now wooidland       [DIAG]
other secondary woodland [DIAG]
roadside clearing appear
to run on, suggesting that
the original Ugley Wood
continued here as well.

  The absence of ivy in
the secondary woodland is
curious.  It has a greater range
of trees & shrubs than the primary.

[14470-14471]
4470 Burney Wood (p. 4453)
  Appears from its massive
bank to be another fragment
of ancient woodland.  Separ-
ated from Broom Wood by a
definite road.  Many oak
standards survive; tall and
clise-grown. Structure other-
wise lost.

  Rickling Green is a large
area of semi-improved grass-
land.
