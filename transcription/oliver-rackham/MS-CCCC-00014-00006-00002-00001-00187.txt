  Cherry is abundant near
the roadside in the area S. of
A.  It occurs chiefly as
poles here and elsewhere
along the roadside.  It has pro-
bably been selected for in
the replanting.
  North of C the W. boun-
dary contains a few oak
semi-pollards ([SYMBOL] 26). There is
also one yew tree c. 3ft
high but many years old.
  The deep notch in this
boundary does not appear to
be continued by any internal
feature.
  The north end is a
flat and probably wet
area, the only site for [????]
4459
in the wood. Said to contain
daffodil.
  The ditch across the
N.W. salient has recently
been severely deepened and
the pond shown on the O.S.
has disappeared.
  Area E ha been dras-
tically planted in rows with
scrub between derived from
the woodland.  It has a
well-marked but overgrown
boundary hedge which is
intact, including many
woodland species.
  At F the N.-S. boundary
ditch is continued by a
ditch in the same line but
very different in character
[14460-14461]
4460
with a large bank on the
E. side.
  There is one fair-sized
pollard oak on the wood
boundary against Burney
Wood. This area is a complex
of wood and field boundaries
with some massive hedges.
  The internal ditch
running through the wood
at this point is nearly
straight, mostly symmetrical,
and recently cleaned out.
It runs into a large rect-
angular pond.
Ride.  HB passes through
similar woodland types to
this ditch. In both, bracken
is locally dense in an area
4461
with little coppice.  There [!!!!]
is a larger area of "semi-
-neutral" woodland dom-
inated by brambles but
with ash coppice (as inb
Somersham Park).  [!!!!]
  A somewhat similar wood-
land type occurs in area I
by the roadside (here modi-
fied by the absence of
large coppice). It is said to
contain foxglove.
        Features.
1.  Very remarkable valley
situation.
2. Massive bank against
road.  Typical wood-bank in
S. part of W. side.  Other
[14462-14463]
4462
boundary earthworks remark-
ably slight.
3. Complex internal earthworks.
4. Fairly wide acidity range:
standard calcareous to
bracken (foxglove may in-
dicate asmall even more
acid patch).
5. Generally very dry except
in valley bottom & north end.
6. Excellent woodland struc-
ture (where surviving) of
two types strongly correlated
with a "roadside cleasring"
earthwork.
7. Trees & shrubs
Oak           Hazel
Ash           U, glabra
Maple         Cherry

Hornbeam      Prunus spin.

Rosa arv.     Castanea
Aspen
Clematis
(18 - a shortish list for so large
a wood)
8. No suckering elm.
9. Cherry highly correlated with
roadside strip; boundary sharply
defined at ditch.
10. Hornbeam highly correlated
with roadside strip; never abundant.
11. Ulmus glabra coppice confined
to area between submarginal
bank and road.
12. Birch all verrucosa.
13. One YEW.
[14464-14465]
4464
14. Bracken area, almost a 
bracken glade.
15. Oxlip & primrose both present,
remarkably rare. Oxlip per-
haps more on the "old wood"
and primrose on the road-
side strip.
16. No Carex pendula.
17. Ancient wodl;abd plants:
(Mercury)
Cratae. hybrid - but oxy. not
        recorded
Oxlip
No ivy
18. Secondary woodland plants:
Cherry
[!!!!]
19. No Euphorbia amygdaloides
or Geum rivale.
20. Probably poor in herbs.
4465
21. Surface probably even, with-
out hollows.
22. Boundary hedge features.
        Interpretation.
  This is a biparochial
wood (the parish boundary 
is probably meant to be the
E.-W. internal ditch) in
which the history of the two
halves has been similar.
1. Originally a much larger 
wood extending up to the 
A14 on the E. (massive road-
side bank, bigger than all
the internal earthworks).  W.
boundary, and perhaos most
of the S. boundsry, of the
[!!!!]Ugley portion survive;
[1111] the N. and W. boundaries
[14466-14467]
4466
of the Rickling part survive
as field hedges if at all.
2. Roadside clearing made,
width irregular (130-220
ft from edge of road).  Wider
in Ugley than Rickling (note
discontinuity at parish boun-
dary).  New wood-bank made,
probably by adapting an ex-
isting watercourse.
3. Much assarting in Rickling
reduces woodland to about 10
acres.  Northern assart amal-
gamated with roadside clearing.
Assarting in Ugley less ex-
tensive.
r4. Whole roadside clearing (which
is so steep as to be difficult
to cultivate) reverts to wood-
land.  This includes parts which
4467
by now abut to the W. upon
assarts (in both Rickling and
Ugley).  The present N. end
is also secondary woodland
(?slightly later, cf cross
hedge at D).
5. Small area of secondary
woodland added by narrow-
ing road.

Stage 4 happened before 
1805 (Ist ed. O.S.) but suf-
ficiently recently for the
differences in woodland struc-
ture and composition to be
very striking.

roadside clearing appear
to run on, suggesting that
the original Ugley Wood
continued here as well.

  The absence of ivy in
the secondary woodland is
curious.  It has a greater range
of trees & shrubs than the primary.

[14470-14471]
4470 Burney Wood (p. 4453)
  Appears from its massive
bank to be another fragment
of ancient woodland.  Separ-
ated from Broom Wood by a
definite road.  Many oak
standards survive; tall and
clise-grown. Structure other-
wise lost.

  Rickling Green is a large
area of semi-improved grass-
land.

Curious oak (p. 4496-7)
  Tree with a low fork
below which is a pronounced
flange on each side of the
trunk.  One of these has
a slight lengthwise crack.  No
slime flux.  Looks very like
wet-wood but might be the
result of mechanical weakness.
Plantation (p. 4500 &c.).
Mixed conifewrs c. 1966.  Wet
site.  Regrowth of coppice vigor-
ous (especially below), but pro-
4511
bably does not interfere seriously
with conifers.

      Woodland Types.
1. Mixed coppice with srandards
without hornbeam.  Usual
"heavy" type.
2.  Hornbeam coppice with oak
standards.  Northern & southern lobe. Tran-
sition to 1 usually gradual.
Traces of 1 persist in 2 in
the form of ash and other
stools, often large, commonly
dead, especially after recent
cutting, which suggests that
the very high proportion of
hornbeam is due to recent
management & neglect of the
coppice.
[14512-14513]
4512
3. Hornbeam coppice without
oak.  Trnsition more abrupt,
except to the N.W. where
there may be an area
resembling 1.  Oaks rare and
usually apparently quite recent
(?in former bracken glades).
Ground vegetstion very sparse
(unlike 2) and suggests former
bracken & bluebells.  Stools
denser than in 2, poles lower
(c. 25 ft) and more spreading.
4. hornbeam-sallow (p. 4508).
Very local, perhaps a wet
variant of 3.
5. Suckering elm.
6. Birch.
Type 3 is probably calci-
fuge on well-drained gravel,
4513
but the other types are probably
relatively independent of pH, and
drainage.  No evidence associ-
ating hornbeam with secon-
dary woodland.

         Features.
1. Hill-top site.
2. Mainly calcareous clay, but
with considerable acid areas,
probably due to gravel caps.
3. Wide range of drainage.
There is a particularly wet
area at the southern of
the 3 cross-roads, close
to the dry S.W. gravel.
4. Present wood-bank rather
uniform sinuous to nearly straight,
generally strong to
very strong.  Wood-bank of
[14514-14515]
4514
the S. lobe weak or absent.
5. Excellent roadside clearing,
with three successive banks.
The present clearing is much
narrower than that of Broom
Wood but that defined by
the weak inner bank would
be considerably wider.
6. Wood-banks (marginal
& submarginal) run through
gravel in the S.W. and are
well preserved.
7. Numerous pits, mainly in
possible secondary woodland.
8. Surface generally quite flat.
9. 30 trees & shrubs (p. 4473).
10. Excellent woodland struc-
ture.  Some recent coppice-like acti-
vity (widening N. part of main
4585
ride and N.E. cross ride). Giant stools.
11. Hornbeam in several dif-
ferent relations to other trees
& woodland types.
12. Hornbeam-sallow unique.
13. Ground flora zonation very
similr ro that at Haykey
(though interrupted by acid
areas) and similarly relates
to waterlogging. Remarkably little mercury.
14. Cherry present, but only
in S. "handle".
15. HELLEBORE in primary
woodland but associated with
an artificial pond.
16. DAFFODIL under mixed
coppice with hornbeam, on fairly
dry pits in probable secondary
woodland (cf Broom Wood).
[14516-14517]
4516
17. Elm invasion present but
moderate.
18. Birch mainly pubesecens
(contrast to Broom Wood).
19. Oxlip & primrose present
Oxlip majority.  Primrose
has a strong tendency to mar-
gins, acid areas, and 2ndary
woodland.
20. No Carex pendula, Euphor-
bia amygdaloides, or Geum
rivale.
21. Numerous boundary sub-
pollards.
22. Ancient woodland plants:
Oxlip        No ivy carpet
(Mercury)    Cratae. oxy.
Carex rem
Paris
4518
23. Secondary woodland plants:
Sanicle      Anthriscus
Cherry       Viola odorata
All marginal.
24. Weak development of
mor under hornbeam, as
in Buff Wood.  But most of
the hornbesm, including that
on obviously acid gravel, does
not generate mor.
25. Aspen abundant (as in Hayley).
26. Bluebells extremely impressive and
density hardly improved in Hayley.
       History.
Main wood
Certainly ancient, despite
the apparent change shown in
Chapman & Andre (presumbly
due to incomplete surveying).
[14518-14519]
4518
Earthwork evidence very
strong: vegetation strong;
surface features inconclusive;
woodland structure very strong 
(giant ash stools even in
wettest areas).
  Hornbeam appears to
be a gregarious constituent
of mixed coppice.  No reason
to suspect planting: the stools
appear to form an uneven
aged population and no
rows could be found.  No
trace of an earthwork across
the base of the northern lobe
could be found.  Clear evi-
dence that the northern
hornbeam has increased in
density at the expense of
4519
ash and perhaps other coppice
trees. The S.W. hornbeam may
similarly have increased at the
expense of bracken glades.  Horn-
beam was probably in the past 
a fairly invasive species artif-
icially favoured.
  Earthworks suggest that
originally the wood came right
up to the A11 and was later
reduced by a roadside clearing.
The inner bank is probably
intended as a further clearing,
but it is not certain whether 
this was carried out.  Little
vegetation evidence (daffodils,
somewhat greater concentration
of hornbeam). Most of the pits
are in this area (but none in
the present roadside clearing).
[14520-14521]
4520
South portion
  Almost certainly old secon-
dary woodland (before Chapman 
& Andre). Banks & woodland 
structure agree.  Only site for
cherry.  Mercury very scarce at
S. end (?because it has only
just got across the intervening
bracken area).
  The present S. bank of the
main wood, strong with numerous
subpollards not in other banks,
was probably intended as a 
boundary betweeen the old wood
and adjoining woodland to the [????].
If so, the southern woodland
may have extended further w[????]
than it does now; but the
topography of the field S. of the
wood, and the failure of the
4521
roadside earthworks to run on
into this field, suggests that this
hypothetical woodland did not
reach the road.

  Replanting has as yet
done little damage to the wood
or its internal relationships.
The new proposals would frag-
ment the wood, destroy all the
pure hornbeam areas,sand
leave little of the transitions
between hornbeam and other
woodland types.

       History.
Probably secondary woodland,
pre-1805.  Srong evidence
from name, earthworks, wood-
land structure: vegetation
evidence less strong and
suggests some continuity
with ancient woodland, e.g.
via heathland or hedges.
  The scarcity of mercury in
a wood of this age is inter-
esting.
  Hemmed in by gardens 
to the E. which perhaps ex-
plains some of the plants (e.g.
Aegopodium).

Presence of hornbeam.

  Cherry is highly correla-
ted with secondary woodland
(as defined on the evidence of
earthworks). Absent from Payns-
den which is thought to be
wholly primary.
  Hornbeam is particularly
abundant in sec. woodland,
and largely confined to it in
Broom.  In Brtoom & Paynsden
it is used in the wood hedge
and may have been encouraged
for the purpose.  But Paynsden
and Quendon provide a series
of occurrences in apparently
primary woodland from rarity
to dominance.  It is gregarious
4547
and its apparent absence from
the old part o fBroom may
be due to chance.
  Paynsden and Quendon
are complementary in drain-
age and overlap in presumed
texture & pH.
