  Cherry is abundant near
the roadside in the area S. of
A.  It occurs chiefly as
poles here and elsewhere
along the roadside.  It has pro-
bably been selected for in
the replanting.
  North of C the W. boun-
dary contains a few oak
semi-pollards ([SYMBOL] 26). There is
also one yew tree c. 3ft
high but many years old.
  The deep notch in this
boundary does not appear to
be continued by any internal
feature.
  The north end is a
flat and probably wet
area, the only site for [????]
4459
in the wood. Said to contain
daffodil.
  The ditch across the
N.W. salient has recently
been severely deepened and
the pond shown on the O.S.
has disappeared.
  Area E ha been dras-
tically planted in rows with
scrub between derived from
the woodland.  It has a
well-marked but overgrown
boundary hedge which is
intact, including many
woodland species.
  At F the N.-S. boundary
ditch is continued by a
ditch in the same line but
very different in character
[14460-14461]
4460
with a large bank on the
E. side.
  There is one fair-sized
pollard oak on the wood
boundary against Burney
Wood. This area is a complex
of wood and field boundaries
with some massive hedges.
  The internal ditch
running through the wood
at this point is nearly
straight, mostly symmetrical,
and recently cleaned out.
It runs into a large rect-
angular pond.
Ride.  HB passes through
similar woodland types to
this ditch. In both, bracken
is locally dense in an area
4461
with little coppice.  There [!!!!]
is a larger area of "semi-
-neutral" woodland dom-
inated by brambles but
with ash coppice (as inb
Somersham Park).  [!!!!]
  A somewhat similar wood-
land type occurs in area I
by the roadside (here modi-
fied by the absence of
large coppice). It is said to
contain foxglove.
        Features.
1.  Very remarkable valley
situation.
2. Massive bank against
road.  Typical wood-bank in
S. part of W. side.  Other
