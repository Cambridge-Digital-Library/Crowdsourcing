SURREY
23 February 1977
Camberley, Bagshot, Sunningdale
Much birch woodland.
Nearly all B. pendula which is
the commonest sp. in this area.

Several great pollard oaks
by roadside, Sunningdale Sq 96.

Virginia Water.
Dam is some 20ft high, over a
quite narrow ravine. Many
sarsen boulders piled to form a 
waterfall.

Wood on S. side of Virginia.
PHYTOPHTHORA - many exuda-
tions, to c. 25ft anove ground on
very large moribund Betula 
pendula. Opposite h[????]

Birch - mostly pendula.
Some pubescens near the lake.
Oak all robur.
Dense rhododendrons.
Many Castanea standards.
Only old tree is an oak
by the Blacknest gate

of which fragments survive.
Part appears to be former farm-
land; several acute banks
remain, inlcuding one with a
row of oak stubs just off the
bank and one with several
oak pollards.
Most of the area is
either conifer plantations of c. 50
years' growth of birch woodland.
Birches rather sparse, forming 
typically about 80% cover.

[18132-18133]

Mistleto on old thorns.
Age - structure very variable.
Most areas contain trees of about
30 years' growth. Some places 
have a moribund older genera-
tion as well. Some of the 30-
-year birches have 2-3 stems,
but no positive evidence of
coppicing was found.
Ground vegetation chiefly
bracken. Commonest heathland
relict is Erica cinerea.
On the plateau most birches
are B. pendula, though hybrids
are common, and [!!!!]its[!!!!] single trees of
B. pubescens are frequent. A
few compartments have a majo-
rity of pubescens. In the valley
bottom, however, pubescens pre=
dominates.

A clone of Populus tremula
in the wettest part of the valley
bottom.
It is unusual to find any
individual birch that has all
the character of either sp. Dr
Jones has evidently a very similar
set of characters for demarcating
the species to mine. He points
out that bosses in the trunk
[which may be incipient witches'
brooms] are commoner in pubescens.
