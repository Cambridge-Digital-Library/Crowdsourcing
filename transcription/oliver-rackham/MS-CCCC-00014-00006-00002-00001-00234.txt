SURREY
23 February 1977
Camberley, Bagshot, Sunningdale
Much birch woodland.
Nearly all B. pendula which is
the commonest sp. in this area.

Several great pollard oaks
by roadside, Sunningdale Sq 96.

Virginia Water.
Dam is some 20ft high, over a
quite narrow ravine. Many
sarsen boulders piled to form a 
waterfall.

Wood on S. side of Virginia.
PHYTOPHTHORA - many exuda-
tions, to c. 25ft anove ground on
very large moribund Betula 
pendula. Opposite h[????]

Birch - mostly pendula.
Some pubescens near the lake.
Oak all robur.
Dense rhododendrons.
Many Castanea standards.
Only old tree is an oak

of which fragments survive.
Part appears to be former farm-
land; several acute banks
remain, inlcuding one with a
row of oak stubs just off the
bank and one with several
oak pollards.
Most of the area is
either conifer plantations of c. 50
years' growth of birch woodland.
Birches rather sparse, forming 
typically about 80% cover.

[18132-18133]

8132

Mistleto on old thorns.
Age - structure very variable.
Most areas contain trees of about
30 years' growth. Some places 
have a moribund older genera-
tion as well. Some of the 30-
-year birches have 2-3 stems,
but no positive evidence of
coppicing was found.
Ground vegetation chiefly
bracken. Commonest heathland
relict is Erica cinerea.
On the plateau most birches
are B. pendula, though hybrids
are common, and [!!!!]its[!!!!] single trees of
B. pubescens are frequent. A
few compartments have a majo-
rity of pubescens. In the valley
bottom, however, pubescens pre=
dominates.

A clone of Populus tremula

bottom.
It is unusual to find any
individual birch that has all
the character of either sp. Dr
Jones has evidently a very similar
set of characters for demarcating
the species to mine. He points
out that bosses in the trunk
[which may be incipient witches'
brooms] are commoner in pubescens.

He was unaware of the fluted
trunk of pubescens, which is
conspicuous in these trees.
Pendula, which Jones regards
as a ruderal species, is
much the commonest of the two
everywhere from Camberley to
Egham.
PHYTOPHTHORA. Frequent on
birch near Longcross, around
Virginia water, and in Windsor
Park and Forest. Often on
senescent or suppressed trees.
Rather runny exudations, not
now flowing.

Some very expensive houses
have been built in these woods.
The noise and fumes from the

The grove along the S. side of

Green has been felled. Many
oaks and other timber trees left

Ely and N.E. Nants. Mainly
C-type and gc.
Around the church at
Mepal is a stand of several
hundred c-type elms, partly
pollards, in grass - apparently

village.
Earthworks at Mepal con-
tinue into the Ouse Washes.
The Ouse Washes at Mepal

book advice of beekeepers. No
obvious source of beetles except
a small pile of elm logs.
Huntingdons account for
at least 90% of the elms in
the town.

Beetle pricks in the lower

only Ug in the road and the

less than usual.
Flowering of hollandica
elms around Santon Downham

Upware are mostly in good
condition. Several hundred small
hedgerow pollards, mostly cut

disease.

about 1/3 of original trees
survive. Tilia hybrid,

Great [SYMBOL] oak on W. facing

?Opeg. lyncea (ste[????]le). Redrotted.
Prob fairly fast grown for an old

5" - 9" thick. Pale yellow
rot & various kinds of insect
attack, including fingersized
holes.

Beech near Hall. Blown in
Jan. 76 gales. 204 y. 47" at
c. 5' up. Uprooted, but extensive
squamous decay thro'out trunk.

The Old Oak 833705 
Victorian railing.
27' 10' girth. Pollard 2 main stems
(3rd [SYMBOL] & 4th has fallen [SYMBOL] many years ago), very hollow,
c. 12 rings to the in.
Small[SYMBOL]ish cornw in relation to
girth.
Moderately burry - has
several smal branches low
down. Huge hollow with red-rot.

[18152-18153]

8152

No evidence of recent exten-
sion of decay. Tall erect
habit. Some of the upper boughs
have recently been shortened.

The park is mostly short
grassland, grazed by sheep.
Quite rich in species. The 
best parts are the western
slope - with Erophila and
other annuals, Rumex aceto 0 
sells (tenuifolius), occasional 
Cladonia foliacea, &c. on 
male - and rabbit-disturbance -
and the slope S. of Culford
Hall, with Cx arenaria.
Tree generations:
1. The Old Oak.
2. Younger oaks, ?c.400 years,
mostly maidens but including

8153

a few [SYMBOL]s. Scattered thro'out,
total about 12 trees.
3. A few sweet-chestnuts &
elms, possibly some great limes, c.300y.
4. Many suckering elms,
oaks, beeches, and limes, inclu-
ding those in avenues. About 
200 years.
5. Numerous younger trees in-
cluding hornbeams. The elms
have given rise to groves of 
elm poles & suckers.
6. Recent colonization chiefly
by elm, some hawthorn (espe-
cially in N.W.), alder in 
fen, surprisingly little birch
(chiefly in N.W.), occasional
oak.
Park is full of low banks
& earthworks, some of which

[18154-18155]

8154

influence the 100-ft contour.
Some may be headland ridges.
Not obviously related to posi-
tions of old oaks or elms
clones.
About 6 ancient hawthorns,
some well lichenized.
Rabbit scrapes numerous
but droppings few. A few
were seen towards evening
on the slope below the
Hall.
Magnificent Wellingtonia

Elm Disease has killed
about 60% of the freestanding
elms & small groves, but is
very irregular in its incidence.
Has had much less effect on
elms in the boundary groves.
