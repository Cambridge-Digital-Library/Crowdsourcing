SURREY
23 February 1977
Camberley, Bagshot, Sunningdale
Much birch woodland.
Nearly all B. pendula which is
the commonest sp. in this area.

Several great pollard oaks
by roadside, Sunningdale Sq 96.

Virginia Water.
Dam is some 20ft high, over a
quite narrow ravine. Many
sarsen boulders piled to form a 
waterfall.

Wood on S. side of Virginia.
PHYTOPHTHORA - many exuda-
tions, to c. 25ft anove ground on
very large moribund Betula 
pendula. Opposite h[????]

Birch - mostly pendula.
Some pubescens near the lake.
Oak all robur.
Dense rhododendrons.
Many Castanea standards.
Only old tree is an oak
by the Blacknest gate

of which fragments survive.
Part appears to be former farm-
land; several acute banks
remain, inlcuding one with a
row of oak stubs just off the
bank and one with several
oak pollards.
Most of the area is
either conifer plantations of c. 50
years' growth of birch woodland.
Birches rather sparse, forming 
typically about 80% cover.

[18132-18133]

Mistleto on old thorns.
Age - structure very variable.
Most areas contain trees of about
30 years' growth. Some places 
have a moribund older genera-
tion as well. Some of the 30-
-year birches have 2-3 stems,
but no positive evidence of
coppicing was found.
Ground vegetation chiefly
bracken. Commonest heathland
relict is Erica cinerea.
On the plateau most birches
are B. pendula, though hybrids
are common, and [!!!!]its[!!!!] single trees of
B. pubescens are frequent. A
few compartments have a majo-
rity of pubescens. In the valley
bottom, however, pubescens pre=
dominates.

A clone of Populus tremula

bottom.
It is unusual to find any
individual birch that has all
the character of either sp. Dr
Jones has evidently a very similar
set of characters for demarcating
the species to mine. He points
out that bosses in the trunk
[which may be incipient witches'
brooms] are commoner in pubescens.

He was unaware of the fluted
trunk of pubescens, which is
conspicuous in these trees.
Pendula, which Jones regards
as a ruderal species, is
much the commonest of the two
everywhere from Camberley to
Egham.
PHYTOPHTHORA. Frequent on
birch near Longcross, around
Virginia water, and in Windsor
Park and Forest. Often on
senescent or suppressed trees.
Rather runny exudations, not
now flowing.

Some very expensive houses
have been built in these woods.
The noise and fumes from the

very disagreeable.

Vast numbers of anthills in
old pasture, Brandon Fen. Most
abundant in slight hollows which

28 Feb.
The grove along the S. side of
the road from Anvil Cross to H[????]
Green has been felled. Many
oaks and other timber trees left
standing. Apparently not an 
ancient wood: no woodbanks or

big stools.
The Anil Cross elm whose
leaves were damaged two years ago
remains alive.
HATFIELD FOREST.

CHALKNEY WOOD.

The procera-type elms
at the Grange Rd - Sidgwick

heavily this year.
HAYLEY WOOD
7 March.

8141

Copious flowering of elms
in many places in the Isle of 
Ely and N.E. Nants. Mainly
C-type and gc.
Around the church at
Mepal is a stand of several
hundred c-type elms, partly
pollards, in grass - apparently
the remains of a shrunken
village.
Earthworks at Mepal con-
tinue into the Ouse Washes.
The Ouse Washes at Mepal
& Earith are about half flooded.
The main road at Earith
is about 1 ft above the
average level of the Washes
and the present floodwater.

book advice of beekeepers. No
obvious source of beetles except
a small pile of elm logs.
Huntingdons account for
at least 90% of the elms in
the town.

Beetle pricks in the lower
20ft of an Ug, c. 1 1/2 ft dia,
in West Road, Cambridge. The
only Ug in the road and the
only tree attacked.

[18144-18145]

8144

Ulnus procera along the
Backs is flowering very copi-
ously. Huntingdon elms rather
less than usual.
Flowering of hollandica
elms around Santon Downham
rather less than usual.

Upware are mostly in good
condition. Several hundred small
hedgerow pollards, mostly cut
