[SYMB] July 4 1968 749 [SYMB]MYPTO[SYMB]
  The town of Males is rather
indistinct at the edges (like 
Anatoli) where there are various semi-derelict buildings
and tenements.
While walking about these
and examioning a Salvia [????]
[????] ([SYMBOL]297) I was stopped by
a man who asked what I was
doing. I explained that I was a 
[SYMBOL] andn before I could
explain he had snatched away
my knife and collected a whole
armful of this plant, discoursing the
while on its medicinal virtues.
He then led me into a close
containing goats, which had left
little but Mentha ([SYMBOL]296) of which
[10750-10751]
750
he collected another huge bundle.
He then took me to the Marri-
bium ([SYMBOL]295 and did the same.
His wife [????] had been loudly
calling him to supper, and it
was doubtless this rather than
my protests that led him to de-
sist. I had to walk back carrying
these ungainly burdens to the 
astonishment of the people of
Males and got lost in the alleys
to boot.
The [SYMBOL] family were
very kind. A daughter was anxious
to practise English. We dined off
[SYMBOL] made of marrow
flowes stuffed with meat. This
is a 2-storeyed house with
an upstairs balcony and
about 10 rooms, There is a 
garden. It is just outside the
old town.
Vines are grown over the 
house to form a verandah,
and are grown on a small scale
around the village.
[10752-10753]

July 5
[SYMBOL]
A rambling village hanging
on a remendous hillside. Rather 
less crowded than [SYMBOL]. Reached
from [SYMBOL] by a good but
narrow and unpaved road. [SYMBOL]31
Immense olive orchards
clothe the slopes below the 
village but come no higher.
[SYMBOL], a small village
on a flat hill-top, appears quite
derelict apart from the church which
is beautifully kept.
[SYMBOL]
The path ascends steeply
from [SYMBOL]: towards the top
it has several zigzags and a 
flight of steps. It is an excel-
lent mule-track, as broad as a 
narrow road, the only way into
thos fertile valley. It appears
not to have been repaired since
the Turkish period.
One enters the narrow valley
of [SYMBOL] and passes over
a low and hardly perceptible 
saddle into [SYMBOL]. Between
is the rugged ridge of [SYMBOL]
clothed in Quercus coccifera
(p.762f).
THe cultivated areas in [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] is like that in [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL], but with only a few
huts. It is separated from the 
main area of cultivation by
the pine wood of p.764.

The main cultivated area
in [SYMBOL] consists of small
roughly square fields levelled
by terracing on slopes of c. 3 [SYMBOL]
Numerous little stone houses, none
now occupied (they appear to be
lived in earlier in the season).
Chielfly arable, mainly cereals & 
potatoes, now all harvested. Small
amounts of irrigation, some
channels still running, but in
poor repair. Intersected by
numerous complex paths around
the edges of fields. Terraces
with dry-stone walling.
The soil (as in [SYMBOL]) is
yellow, deep in places, evidently
alluvial although the ground 
is by no means flat.

and much vegetation is still 
green.
Persons seen
1. A girl of about 10 who came
up with me from [SYMBOL] and
explained various plants such as
[SYMBOL]* in the lower valley.
She eventually disappeared to
some settlement in [SYMBOL]
2. 2 people working in "[SYMBOL]"
3. The 3 men of [SYMBOL]7 (p. )
who insisted on being photographed,
with two mules carrying fire-
wood (not identified, but not oak)
and dead sheep (of the "alpine"
kind, lightly built, with slender
heads and long ears. Note the 
dog (affable, breed not recognised)
* cf place name "Asferdami"
[10758-10759]
758
4. A solitary gamekeeper-like
man met near th tree-linem who
was surprised to find a stranger
there, and somewhat less forth-
coming
Lazaros us a steep hillside
with scrub and a few pines
below, continuing above the tree
line to bare rolling heights simi-
lar to Dicte and Aphendis Christos.
To the E. are rather abrupt
hills with much wood and scrub
(towards [SYMBOL]).
The [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] range
has a fairly sharp tree-line
at c. 1600m Above this is
bare white limestone with some
vegetation near the summit.
Between [SYMBOL] and
[SYMBOL] is a large cypress
tree c 1ft diam. by the road-
side.
Mystus [SYMBOL] by water courses
Blackstonia [SYMBOL]
Platanus orientalis is abun-
dant by the stream between
M. and X. A large tree with
the habit of the beech but
somewhat tortuous. Very
uneven aged wiht many
[10760-10761]
760
young trees.
Ivy occurs by this river
on a [????] wall.
The largest plane has an
ivied trunk some 2 1/2 ft dia.
and pendulous branches.

Bromus madrit.
761
Dracunculus freq.
On rendzina over hard
limestone.
This is at c. 800 m.
on the shoulder of the 
[!!!!]Aria [SYMBOL] valley, near the
cypresses. The olive is
not cultivated above 650m.
and does not enter the
valley, where pears and
almonds replace it.
The carob does not
come above Males at all.
Oleander is abundant
in lower Selakano to c.
1000m. Vitex does not occur
above [SYMBOL]
[10762-10763]

Kermes Oak
Largest trees c. 3 ft dia.
Annial rings very inconspicuous
One felled [!!!!] 33 in. across
15 rings to 9/16 in.
Another 14 in. c. 120 years.
Young ones occur but not
often. There are many small
bush trees which show signs
of browzing, but even when
they get clear of the goats they
grow very slowly.
Usually an orchard-like
wood of trees c. [????]0 ft high
with clean boles & rounded
crowns. Mainly on limestone
but also volcanic [????]
Understorey varies from
tall closed Calycotome maquis
almost to Coridithyhmus 
garrigue.
Calycotome
Ononis
Coridithymus
Poterium
Cardiopatium
Eryngium (yellow)

The open Kermes woods
begin on the S. side of the
[!!!!][SYMBOL] valley very near
the entrance, at c. 850 m.,
and continue uninterruptedly
on the S. side, and less
continuously on the N., to
the tree line. Never a closed
forest.
[SYMBOL]34 - large spreading tree
near entrance.

[10764-10765]
Pinus Brutia forest on Serpentine
There is an outcrop of
serpentine & associated hae-
matite &c in the middle 
of the Selakano valley. Soils
usually much eroded, but 
some persisting even on steep
slopes. Slopes mostly 20 [SYMBOL]
or more, various aspects,
Quercus coccifera is
mostly absenr. Its place is
taken by P. Brutia forest.
Trees forming an open canopy,
well-grown, up to about
15 in. dia. Many young 
trees & saplings but no
dead trees & few recently 
felled.
Shrubs few and scattered
with large patches of bare
ground.
Herbs very few: a few
thistles and probably scanty
annuals. Many lichens & bryophytes.
Note the remarkable woody tuberous Trifolium
(p. )
This serpentine outcrop
although probably deeply
weathered is not cultivated,
in contrast to the rest of
the Selakano basin whose
soils are either alluvial or
desrived from marls.
Specimen of serpentine
from here.
Intermediate in vegetation
betwee the [SYMBOL] and
[SYMBOL] outcrops of serpentine.
[10766-10767]

310-215 (small polythene
bag) from volcanic soil
with scattered Kermes.
Morus nigra is grown in
the Salakano valley. The 
fruits are now falling.
Ferula is infrequent in
terrace walls here [SYMBOL]36
Adiantum fringes the
watercourses.
Rhizocarpon occurs on
jasper or haematite in Sala-
kanos.

Kermes Woodland 1080m
On steep slopes of hard
limestone soil between
rendzine and terra rossa, and
like the latter in places, 
very truncated & covering about 
half the surface.

Kermes very uneven in
size. Largest trees c. 30 ft x
c. 3 ft. Many bushes to
3 in. but none apparently
very young. Many are 6-20
ft high and these put in 3-5
in. in a series of presumably
annual flushes. They have
already formed their terminal
buds.
Euphorbia acanthothamnos 329
Largest bushes 6 ft across &
2 ft high. Main stems tortuous,
3 in. diam Most bushes
now shedding their leaves.
[10768-10769]

occurring from c. 1050 m. up
to the tree line. [!!!!]large[!!!!] Small
rounded bushes with leaves 
in the interior, like Potenium
spinosum in habit.

[10770-10771]
770
Pine Forest
One of the largest trees
23" over bark
50-55 years, very little growth
in last 20
An area of pine wood
mainly on the N. sde of
the valley, on fairly level
ground with a S. aspect.
Trees up to c. 40 ft high,
with the usual habit of
Cretan pines. Uneven - aged
but probably even-aged in
patches. No other trees in
any numbers. Some have
a tendency to pioneer habit.
Undergrowth of grasses with
some large Fumana along
the path. Firest patchy in
771
density but quite dense in 
places.
Much litter but little
humus.
Few stumps.
Few or no lichens. Bark
very rugged, black, staining
black other objects (e.g. trunk
of small maple tree) under-
neath.
No sign of any previous
vegetation being different.
Nonetheless, there is a strong
suggestion that this forest
is of quire recent origin.
Tops of pines not cut off
(unusual in Crete).
Fomes formentarius. On pine
stump.

[10772-10773]
772
344 forms rounded
cushions up to 2 ft dia.
and c. 6 in. thick, with
vicious spines from the per-
sistent leaf tips.
345 grass in the protection
of 344.
344 is referred to as the 
"spiny Anthyllis". [Astragulus
creticum]
Above the pine woods, a 
park forest of Quercus coc-
cifera appears. Present 
grazing appears to be much
more severe than anywhere
else seen. Soil confined to 
pockets of rock and illuvial
areas in bottom of vallet &
side valleys.
