  The town of Males is rather
indistinct at the edges (like 
Anatoli) where there are various semi-derelict buildings
and tenements.
While walking about these
and examioning a Salvia [!!!!]
[!!!!] ([SYMBOL]297) I was stopped by
a man who asked what I was
doing. I explained that I was a 
[SYMBOL] andn before I could
explain he had snatched away
my knife and collected a whole
armful of this plant, discoursing the
while on its medicinal virtues.
He then led me into a close
containing goats, which had left
little but Mentha ([SYMBOL]296) of which
[10750-10751]
750
he collected another huge bundle.
He then took me to the Marri-
bium ([SYMBOL]295 and did the same.
His wife [!!!!] had been loudlt
calling him to supper, and it
was doubtless this rather than
my protests that led him to de-
sist. I had to walk back carrying
these ungainly burdens to the 
astonishment of the people of
Males and got lost in the alleys
to boot.
The [SYMBOL] family were
very kind. A daughter was anxious
to practise English. We dined off
[SYMBOL] made of marrow
flowes stuffed with meat. This
is a 2-storeyed house with
an upstairs balcony and
about 10 rooms, There is a 
garden. It is just outside the
old town.
Vines are grown over the 
house to form a verandah,
and are grown on a small scale
around the village.
