  The town of Males is rather
indistinct at the edges (like 
Anatoli) where there are various semi-derelict buildings
and tenements.
While walking about these
and examioning a Salvia [!!!!]
[!!!!] ([SYMBOL]297) I was stopped by
a man who asked what I was
doing. I explained that I was a 
[SYMBOL] andn before I could
explain he had snatched away
my knife and collected a whole
armful of this plant, discoursing the
while on its medicinal virtues.
He then led me into a close
containing goats, which had left
little but Mentha ([SYMBOL]296) of which
[10750-10751]
750
he collected another huge bundle.
He then took me to the Marri-
bium ([SYMBOL]295 and did the same.
His wife [!!!!] had been loudlt
calling him to supper, and it
was doubtless this rather than
my protests that led him to de-
sist. I had to walk back carrying
these ungainly burdens to the 
astonishment of the people of
Males and got lost in the alleys
to boot.
The [SYMBOL] family were
very kind. A daughter was anxious
to practise English. We dined off
[SYMBOL] made of marrow
flowes stuffed with meat. This
is a 2-storeyed house with
an upstairs balcony and
about 10 rooms, There is a 
garden. It is just outside the
old town.
Vines are grown over the 
house to form a verandah,
and are grown on a small scale
around the village.
[10752-10753]

July 5
[SYMBOL]
A rambling village hanging
on a remendous hillside. Rather 
less crowded than [SYMBOL]. Reached
from [SYMBOL] by a good but
narrow and unpaved road. [SYMBOL]31
Immense olive orchards
clothe the slopes below the 
village but come no higher.
[SYMBOL], a small village
on a flat hill-top, appears quite
derelict apart from the church which
is beautifully kept.
[SYMBOL]
The path ascends steeply
from [SYMBOL]: towards the top
it has several zigzags and a 
flight of steps. It is an excel-
lent mule-track, as broad as a 
narrow road, the only way into
thos fertile valley. It appears
not to have been repaired since
the Turkish period.
One enters the narrow valley
of [SYMBOL] and passes over
a low and hardly perceptible 
saddle into [SYMBOL]. Between
is the rugged ridge of [SYMBOL]
clothed in Quercus coccifera
(p.762f).
THe cultivated areas in [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] is like that in [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL], but with only a few
huts. It is separated from the 
main area of cultivation by
the pine wood of p.764.

The main cultivated area
in [SYMBOL] consists of small
roughly square fields levelled
by terracing on slopes of c. 3 [SYMBOL]
Numerous little stone houses, none
now occupied (they appear to be
lived in earlier in the season).
Chielfly arable, mainly cereals & 
potatoes, now all harvested. Small
amounts of irrigation, some
channels still running, but in
poor repair. Intersected by
numerous complex paths around
the edges of fields. Terraces
with dry-stone walling.
The soil (as in [SYMBOL]) is
yellow, deep in places, evidently
alluvial although the ground 
is by no means flat.

and much vegetation is still 
green.
Persons seen
1. A girl of about 10 who came
up with me from [SYMBOL] and
explained various plants such as
[SYMBOL]* in the lower valley.
She eventually disappeared to
some settlement in [SYMBOL]
2. 2 people working in "[SYMBOL]"
3. The 3 men of [SYMBOL]7 (p. )
who insisted on being photographed,
with two mules carrying fire-
wood (not identified, but not oak)
and dead sheep (of the "alpine"
kind, lightly built, with slender
heads and long ears. Note the 
dog (affable, breed not recognised)
