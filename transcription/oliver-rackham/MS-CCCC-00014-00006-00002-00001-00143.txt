  The town of Males is rather
indistinct at the edges (like 
Anatoli) where there are various semi-derelict buildings
and tenements.
While walking about these
and examioning a Salvia [????]
[????] ([SYMBOL]297) I was stopped by
a man who asked what I was
doing. I explained that I was a 
[SYMBOL] andn before I could
explain he had snatched away
my knife and collected a whole
armful of this plant, discoursing the
while on its medicinal virtues.
He then led me into a close
containing goats, which had left
little but Mentha ([SYMBOL]296) of which
[10750-10751]
750
he collected another huge bundle.
He then took me to the Marri-
bium ([SYMBOL]295 and did the same.
His wife [????] had been loudly
calling him to supper, and it
was doubtless this rather than
my protests that led him to de-
sist. I had to walk back carrying
these ungainly burdens to the 
astonishment of the people of
Males and got lost in the alleys
to boot.
The [SYMBOL] family were
very kind. A daughter was anxious
to practise English. We dined off
[SYMBOL] made of marrow
flowes stuffed with meat. This
is a 2-storeyed house with
an upstairs balcony and
about 10 rooms, There is a 
garden. It is just outside the
old town.
Vines are grown over the 
house to form a verandah,
and are grown on a small scale
around the village.

July 5
[SYMBOL]
A rambling village hanging
on a remendous hillside. Rather 
less crowded than [SYMBOL]. Reached
from [SYMBOL] by a good but
narrow and unpaved road. [SYMBOL]31
Immense olive orchards
clothe the slopes below the 
village but come no higher.
[SYMBOL], a small village
on a flat hill-top, appears quite
derelict apart from the church which
is beautifully kept.
[SYMBOL]
The path ascends steeply
from [SYMBOL]: towards the top
it has several zigzags and a 
flight of steps. It is an excel-
lent mule-track, as broad as a 
narrow road, the only way into
thos fertile valley. It appears
not to have been repaired since
the Turkish period.
One enters the narrow valley
of [SYMBOL] and passes over
a low and hardly perceptible 
saddle into [SYMBOL]. Between
is the rugged ridge of [SYMBOL]
clothed in Quercus coccifera
(p.762f).
THe cultivated areas in [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] is like that in [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL], but with only a few
huts. It is separated from the 
main area of cultivation by
the pine wood of p.764.

The main cultivated area
in [SYMBOL] consists of small
roughly square fields levelled
by terracing on slopes of c. 3 [SYMBOL]
Numerous little stone houses, none
now occupied (they appear to be
lived in earlier in the season).
Chielfly arable, mainly cereals & 
potatoes, now all harvested. Small
amounts of irrigation, some
channels still running, but in
poor repair. Intersected by
numerous complex paths around
the edges of fields. Terraces
with dry-stone walling.
The soil (as in [SYMBOL]) is
yellow, deep in places, evidently
alluvial although the ground 
is by no means flat.

green.
Persons seen
1. A girl of about 10 who came
up with me from [SYMBOL] and
explained various plants such as
[SYMBOL]* in the lower valley.
She eventually disappeared to
some settlement in [SYMBOL]
2. 2 people working in "[SYMBOL]"
3. The 3 men of [SYMBOL]7 (p. )
who insisted on being photographed,
with two mules carrying fire-
wood (not identified, but not oak)
and dead sheep (of the "alpine"
kind, lightly built, with slender
heads and long ears. Note the 
dog (affable, breed not recognised)

4. A solitary gamekeeper-like
man met near th tree-linem who
was surprised to find a stranger
there, and somewhat less forth-
coming
Lazaros us a steep hillside
with scrub and a few pines
below, continuing above the tree
line to bare rolling heights simi-
lar to Dicte and Aphendis Christos.
To the E. are rather abrupt
hills with much wood and scrub
(towards [SYMBOL]).
The [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] range
has a fairly sharp tree-line
at c. 1600m Above this is
bare white limestone with some
vegetation near the summit.
Between [SYMBOL] and
[SYMBOL] is a large cypress
tree c 1ft diam. by the road-
side.
Mystus [SYMBOL] by water courses
Blackstonia [SYMBOL]
Platanus orientalis is abun-
dant by the stream between
M. and X. A large tree with

Another 14 in. c. 120 years.
Young ones occur but not
often. There are many small
bush trees which show signs
of browzing, but even when
they get clear of the goats they
grow very slowly.
Usually an orchard-like
wood of trees c. [????]0 ft high
with clean boles & rounded
crowns. Mainly on limestone
but also volcanic [????]

and continue uninterruptedly
on the S. side, and less
continuously on the N., to
the tree line. Never a closed
forest.

[10764-10765]
Pinus Brutia forest on Serpentine
There is an outcrop of
serpentine & associated hae-
matite &c in the middle 
of the Selakano valley. Soils
usually much eroded, but 
some persisting even on steep
slopes. Slopes mostly 20 [SYMBOL]
or more, various aspects,
Quercus coccifera is
mostly absenr. Its place is
taken by P. Brutia forest.
Trees forming an open canopy,
well-grown, up to about
15 in. dia. Many young 
trees & saplings but no
dead trees & few recently 
felled.
Shrubs few and scattered
with large patches of bare
ground.
Herbs very few: a few
thistles and probably scanty
annuals. Many lichens & bryophytes.
Note the remarkable woody tuberous Trifolium
(p. )
This serpentine outcrop
although probably deeply
weathered is not cultivated,
in contrast to the rest of
the Selakano basin whose
soils are either alluvial or
desrived from marls.

Morus nigra is grown in
the Salakano valley. The 
fruits are now falling.
Ferula is infrequent in
terrace walls here [SYMBOL]36
Adiantum fringes the
watercourses.
Rhizocarpon occurs on
jasper or haematite in Sala-
kanos.

Kermes Woodland 1080m
On steep slopes of hard
limestone soil between
rendzine and terra rossa, and
like the latter in places, 
very truncated & covering about 
half the surface.

Kermes very uneven in
size. Largest trees c. 30 ft x
c. 3 ft. Many bushes to
3 in. but none apparently
very young. Many are 6-20
ft high and these put in 3-5
in. in a series of presumably
annual flushes. They have
already formed their terminal
buds.
Euphorbia acanthothamnos 329
Largest bushes 6 ft across &
2 ft high. Main stems tortuous,

Pine Forest
One of the largest trees
23" over bark
50-55 years, very little growth
in last 20
An area of pine wood
mainly on the N. sde of
the valley, on fairly level
ground with a S. aspect.
Trees up to c. 40 ft high,
with the usual habit of
Cretan pines. Uneven - aged
but probably even-aged in
patches. No other trees in
any numbers. Some have
a tendency to pioneer habit.
Undergrowth of grasses with
some large Fumana along
the path. Firest patchy in
771
density but quite dense in 
places.
Much litter but little
humus.
Few stumps.
Few or no lichens. Bark
very rugged, black, staining
black other objects (e.g. trunk
of small maple tree) under-
neath.
No sign of any previous
vegetation being different.
Nonetheless, there is a strong
suggestion that this forest
is of quire recent origin.
Tops of pines not cut off
(unusual in Crete).
Fomes formentarius. On pine
stump.

344 forms rounded
cushions up to 2 ft dia.
and c. 6 in. thick, with
vicious spines from the per-
sistent leaf tips.
345 grass in the protection
of 344.
344 is referred to as the 
"spiny Anthyllis". [Astragulus
creticum]
Above the pine woods, a 
park forest of Quercus coc-
cifera appears. Present 
grazing appears to be much
more severe than anywhere
else seen. Soil confined to 
pockets of rock and illuvial
areas in bottom of vallet &
side valleys.

Tree Line
Q. coccifera to 1700 m.
Above 1500 m. the trees are
very short and stout & usually
several-trunked. Very
windswept mainly from the 
W.
Most of the shrubs
listed for 1400m. attain the
tree-line.
Pines don not eceed
1400m. at which height
they are very windswept.
Maple sometimes occurs
as a small tree at the
tree-line: to c. 20 ft x 6 in.
Habit like the Kermes but
1-trunked. The maples are
being replaced by means of 
775
grazed bushes making
a leader. Growth of these is
very slow and they are bare
of branches on the W.
This maple, Acer monspes-
sularium, occurs only above
c.1100 m. in this valley.
About 1/10 as frequent as
the oaks, becoming more
abundant near the tree-line.
The other maple, A. orientale,
occurs locally from c. 850 m.
onwards. Near the tree 
line it forms the bulk of 
the grazed-down topiary
bushes but rarely grows
into a tree.

Cypresses in Selakano
At the top of the track
above [SYMBOL]. where it turns
the corner to enter the 
valley, are the only cypresses
seen in the valley. About 
six trees, among rocks on a 
steep S.E. facing shoulder, not 
evidently plated. Varying in
size but none young. The
largest are some 40 ft high
and c. 1 ft dia. Trunks very
zigzag and crooked. Big bran-
ches near the base - some
sawn off at some time in the
past. Foliage in heavy rounded
masses. No obvious leader. 
[10778-10779]
778
Weather in Selakano
Extremely windy from the
N. to N.W. While collecting
Dittany I was bombarded
by small stones blown off
a nearby scree - cf early
accounts of the winds on 
Ida.
All dat clouds hung
over the Dicte-Lazaros
range, and most of the
time over the [SYMBOL] range
also. A cloud wall perhaps
800 ft high stood on the
Dicte range, and continually 
rushed over the edge at high
speed, immediately to dissolve.
A very few drops of rain (quite un-
measurable) got blown over.

Cretan Dittany
[SYMBOL]
Quite
frequent
in upper Selakano, but
found flowering only oice,
at c. 1450 m. It occurs
on steep rock outcrops
(c. 70 [SYMBOL] or more) at the
top of screes. Confined to
small crevices in hard lime-
stone. Beautiful leaves with
thick light tomentum like
rabbit's wool. Flowers with
more blue tinge than in [SYMBOL].
By itself the plant has
a short external rhizome and 
several floweing stems. It
appears to be extremely sen-
sitive to goats, and where

[10780-10781]
780
within reach prodduces a few 
tiny leaves and is sterile.
Not apparently particular to
aspect: [SYMBOL] taken on a N.
aspect.
The leaves have a strong
indescribable scent, the most 
beautiful I have ever smelt,
rather like mint but with
a delicate sharp component like
lemon. It is used as tea and
before the war commanded
400 dr. the oke (cheap at the 
price!)
I was directed to this plant
by three very affable ruffianly
characters coming down from the
Dictaean Pass with 2 mules carry-
ing some firewood & dead sheep. 

781
Oak Woodland
The woods in the two areas
- upper valley and on [SYMBOL] -
are now discontinuous, though
the trees in [SYMBOL] suggest
that they were at one time
joined up.
Soil is confined to pockets
of limestone. Rock entirely
white limestone with soil-fillled
grykes and rounded ridges. Nu-
merous projecting rocks, especially
on [SYMBOL] ([SYMBOL]35) and cliff
lines, especially in the upper
valley. Seldom a typical lime-
stone pavement. On steep slopes
the surface is littered with
loose fragments; the cliffs are
rotten and there are consider-
[10782-10783]
782
able cones of fine scree in the
upper valley. Soil brown to yel-
low - not terra rosa. No evidence
of erosion around the bases of 
the oaks.
Tree-like appears to be fairly
sharp; above it on all the
mountains there appears to be
bare white limestone.
No admixture of pines, which
occur only in two small separ-
ate areas (p. 764 & 770).
Single trunks are usual
in the [SYMBOL] wood but multiple
trunts in the upper forest.
Never more than c. 4. This may
result from coppicing but more
likely from grazing when the 
tree was little.
cont. p. 785
783
cont p. 756
Fruit trees almonds & pears
generallt in terrace walls. This
is clearly not the main reason
for the settlement. Vines occa-
sional on houses only. A few
trees of Pyrus armygdaliformis
in Kermes woodland considerably
up the valley have been sought
out and grafted.
Kermes oaks grow around
houses, mainly around the edge
of the cultivated area. They
include [!!!!]some of the[!!!!] the largest seen in the
island, some 50 ft high, in habit
very like Q. ILex.
Poultry are kept at some
times around the houses.
Further up the [SYMBOL]
valley, limestone rocks appear
[10784-10785]
784
and there is a gradual trans-
ition to limestone pavement;
cultivation is restricted to illuvial
hollows and then disappears.
Arable is partly abandoned in
the upper parts of the settlement.
The scrubby Euphorbia
acanthothamnos woodland of p.
766 is on an island of rocks.
Numerous interesting weeds
in the cultivated lands, cf [SYMBOL]309(2)
-330. Spiny plants such as Cen-
taurea idaea ([SYMBOL]4) and Cichorium
spinosum ([SYMBOL]5) are particularly
chracteristic of the abandoned
arable in the upper cultivated
area.
Flowering times are con-
siderably later than on the coast
cont. p. 757
785
cont. p. 782
Felling exceptionally rare and
trees thus difficult to age (p. 762).
Possible pollarding near culti-
vation ([!!!!][SYMBOL]18) but this is un-
usual. Enormous worm holes
in exposed wood.
Grazing is still very severe,
possibly more so in the past [!!!!]
(young trees but no young-mid-
dle-aged). A flock of about 50
goats was seen. Two immense
billies with fine horns making
several turns were seen
fighting near the ruins of a 
hut. This is the only place
where goats were seen at large
in Crete. Unattended. Sheep are
said in Myrtos to collect in [SYMBOL]
tcavo in large numbers at cer-
[10786-10787]
876
tain seasons but no sign of 
this was seen and the informa-
tion may be out of date.
Igelheide (with very antipastoral
plants, like spiny Anthyllis) was
found only in teh bottom of the 
dry valley near the goats.
Damage to oaks by wind
([SYMBOL]10) is infrequent.
Regeneration ([SYMBOL]14) of both
oaks and maples is by forming
a "box hedge" which inches its
way up under continual grazing 
until eventually it gets out of
reach. This happens in the upper
but not the lower woods, p. 784f.
Oaks always spiny, but
sometimes less spiny than at
others ([SYMBOL]358).
787
Conclusions
The oak forest is probably
relict native [SYMBOL] primary vegetationn. The
present trees were probably 
established in Venetian or By-
zantine times and have 
survived through a period of 
more intense grazing. It is 
too sparse to permit fire (the
crowns of trees seldom touch).
It at present contains
rather few associated [SYMBOL] tree spp. (e.g.
Acer spp., possibly Pyrus). Cypress
might be a natural associate
selectively removed: there are 
rumours of "cedars" elsewhere 
in the Dictaean range. The
Q. Ilex apparently seen by
Tournefort is a problem: despite

[10788-10789]
788
searching none was found.
No evidence of substantial
erosion in the lifetime of the 
present trees.
Despite remoteness the ab-
sence of logging is very remark-
able.
The settlement is very dif-
ficult to date. Tournefort would
be expected to mention it but
does not. No evidence of an-
tiquity; but the terrace walls
and vegetation are well estab-
lished, and some areas have 
gone out of cultivation. The mud
road appears to be old, but
it is a strategic route and
could be older than the settle-
ment.
789
Pine woods are difficult
to interpret because the trees
are fast-growing and short-lived.
Possibly it is the native
tree on S. facing slopes and
special soils, e.g. serpentine.
Oaks around the settlement
could be relicts.
The variety of vegetation 
under oaks is remarkable
(but cf E. Anglian woods!) and 
shows that many heathland
types in Crete [!!!!] could be degraded
woodland.

Agave americana is
abundant in the plain of
Hierapetra planted as a 
hedge. It probably grows from
seed or else is shortly rhizo=
matous. Dead infls appear to
persist at least 2 years;
the scape may take a year 
to die. This year's infls are
much fewer than dead ones.
They vary considerably in
floweing time. Flowers
largem bright yellow.
The plant was seen be-
tween Hieraptera and Myrtos
and around the Merabello
[10794-10795]

Gulf, but infrequently.
Heraptera Bay
Frinded with gray sand and
shingle; no marine life.
For shore vegetation, see p, 
927f ([SYMBOL]366(1)-375(1)). Large
tracts of Agrostis and Mesembry-
anthemum. A great variety of 
Salsola forms.
Behind teh coast road
is a fringe of Agave and then
fallow (or derelict) arable with
dried-up weeds. Wind-pumps
of a propeller type.
The dunes and low [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] hills to the E. (702102)
have uninteresting grassland and
garrigue.

The soils of the Hieraptera
Gap, derived apparentlt mainly

[SYMBOL]

less and the cliff almost so
but the scree is about half
vegetated.
Nicotiana glaucea occurs
along the road a few 
miles S. of Ag. Nik.
There are large beds of
Phragmites (not [????]) in a 
brackish creek S. of Ag.
Nik. A large plant but
stems annual and infls
chracteristic.
The soils around the S.W.
of the Gulf of Merabello are
to a large extent terra rosa, 
often truncated by erosion. 
The oxidation colour often
runs to 20 ft under the 
surface in cracks even where
the surface soil has all
gone. There are also rend-
zinas usually in the softer
limestones & marls.

Habits of Snails
The white snails are abun-
dant within about a mile
of Hierapetra on either
side; they are less abundant
throughout the Hierapetra
plain; but not seen inland,
nor in the Myrtos area
except in very small numbers.
The reasons for this distri-
bution are not clear, but
may be agricultural: the
snails are apparently associ-
ated with abundant annu-
[10798-10799]
798
al vegetation earlier in the 
year. Particularly common
on land which has recently
gobe out of cultivation.
Their aestivating places
are upright objects of all 
sorts, including the tops of
bushes and dead herbs. In
such situations they may
aestivate 9 in. above the found.
When they meet fence posts,
Arundo windbreaks, dead 
Agave stumps, &c. they usu-
ally go to teh top or as near
as they can get without
crawling over one another; but
if there is a projection below
teh top (e.g. a wire) a
proportion of snails will stop
799
at it. A few climbed tele-
graph poles, reaching 20 ft
or more but not always
getting quite to the top. Tele-
graph poles and other tall 
uprights do not occur where
the snails are most abudant.
The snails reach the outer 
suburbs of Hieraptera but 
go no further in than the
extensive gardens do.
The snails do not appear 
to prefer any side of the
post.
Hierapetra Town

One mosque made into a church.
The fort (SYMBOL 19) is an ir-
regular square with immensely
thick walls and curious 2-cen-
tred battlements. Along the
seaward side is a platform
about 20 ft high with vaulted
rooms underneath. It is ap-
proached by a ramp and 
stands on massive barrel vaults.
Various buildings stand against 
the other walls. A small tower
is built over the land gate
and there is another partly
carried away by the sea. The
building is being repaired.

A tawdry Victorian church

A good fountain with an
inscription saying it was
built in the 1880s.
The village hangs to 
the bottom of the hills and
does not go down into the 
Plain.
The countryside around
(on the highland edge) is 
arable and pasture forming
a narrow fringe to the Plain.
Regular, though untidy, road-
side hedges of brambles and
827
hawthorn with numerous
herbs, especially Origanum
s. lat., but some of them
British ([SYMBOL]360(2)-378).

Quercus coccifera
Almost exclusively a
bush in the garrigue. On the
way up to the Cave it grows 
up to c. 10ft high in tall
scrub, and there are a very
few single-trunked trees to c.
40 ft high and 1 1/2 ft dia. The
occurrence of tall bushes sug-
gests it is not grazing only
which prevents it from forming
a tree. [SYMBOL] 384 (p. 972).

Dictaean Cave
[DIAGRAM]

Opens quite unexpectedly
out of the hillside. There is
a vast wood overhanging the en-
trance. The descent is a break-
-neck one over boulders covered
with a brown slippery film of
wet silt. The shaft goes down
into the hillside with a shallow
lake of indefinite extent at
the bottom: at some times of
[10830-10831]
830
year this is dry. At the 
bottom a short side-passage
contains a large rugged yellow
stalactite pillar: this is the 
reputed birth-cave and contained
the votive bronzes (Petter Warren).
The cave is rather poor
in bryophytes and flowering
plants. The transition to total
darkness is abrupt. [SYMBOL]386-7 (p. )
It emerges from a [!!!!]
vast limestone hillside traversed
by large dry gullies. Around
and below the cave is tall 
Quercus coccifera scrub forming
a patchily closed evergreen maquis.
Numerous herbs including a fine
yellow Teucrium ([SYMBOL]30)
831
Lassithi PLain
A vast almost dead flat
expanse, completely surrounded
by higher ground; the lowest
point on the rim, some 20 ft
above the plain, is where the
road to the N. leaves it.
Soil is a pale brown silt
(exposed to c. 3 ft deep in an
erosion gully) with irregular
intercalated layers of gravel.
The surrounding hills are
mostly very barren save at 
their bases; the internal hill
(near [SYMBOL]) is very
barren.
For crops see p. 819-20
The field systems are
mostly rectilinear, but seldom
[10832-10833]
832
regular for any long distances,
and the boundaries often not
at right angles. Occasional
curved boundaries. It looks
as if original large fields
have been divided up in as
regular a manner as could
be contrived (cf English inclo-
sures). [SYMBOL]28,29.
Many narrow driftways 
among fields, ofteneroded down.
Trees almost all in field
boundaries.
Small patches of vines fre-
quent.
Fences mostly barbed wire:
few stiock.
Most of the irrigation mills
were still at midday, but
833
began to turn in the afternoon

About the time of the wheat
& oats harvest.
The variety of crops is re-
markable.

Descent to [SYMBOL]
We left the Plain through
the picturesque old town of
[SYMBOL] by the N. exit,
where there is a good tarred
road.
There is a very picturesque
descent down a steep gullied
mountainside with tall garrigue
past the monastery of [SYMBOL].
The complex, hilly, and rather
fertile plateau of [SYMBOL] is
[10834-10835]
834
crossed. We took the unsurfaced
road through [SYMBOL], a large
and rather bleak village.
The descent from [SYMBOL] to
[SYMBOL] was spectacular. A road
has been blasted out of the terra
rossa hillside but never fin-
ished, and the projecting boulders
are a serious hazard to the
car's clearance. A tractor
passed us but the road
is becoming overgrown and
can be little used. Peter &
Elizabeth took turns driving
with their hearts in their mouths.
I walked ahead over the 
worst part and slept over
much of the rest.
For vegetation see p. 822.

Carobs and pines only near

There are very large beds
in the W. part of the Hiera-
petra plain. It grows
usually about 10 ft high
and seldom flowers.
Occurrences near Myrtos:
1. Hierapetra plain W. to about
grid 620.
2. Plain E. of the dig hill, near
the sea.
3. Several small stands around
the mouth of the [SYMBOL]
river, the largest at 542002,
on the marine platform be-
tween the Phournon Coryphi
road and the sea ([SYMBOL]6).
4. A single small plant by
the high road, roughly 580608.
It thus occurs in illuv-
839
ial places but not necessarily
plains.
Main uses: (see p. 585)
1. Fences, bound [!!!!]to wires stretched
between posts of odd bits of
wood. Fastenings by fine 1-
stranded ungalvanized steel
wire. Reeds may be used as rails.
2. Huts (p. 575), not common in
S. Crete.
3. Greenhouses for tomatoes.
The frame is made of reeds
tied together with the above wire.
The main members are double
or triple for strength. The glazing
is heavy sheet polythene, now
always tattered and semi-opaque.
4. Awnings for shade.
5. Occasionally in roof plaster and 
semi-permanent structures.

Pistacia and Calycotome
are very infrequent, usually
middle-sized bushes with
no obvious young ones.
Salvia usually occurs
only in the neighbourhood

Carob tree
On the Fornon Chorfi
massif, carobs are largely
confined to ex-arable
and to Type III on the 
saddle (which may have
been cultivated at some
time). Apparently always
in terrace walls in ex-arable.
All carob trees seen
are about 10 in. diam. or
more or growing from the
stumps of such trees.
Several 1- and 2- year
old seedlings were found
under a tree near the
saddle.
843
Pistacia
The larger bushes are
always broadly domed. Grazing
does not seem to have been 
important at least in the last
few years, as most shoots
put on about 6 in. in the 
year. Its failure to grow into
a tree appears to be due to
diageotropism.
The absence [SYMBOL] or rarity of Pistacia dis-
tinguishes former arable from
TYpe II.
Small Pistacia bushes are a 
great rarity.
