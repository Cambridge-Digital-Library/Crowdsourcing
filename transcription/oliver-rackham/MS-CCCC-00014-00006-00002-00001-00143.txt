  The town of Males is rather
indistinct at the edges (like 
Anatoli) where there are various semi-derelict buildings
and tenements.
While walking about these
and examioning a Salvia [????]
[????] ([SYMBOL]297) I was stopped by
a man who asked what I was
doing. I explained that I was a 
[SYMBOL] andn before I could
explain he had snatched away
my knife and collected a whole
armful of this plant, discoursing the
while on its medicinal virtues.
He then led me into a close
containing goats, which had left
little but Mentha ([SYMBOL]296) of which
[10750-10751]
750
he collected another huge bundle.
He then took me to the Marri-
bium ([SYMBOL]295 and did the same.
His wife [????] had been loudly
calling him to supper, and it
was doubtless this rather than
my protests that led him to de-
sist. I had to walk back carrying
these ungainly burdens to the 
astonishment of the people of
Males and got lost in the alleys
to boot.
The [SYMBOL] family were
very kind. A daughter was anxious
to practise English. We dined off
[SYMBOL] made of marrow
flowes stuffed with meat. This
is a 2-storeyed house with
an upstairs balcony and
about 10 rooms, There is a 
garden. It is just outside the
old town.
Vines are grown over the 
house to form a verandah,
and are grown on a small scale
around the village.
[10752-10753]

July 5
[SYMBOL]
A rambling village hanging
on a remendous hillside. Rather 
less crowded than [SYMBOL]. Reached
from [SYMBOL] by a good but
narrow and unpaved road. [SYMBOL]31
Immense olive orchards
clothe the slopes below the 
village but come no higher.
[SYMBOL], a small village
on a flat hill-top, appears quite
derelict apart from the church which
is beautifully kept.
[SYMBOL]
The path ascends steeply
from [SYMBOL]: towards the top
it has several zigzags and a 
flight of steps. It is an excel-
lent mule-track, as broad as a 
narrow road, the only way into
thos fertile valley. It appears
not to have been repaired since
the Turkish period.
One enters the narrow valley
of [SYMBOL] and passes over
a low and hardly perceptible 
saddle into [SYMBOL]. Between
is the rugged ridge of [SYMBOL]
clothed in Quercus coccifera
(p.762f).
THe cultivated areas in [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] is like that in [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL], but with only a few
huts. It is separated from the 
main area of cultivation by
the pine wood of p.764.

The main cultivated area
in [SYMBOL] consists of small
roughly square fields levelled
by terracing on slopes of c. 3 [SYMBOL]
Numerous little stone houses, none
now occupied (they appear to be
lived in earlier in the season).
Chielfly arable, mainly cereals & 
potatoes, now all harvested. Small
amounts of irrigation, some
channels still running, but in
poor repair. Intersected by
numerous complex paths around
the edges of fields. Terraces
with dry-stone walling.
The soil (as in [SYMBOL]) is
yellow, deep in places, evidently
alluvial although the ground 
is by no means flat.

and much vegetation is still 
green.
Persons seen
1. A girl of about 10 who came
up with me from [SYMBOL] and
explained various plants such as
[SYMBOL]* in the lower valley.
She eventually disappeared to
some settlement in [SYMBOL]
2. 2 people working in "[SYMBOL]"
3. The 3 men of [SYMBOL]7 (p. )
who insisted on being photographed,
with two mules carrying fire-
wood (not identified, but not oak)
and dead sheep (of the "alpine"
kind, lightly built, with slender
heads and long ears. Note the 
dog (affable, breed not recognised)
* cf place name "Asferdami"
[10758-10759]
758
4. A solitary gamekeeper-like
man met near th tree-linem who
was surprised to find a stranger
there, and somewhat less forth-
coming
Lazaros us a steep hillside
with scrub and a few pines
below, continuing above the tree
line to bare rolling heights simi-
lar to Dicte and Aphendis Christos.
To the E. are rather abrupt
hills with much wood and scrub
(towards [SYMBOL]).
The [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] range
has a fairly sharp tree-line
at c. 1600m Above this is
bare white limestone with some
vegetation near the summit.
Between [SYMBOL] and
[SYMBOL] is a large cypress
tree c 1ft diam. by the road-
side.
Mystus [SYMBOL] by water courses
Blackstonia [SYMBOL]
Platanus orientalis is abun-
dant by the stream between
M. and X. A large tree with
the habit of the beech but
somewhat tortuous. Very
uneven aged wiht many
[10760-10761]

young trees.
Ivy occurs by this river
on a [????] wall.
The largest plane has an
ivied trunk some 2 1/2 ft dia.
and pendulous branches.

and does not enter the
valley, where pears and
almonds replace it.
The carob does not
come above Males at all.
Oleander is abundant
in lower Selakano to c.
1000m. Vitex does not occur
above [SYMBOL]
[10762-10763]

Kermes Oak
Largest trees c. 3 ft dia.
Annial rings very inconspicuous
One felled [!!!!] 33 in. across
15 rings to 9/16 in.
Another 14 in. c. 120 years.
Young ones occur but not
often. There are many small
bush trees which show signs
of browzing, but even when
they get clear of the goats they
grow very slowly.
Usually an orchard-like
wood of trees c. [????]0 ft high
with clean boles & rounded
crowns. Mainly on limestone
but also volcanic [????]
Understorey varies from
tall closed Calycotome maquis
almost to Coridithyhmus 
garrigue.

The open Kermes woods
begin on the S. side of the
[!!!!][SYMBOL] valley very near
the entrance, at c. 850 m.,
and continue uninterruptedly
on the S. side, and less
continuously on the N., to
the tree line. Never a closed
forest.
[SYMBOL]34 - large spreading tree
near entrance.

[10764-10765]
Pinus Brutia forest on Serpentine
There is an outcrop of
serpentine & associated hae-
matite &c in the middle 
of the Selakano valley. Soils
usually much eroded, but 
some persisting even on steep
slopes. Slopes mostly 20 [SYMBOL]
or more, various aspects,
Quercus coccifera is
mostly absenr. Its place is
taken by P. Brutia forest.
Trees forming an open canopy,
well-grown, up to about
15 in. dia. Many young 
trees & saplings but no
dead trees & few recently 
felled.
Shrubs few and scattered
with large patches of bare
ground.
Herbs very few: a few
thistles and probably scanty
annuals. Many lichens & bryophytes.
Note the remarkable woody tuberous Trifolium
(p. )
This serpentine outcrop
although probably deeply
weathered is not cultivated,
in contrast to the rest of
the Selakano basin whose
soils are either alluvial or
desrived from marls.
Specimen of serpentine

with scattered Kermes.
Morus nigra is grown in
the Salakano valley. The 
fruits are now falling.
Ferula is infrequent in
terrace walls here [SYMBOL]36
Adiantum fringes the
watercourses.
Rhizocarpon occurs on
jasper or haematite in Sala-
kanos.

Kermes Woodland 1080m
On steep slopes of hard
limestone soil between
rendzine and terra rossa, and
like the latter in places, 
very truncated & covering about 
half the surface.

Kermes very uneven in
size. Largest trees c. 30 ft x
c. 3 ft. Many bushes to
3 in. but none apparently
very young. Many are 6-20
ft high and these put in 3-5
in. in a series of presumably
annual flushes. They have
already formed their terminal
buds.
Euphorbia acanthothamnos 329
Largest bushes 6 ft across &
2 ft high. Main stems tortuous,
3 in. diam Most bushes
now shedding their leaves.

Pine Forest
One of the largest trees
23" over bark
50-55 years, very little growth
in last 20
An area of pine wood
mainly on the N. sde of
the valley, on fairly level
ground with a S. aspect.
Trees up to c. 40 ft high,
with the usual habit of
Cretan pines. Uneven - aged
but probably even-aged in
patches. No other trees in
any numbers. Some have
a tendency to pioneer habit.
Undergrowth of grasses with
some large Fumana along
the path. Firest patchy in
771
density but quite dense in 
places.
Much litter but little
humus.
Few stumps.
Few or no lichens. Bark
very rugged, black, staining
black other objects (e.g. trunk
of small maple tree) under-
neath.
No sign of any previous
vegetation being different.
Nonetheless, there is a strong
suggestion that this forest
is of quire recent origin.
Tops of pines not cut off
(unusual in Crete).
Fomes formentarius. On pine
stump.

344 forms rounded
cushions up to 2 ft dia.
and c. 6 in. thick, with
vicious spines from the per-
sistent leaf tips.
345 grass in the protection
of 344.
344 is referred to as the 
"spiny Anthyllis". [Astragulus
creticum]
Above the pine woods, a 
park forest of Quercus coc-
cifera appears. Present 
grazing appears to be much
more severe than anywhere
else seen. Soil confined to 
pockets of rock and illuvial
areas in bottom of vallet &
side valleys.

[10774-10775]
774
Tree Line
Q. coccifera to 1700 m.
Above 1500 m. the trees are
very short and stout & usually
several-trunked. Very
windswept mainly from the 
W.
Most of the shrubs
listed for 1400m. attain the
tree-line.
Pines don not eceed
1400m. at which height
they are very windswept.
Maple sometimes occurs
as a small tree at the
tree-line: to c. 20 ft x 6 in.
Habit like the Kermes but
1-trunked. The maples are
being replaced by means of 
775
grazed bushes making
a leader. Growth of these is
very slow and they are bare
of branches on the W.
This maple, Acer monspes-
sularium, occurs only above
c.1100 m. in this valley.
About 1/10 as frequent as
the oaks, becoming more
abundant near the tree-line.
The other maple, A. orientale,
occurs locally from c. 850 m.
onwards. Near the tree 
line it forms the bulk of 
the grazed-down topiary
bushes but rarely grows
into a tree.

Cypresses in Selakano
At the top of the track
above [SYMBOL]. where it turns
the corner to enter the 
valley, are the only cypresses
seen in the valley. About 
six trees, among rocks on a 
steep S.E. facing shoulder, not 
evidently plated. Varying in
size but none young. The
largest are some 40 ft high
and c. 1 ft dia. Trunks very
zigzag and crooked. Big bran-
ches near the base - some
sawn off at some time in the
past. Foliage in heavy rounded
masses. No obvious leader. 
[10778-10779]
778
Weather in Selakano
Extremely windy from the
N. to N.W. While collecting
Dittany I was bombarded
by small stones blown off
a nearby scree - cf early
accounts of the winds on 
Ida.
All dat clouds hung
over the Dicte-Lazaros
range, and most of the
time over the [SYMBOL] range
also. A cloud wall perhaps
800 ft high stood on the
Dicte range, and continually 
rushed over the edge at high
speed, immediately to dissolve.
A very few drops of rain (quite un-
measurable) got blown over.
Temp. estd at c. 60 [SYMBOL] F.

469109
Cretan Dittany
[SYMBOL]
Quite
frequent
in upper Selakano, but
found flowering only oice,
at c. 1450 m. It occurs
on steep rock outcrops
(c. 70 [SYMBOL] or more) at the
top of screes. Confined to
small crevices in hard lime-
stone. Beautiful leaves with
thick light tomentum like
rabbit's wool. Flowers with
more blue tinge than in [SYMBOL].
By itself the plant has
a short external rhizome and 
several floweing stems. It
appears to be extremely sen-
sitive to goats, and where

[10780-10781]
780
within reach prodduces a few 
tiny leaves and is sterile.
Not apparently particular to
aspect: [SYMBOL] taken on a N.
aspect.
The leaves have a strong
indescribable scent, the most 
beautiful I have ever smelt,
rather like mint but with
a delicate sharp component like
lemon. It is used as tea and
before the war commanded
400 dr. the oke (cheap at the 
price!)
I was directed to this plant
by three very affable ruffianly
characters coming down from the
Dictaean Pass with 2 mules carry-
ing some firewood & dead sheep. 

781
Oak Woodland
The woods in the two areas
- upper valley and on [SYMBOL] -
are now discontinuous, though
the trees in [SYMBOL] suggest
that they were at one time
joined up.
Soil is confined to pockets
of limestone. Rock entirely
white limestone with soil-fillled
grykes and rounded ridges. Nu-
merous projecting rocks, especially
on [SYMBOL] ([SYMBOL]35) and cliff
lines, especially in the upper
valley. Seldom a typical lime-
stone pavement. On steep slopes
the surface is littered with
loose fragments; the cliffs are
rotten and there are consider-
[10782-10783]
782
able cones of fine scree in the
upper valley. Soil brown to yel-
low - not terra rosa. No evidence
of erosion around the bases of 
the oaks.
Tree-like appears to be fairly
sharp; above it on all the
mountains there appears to be
bare white limestone.
No admixture of pines, which
occur only in two small separ-
ate areas (p. 764 & 770).
Single trunks are usual
in the [SYMBOL] wood but multiple
trunts in the upper forest.
Never more than c. 4. This may
result from coppicing but more
likely from grazing when the 
tree was little.
cont. p. 785
783
cont p. 756
Fruit trees almonds & pears
generallt in terrace walls. This
is clearly not the main reason
for the settlement. Vines occa-
sional on houses only. A few
trees of Pyrus armygdaliformis
in Kermes woodland considerably
up the valley have been sought
out and grafted.
Kermes oaks grow around
houses, mainly around the edge
of the cultivated area. They
include [!!!!]some of the[!!!!] the largest seen in the
island, some 50 ft high, in habit
very like Q. ILex.
Poultry are kept at some
times around the houses.
Further up the [SYMBOL]
valley, limestone rocks appear
[10784-10785]
784
and there is a gradual trans-
ition to limestone pavement;
cultivation is restricted to illuvial
hollows and then disappears.
Arable is partly abandoned in
the upper parts of the settlement.
The scrubby Euphorbia
acanthothamnos woodland of p.
766 is on an island of rocks.
Numerous interesting weeds
in the cultivated lands, cf [SYMBOL]309(2)
-330. Spiny plants such as Cen-
taurea idaea ([SYMBOL]4) and Cichorium
spinosum ([SYMBOL]5) are particularly
chracteristic of the abandoned
arable in the upper cultivated
area.
Flowering times are con-
siderably later than on the coast
cont. p. 757
785
cont. p. 782
Felling exceptionally rare and
trees thus difficult to age (p. 762).
Possible pollarding near culti-
vation ([!!!!][SYMBOL]18) but this is un-
usual. Enormous worm holes
in exposed wood.
Grazing is still very severe,
possibly more so in the past [!!!!]
(young trees but no young-mid-
dle-aged). A flock of about 50
goats was seen. Two immense
billies with fine horns making
several turns were seen
fighting near the ruins of a 
hut. This is the only place
where goats were seen at large
in Crete. Unattended. Sheep are
said in Myrtos to collect in [SYMBOL]
tcavo in large numbers at cer-
[10786-10787]
876
tain seasons but no sign of 
this was seen and the informa-
tion may be out of date.
Igelheide (with very antipastoral
plants, like spiny Anthyllis) was
found only in teh bottom of the 
dry valley near the goats.
Damage to oaks by wind
([SYMBOL]10) is infrequent.
Regeneration ([SYMBOL]14) of both
oaks and maples is by forming
a "box hedge" which inches its
way up under continual grazing 
until eventually it gets out of
reach. This happens in the upper
but not the lower woods, p. 784f.
Oaks always spiny, but
sometimes less spiny than at
others ([SYMBOL]358).
787
Conclusions
The oak forest is probably
relict native [SYMBOL] primary vegetationn. The
present trees were probably 
established in Venetian or By-
zantine times and have 
survived through a period of 
more intense grazing. It is 
too sparse to permit fire (the
crowns of trees seldom touch).
It at present contains
rather few associated [SYMBOL] tree spp. (e.g.
Acer spp., possibly Pyrus). Cypress
might be a natural associate
selectively removed: there are 
rumours of "cedars" elsewhere 
in the Dictaean range. The
Q. Ilex apparently seen by
Tournefort is a problem: despite

[10788-10789]
788
searching none was found.
No evidence of substantial
erosion in the lifetime of the 
present trees.
Despite remoteness the ab-
sence of logging is very remark-
able.
The settlement is very dif-
ficult to date. Tournefort would
be expected to mention it but
does not. No evidence of an-
tiquity; but the terrace walls
and vegetation are well estab-
lished, and some areas have 
gone out of cultivation. The mud
road appears to be old, but
it is a strategic route and
could be older than the settle-
ment.
789
Pine woods are difficult
to interpret because the trees
are fast-growing and short-lived.
Possibly it is the native
tree on S. facing slopes and
special soils, e.g. serpentine.
Oaks around the settlement
could be relicts.
The variety of vegetation 
under oaks is remarkable
(but cf E. Anglian woods!) and 
shows that many heathland
types in Crete [!!!!] could be degraded
woodland.
