January 23. [DIAG]
Hayley Wood [DIAG]
(preparation for a
levelling survey, with Dr Perrin).
In the N.W. corner is
a small elm grove with
about 15 rather scattered
trees and many suckers.
The pond is now quite
full after recent rains.
Near the pond is a coppice
oak with 2 big stems. Two
more oaks [????] in the W.
section and one in the E.
section as on the map,
the estimated diameters
being given.
There appears to be no
flow of water across the N.W.
ride.

[8650-8651]

[DIAG]

[8652-8653]

To the S. of this ride there
appears to be a slight rise
in the N.W. part and [!!!!]
level ground in the S.E. part,
whence perhaps the mercury
distribution.
The S. section apparently
drains through[!!!!] its bank
only at the S.W. corner
where there is a gap. There
is, however, a definite flow
in the ditch along the S.W.
ride, which mysteriously be-
comes weaker towards the
edge of the Wood and ap-
pears to vanish, whereas the
flow in the other ditch of
this ride is continuous.
An 8in. glazed pipe is
under the mouth of the
small ride leading S. from
the central clearing at the
point where it crosses the
ring ditch.
Much of the flow
down Hayley Ditch in the
E. section is led under the
S.E. ride by a piped culvert
which still flows. There is
no sign of flow in the ride
ditches. This is the source of
much of the water in the
triangle between the Ditch
and the S.E. ride.
The swamp terminates
eastwards in a slight
rise of the ground.
There is considerable
standing water in the W.
section and the N. half of

[8654-8655]

the e. section, but little on
the S. slope.
A linear hollow 200
yards long, magnetic bearing
269[SYMBOL], was discovered in the
E. section. It is now full of
water. It crosses Hayley Ditch
without changing aligment.
There is apparently no bank
to correspond. It ends some-
what abruptly a few yards
S.[!!!!]W. of the S.[!!!!] corner of the
1967 plot.
A patch of Carex riparia
a few yards across was
found in the E. section as
shown on the map.
Callitriche still flourishes
on the N.E. ride.
Michael Martin's hollow
contains about 1ft of water.
January 24.
Clematis buds are starting
growth.
January 25.
The last flower of the
Aloe [!!!!]opened.
January 26.
In the dry weather,
static electricity is most
marked. Visible sparks, and
even electric shocks to the
tongue, can be got from an
ordinary hair comb.
January 27.
The dawn-chorus of
birds is noticeable.
January 28.
[!!!!] Hazel and Salix
caprea are flowering in the Hard-

[8656-8657]

wick area.
[!!!!] Mitchell's Wood, Caldecote.
This wood is entirely
elm, save a few large maples
and one very large poplar.
Elms rather tall and narrow,
as in Overhall; rather uneven
aged, but few very large.
Suckers few. Old trees mainly
N. of the Wedgwood Farm
entrance. In the S.E. corner
an area of small dense
elms. No oaks.
Little shrub layer. Few
hazels or hawthorns. No sign
of coppicing.
The wood is grazed
and electric-fenced. Some
of the smaller elms are
barked up to 5ft from
[DIAG]

[8658-8659]

the ground.
Ivy covers about 1/4 of
the ground and often climbs
trees.
Anthriscus and nettles
are the most obvious herbs,
neither very dense. No sign
of mercury, bluebells, or
oxlips.
The moat is shallow
and constitutes the only open
water.
The S. part of the belt
in front of the wood is
bramble and thorn scrub,
with patches of grassland.
Chamaenerion frequent. Dog-
wood loc. ab.
The N. part of this belt is
partly elms suckered from in-
side, partly ash. Ivy and
Anthriscus on ground.
Stinnage's Wood, Caldecote.
[DIAG]
Not entered, but seen
close to at the N.W. corner.
Ground level, no sign

[8660-8661]

of standing water.
Oak and elm dominant.
Some oaks very large: tall,
narrow, well-grown. Elms of
various sizes, with many
small ones coming up through
the oak.
Ash frequent as standards.
Understorey elder, hawthorn,
ash, maple: mainly 1-stemmed,
no sign of coppice. Hawthorn
hedge round outside. No
dense bushes anywhere:
the wood can be seen
through N.-S. and W.-E.
Little ivy on ground,
much on trees, especially
big elms.
Ground very clear, but
some Anthriscus.
The wood-closes are
level grassland, not obviously
ridged.
Whitepits Plantation, Dry Drayton.
[DIAG]
Oak dominant: tall narrow
trees rather close-set and
perhaps in irregular rows. A

[8662-8663]

few fallen in the N. part.
Beech frequent: one
large tree in middle.
Maple few, in N. only.
Ash and hawthorn absent.
Hazel abundant but not
coppiced.
Ivy abundant on ground
and trees.
Birch occasional.
Privet scarce.
Brachypodium sylvaticum.
Daphne laureola: a few
plants.
Madingley Wood.
New shoots of dog's mer-
cury are well above the
ground.
There are two large dit-
ches running downhill from
the great earthwork, about
6ft wide and up to 3ft
deep, with the earth forming
a bank on either side.
Coppice with standards
occupies the whole of the
old wood (sec. 6), except
for a small area without
standards and some mar-
ginal scrub. The coppice is
entirely hazel except for
the maples which have
probably been done a long
time ago. A few standard
ashes occur. Similar cop-
pice with standards occurs
inside teh E. part of the
earthwork.

[8664-8665]

January
[!!!!]August[!!!!] 29.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).
Oxlips are just visible.
Bluebells are well above
the surface.
Stellaria holostea (abun-
dant in the elm grove).
winters as short leafy
shoots with full-sized leaves.
Mercury is well ad-
vanced and flower buds
can be seen.
Hazel and poplar are
flowering.
Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus
was found in some quantity
under the large widely-
spaced ash stools in the
W. part of the E. section, with
Plagiochila and [????] undulat[????]
[DIAG]
Two birches occur in
the E. section.
An elm [!!!!]o[!!!!]in the E. section
has in the past appar-
ently been coppiced on a
high stool like an ash.
A patch of Carex rip-
aria was discovered as
shown. In a slight hollow
(without standing water) in a

[8668-8669]

rather open part of the
wood. No poplar. Carex
riparia dominant over a few
square yards. With:
Prunus spinosa
Deschampsia
Spiraea
Thuidium
Ficaria
Rubus caesius
Maple. Large single stool
tree, cut through stool and
section (mean diam. 16 in.)
removed.
Preliminary analysis shows
very slow growth 191[!!!!]-,
widening after 1926 and
remaining rapid. Growth
is fairly fast before 191[!!!!],
but slow 1893-7. No rings
available before 1885 because
section is hollow; inside
[!!!!]filled[!!!!] lined with a cheesey
dark brown substance with a
well-defined boundary following
roughly the 1885 ring.
[DIAG]

[8670-8671]

Ash, 38"ft", mean diam.
11 in. Coppiced on a low
stool. Crown weak.
Preliminary analysis: First
available ring 1789 (middle
[!!!!]hollow, surrounded by a black
zone plate, with a firm
brown rot surrounding up to
c. 1850, with many zone
lines). Estimated beginning
1775. Rings decrease until
1815 and then remain very
constant (c.35 to the in.)
with the following wider years:
1835-7, 1854-8, 1865, 1897,
1909, 1926-9.
January 30.
The last flower of the
Aloe at Leckhampton closed.
January 31.
The small potted Laburnum
at Leckhampton continues
to have small green leaves.
February 1.
The weather is now anti-
cyclonic of a very warm
clear type.
February 2.
A pit dug to 6ft deep
halfway down the Leck-
hampton loke shows sand
and gravel right the way
down.
February 3.
Crocus toma[????]sinianus is
flowering in Cambridge.
February 4.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).
There is no open
water visible in the E. part

[8672-8673]

of the Triangle, though some
of the hollows are slightly
damp.
Lepidozia has flourished
greatly during the winter
and is probably now in-
creased.
Sedum Telephium grew
tall last year but did
not flower. It has much
more light from the N.
as a result of coppicing
the adjacent plot. No sign
of this year's shoots.
One of the bonfires
was lit from the still-hot
ashes from last week.
Ash. 4 3/4 in., from stool.
1912, 1912-4 fast; '15-'22
medium; '22-'29 fast; '30-9
medium; '40- '59 slow; '60-
very slow.
Another from the same
stool 5 1/2", also 1912.
Ash. One only from stool.
11 1/2 in. 1905 [SYMBOL]3.
Hawthorn tops were
nailed over a number of
ash stools as protection
from deer.
February 5.
Longstowe.
Home Wood.
S.E. section. Oaks few.
Some very large stumps
felled in recent years, but

[8674-8675]

occasional big ones and
more smaller ones standing.
No coppice trees seen.
Ash few, probably maiden;
stools very few, large, not more
than 1ft high.
Maple none.
Hazel adundant, but
small, apparently never cop-
piced.
Privet occurs.
Surface very uneven, with
many surface pools (one
regular pond shown on map)
and black holes. Oxlip blue-
bell, mercury all visible; O.
mainly in the middle, B.
in the E., M. in the W., but
zones perhaps less definite
than in Hayley.
Rubus caesius sometimes
dominant.
Elm occurs throughout
this area, and is dominant
after the removal of the
big oaks. Uneven-aged,
fairly tall and narrow,
showing no sign of shading
out the oaks. Some old
stools but no regular
coppicing; it coppices freely
in gaps which were made
to allow felling the big
oaks.
Ajuga abundant, sometimes
dominant.
Deschampsia [!!!!]y be dom-
inant in swamp areas.
Thuidium tamariscinum

in.
The wide E.-W. ride
is very overgrown.
There is much surface
water in both the E. sec-
tions. The rides are not
ditched, though a ditched
ride apparently used to
run across the N.E. section.
N.E. section.
No obvious differences,
but oxlip probably less
abundant.
N.W. section.
Mainly the same as the
S.E. section but drier. One
plant of Carex pendula.
Several birches. To the S.
of the extinct cross ride
is an area of very tall al-
most pure elm.
S.W. section. Much of this
is oak and ash with little
elm. Cirsium palustre grows
8ft high in a clearing.
Probably better drained than
the S.E. Section.
Park. A number of ornamen-
tal lakes and islands
formed c.1900 by damming
a stream (though there
were fish-ponds before).
Several plants of Carex
[!!!!]pendula at the S.W. corner
of the main bridge in front
of the house, 307557, perhaps
planted.
Many conifers are
planted in the park

[8680-8681]

and other woods, though
none in the Home Wood. They
do reasonably well, espe-
cially spruce.
Gas-house Spinney.
[!!!!] Entirely elm (save
one oak). Large, tall, fairly
dense, uneven-aged.
Ground flora uniform:
nettles v. ab. throughout,
Glechoma, mercury, Arum,
bluebells occasional. Galium
aparine at the top of the
wood.
The p[!!!!]ttern of ditches
is curious. The transverse
ditch is small and wet.
The N.-S. and E.-W.
ditches have large banks
[DIAG]
on their uphill sides forming
a kind of plateau (cf Els-
worth). The latter ditch is very
deep and wet.
The area adjoining to
the W. is treeless, with Phrag-
mites almost pure, occasional
pools of open water.

[8682-8683]

[DIAG]
Church Spinney.
Recent (ridge & furrow
in a large area).
A belt of giant tall
elms grows along the W.
side, but elm is otherwise
limited to occasional suckers.
Main trees: Ash, young oak,
larch, with occasional syca-
more, yew, and Salix fragilis.
In the W. part is a
nitrophilous area with elder,
nettels, Arctium, mercury.
The rest of the wood has
Symphoricarpos thickets, Glech-
oma, and less vigorous nettles;
also a carpet of Eurhynch-
ium praelongum.
No sign of coppice.
February 6.
Violets are flowering in
Leckhampton.
February 7.
The weather continues
mild, with clear days and
nights but only slight
frost.

[8684-8685]

February 8.
Eranthis is already over.
February 9.
The Clematis internodes
are elongating.
February 10.
Yellow crocuses are flow-
ering.
February 11.
A climbing rose on the
wall of the Master's garden
in Botolph Lane has one
living flower.
February 12. Hayley (coppicing).
A fresh mole [????] was
found in the N. section
although there is much
flooding nearby.
Bluebells now up to 4in.
high. A few [????] visible.
Mercury: many [????]
visible, some almost open.
Primula: about 2 in. high,
infl. visible. Uniform over
the whole wood.
The coppicing was almost
finished (apart from a dozen
or so trees near the S.E.
side of the plot). A bonfire
about 12ft diam. of large
and small wood (including
crooked poles up to 4 in.
diam.) was lit in the
recording plot centred on
one of the marker stakes.
Several photographs were
taken of its progress.
Deer have been seen
recently. Their footmarks were

[8686-8687]

found in several places, some
very fresh. They have taken
to using a crossing near the
end of the S.E. ride.
The distribution of big[!!!!]
ash stools is very patchy.
They are absent from much
of the N. section, though
frequent elsewhere in it. They
are scarce under the elms,
but a few occur, though
not particularly debilitated.
Mr Cox has removed
the derelict cart and
other equipment which
had been dumped near the
N.W. entrance, uprooting a
few hawthorns in so doing.
A flimsy fence of gas-pipe
and wire has been put up
along the edge of the concrete
road constucted by him.
Peter Moule identified a
rather fresh badger footmark
in the S.E. ride.
Iris foetidissima could not
be found in the S. section (it
is said to occur in the E.
triangle thereof).
The bank on the S. side
of the newly-discovered ditch
in the E. section appears
to be too slight to be
marked by any absolute
floristic differences, though
there could be a higher
proportion of bluebells on it.
It passes S. of M. Martin's
"black hole".
About a dozen of the

[8688-8689]

[DIAG]
ash stools in the coppice
plot have been protected by
nailing thorn tops over
them.
The crab-tree in the
1967 plot has emerged
from the coppicing al-
most undamaged,
despite having a
heavy maple tree
carelessly felled onto
it. It is probably
of great age and
the three trunks are
apparently the remains
of a large completely
decayed stool.
Anthriscus is in
flower at Bourne
(one plant).

[8690-8691]

February 13.
Large mosquito-like
insects are common.
February 14.
In Burrell's Walk, snow-
drops are well out and
aconites over.
February 15.
The Garrya in the New
Court is most flourishing
and now flowering (male).
February 16.
About 2 sq. yards of
dry rot were found on
I staircase - under the
offset plaster on an inter-
nal brick wall on the
ground floor just to the
right as one comes in.
A thick white mycelial felt.
Attack on woodwork is
very limited and sharply
defined.
February 17.
The weather is now colder
and less stable.
February 18.
Hardwick Wood (bryophyte
excursion and pH measurements)
At the far N. end
there is very patchy
woodland with big pion-
eer oaks and an
area of Ulmus glabra.
There are some large
patches of almost open
ground. No sign of ridge
& furrow.
A. Open, oak litt[????], little

Atrichum is abundant in
these areas with little ground
cover and hardly any shade.
Gorse formerly occurred
in this part of the Wood.
5 dead bushes seen, rather
over-mature and very strag-
gly. Search among brambles
would probably reveal more.
C. Under gorse bush.
1" pH 4.8 (!)
3" pH 5.0
Cirriphyllum crassinervium
occurs in considerable quantity
on the compact earth of the
W. bank. 2
Aulacomnium androgy-
num is on a big oak
(marked X) near its base,
and on several stumps under
dense scrub.
Corresponding probably
to the post-1922 woodland
is an area of penetrable
and over-mature scrub.
Birch dom.
Crataegus monogyna forming
the main understorey. Big
bushes now toppling over
and lying about in confusion.
Prunus spinosa frequent, as
above.
Ash: few emergents.
Salix caprea: few.

[8698-8699]

Fissidens exilis was found
in this area.
Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus
occurs in small quantity in
moderate shade of scrub
with very luxuriant Thuidium
tamariscinum (the latter
characteristic of all the new
wood).
Dicranoweissia cirrata was
found on a big old ash
stool in the E. hedge.
Primroses occur on the E.
bank.
The new wood, at any
rate S. of the "1922" scrub, was
formerly planted with coni-
fers, of which the stumps
remain some 6 in. diam.
Only a larch survives.
The S.E. part of the
new wood is quite open,
with scattered trees mainly
Ulmus glabra, with no
tendency to dense sucker-
ing. Brachypodium sylva-
ticum dominates the ground
flora.
The part of the old
wood N. of the main ride
consists [!!!!] almost entirely
of very big dense stout
hazel coppice. The oaks
have all been felled. The
stumps are fresher than
most of those in Hayley
and many carry Daedalea
quercina. One coppice tree
was found with 5 large
flourishing trunks (to c.

[8700-8701]

5in. diam. and overtopping
the coppice). Big coppice
maples are quite frequent.
Ulmus glabra occasional.
No hawthorn. Ivy on
ground (as elsewhere in
the old wood); occasion-
ally the tree form on
hazel. Ground flora poor.
In the region of the
pond, the standard oaks
remain. Tall, rather dense
and narrow. Elm [!!!!]
rare (patch of suckers by
the E. end of the main ride).
Coppice poorer; maples
scarce; ash does not occur.
Hawthorn frequent, small,
apparently all C. monogyna
(C. oxyacanthoides was not
seen anywhere in the wood).
The water in the pond
is about 2ft below the
level of the surrounding
land (which does not ap-
pear embanked), and at
least 2ft deep.
D. Level ground, bluebell-mer-
cury, with ivy. Earthworms
present.

The S. part of the Plan-
tation has coppice in rows
with scattered elm; this
does not occur in the

[8702-8703]

older N. part of it.
Metzgeria occurs on
a big ash (one of the few
in the wood) here.
E. The Plantation. Ivy, [????]nium
undulatum.
1" pH 7.4
Nothing was seen of
Allium ursinum.
Near the N. end of the
Plantation is a Cornus tree
with a single stem c.3 in.
diam. and c.15ft high.
Hazel flowers are
getting over.
No sign was seen of any
transverse markings of
ring[????] in the Old Wood.
The boulder clay in
the fields along the N.W.
[DIAG]

[8704-8705]

footpath to the Wood
is lighter and more sandy
than in the Hayley area.
The Plantation shows no
ridge & furrow in either part.
February 19.
Swansley Wood (with
Peter Moule).
Mercury is abundant
on the banks of the deep
ditch of the road oposite
Madingley Wood.
Knapwell Plantation (S.
of the A45) is a belt mainly
of elms with much ivy
on the floor. No bluebells or
mercury.
Swansley Wood (about
1/3 of the original area is left)
is almost dead level but
slopes slightly in the S.
half towards Swansley Farm.
Surrounded by a formidable
bank and ditch on the
outside (total height some
6ft, slightly lower on the S.
side); bank and ditch on
the inside slighter, though
ditch [!!!!] [!!!!]t A (where
the field seems to have
been encroached on by
elms) contains about
2ft of water. Internal
ditches wide and shallow
like those in Hayley.
Surface water very
abundant in the N. half.
Large areas completely
flooded (perhaps 1/4 of the

[8706-8707]

[DIAG

[8708-8709]

[DIAG]

[8710-8711]

total). "Black holes" less
distinct than at Hayley,
but perhaps concealed by
the general flooding.
Oak. Entirely felled.
Stumps about as rotten
as the average in Hayley.
No fallen logs or branches.
Coppice trees thus:
[SYMBOL]1 Single, small, old.
[SYMBOL]2 Group of 4, with 2,5,2,2
trunks respectively.
[SYMBOL]3 Large double. [SYMBOL]8. 3 trunks.
[SYMBOL]4 Single.
[SYMBOL]5 Single.
[SYMBOL]6 4 trunks.
[SYMBOL]7 4 trunks.
Density must originally
have been less than Hayley.
Ash. Dominant tree. Entirely
coppiced, mainly on big
old stools much as in Hay-
ley, though the stools are
seldom so high and
may be as low as 9 in.
Stools old and hollow,
sometimes grown apart into
segments, never unusually
large. Poles much the
same size as in the wetter
parts of Hayley.
Elm. The elm area is
copied off the 1962 aerial
photograph in the County
Planning Office. It has
all been coppiced. Tall,
narrow, dense. The elm
area has no oak, little

[8712-8713]

ash (and that mostly not
on high stools); hazel local,
poor; maple rare; hawthorn
scarce. The elm area
shows no sign of expan-
ding. It is presumably
responsible for the ditch
[????] not being the present
boundary.
Maple. Coppiced, scarce.
Hazel. Abundant, in much
the same state as in Hay-
ley. Absent from large areas
particularly in the S.E.
Hawthorn. Abundant. C. mono-
gyna is much the commone[????]
hybrids are frequent and
apparently pure C. oxyacanth-
oides rare.
Prunus spinosa. Abundant,
particularly in the areas
shown on the map.
Populus tremula. Rare, except
in a small area shown on
the map where it is abun-
dant.
Elder. Particularly abundant
in the area shown on the
map; frequent throughout
the nettle area.
Crab. At B is a very large
maiden tree, 34 1/2 in. round;
trunk like that of a

[8714-8715]

cultivated apple but furrowed.
Oxlip. Very abundant but
seldom dominant. Large
plants, rather widely spaced
despite the open canopy.
One was found in flower
at C; two flowers out.
Bluebell. Extremely abundant,
though seldom in high
density; almost never tot-
ally absent. Shoots usually
medium-sized. Frequently
growing half-submerged.
Mercury. Very locally adun-
dant; absent from much
of the wood.
Stinging-nettle. Dominant over
a considerable area, with
eledr and Prunus spinosa.
This part of the wood
is rather open and is
at present much roosted
in by birds.
Privet. Scarce. Large bush at D.

Comparison with Hayley.
The most Hayley-like of these
woods, though more disturbed
and devastated.
1. Even more surface water,
though this may be a
result of the big boundary
bank.
2. Zones 3 & 4 predominate
instead of 2 & 6. This may
be because waterlogging,
though intense enough to
exclude mercury, does not
last long-enough to exclude
blubell.
"phosphato-

philous" area.
4. Much less Filipendula.
