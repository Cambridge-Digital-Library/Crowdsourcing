[8649]

January 23. [DIAG]
Hayley Wood [DIAG]
(preparation for a
levelling survey, with Dr Perrin).
In the N.W. corner is
a small elm grove with
about 15 rather scattered
trees and many suckers.
The pond is now quite
full after recent rains.
Near the pond is a coppice
oak with 2 big stems. Two
more oaks [????] in the W.
section and one in the E.
section as on the map,
the estimated diameters
being given.
There appears to be no
flow of water across the N.W.
ride.

[8650-8651]

[DIAG]

[8652-8653]

To the S. of this ride there
appears to be a slight rise
in the N.W. part and [!!!!]
level ground in the S.E. part,
whence perhaps the mercury
distribution.
The S. section apparently
drains through[!!!!] its bank
only at the S.W. corner
where there is a gap. There
is, however, a definite flow
in the ditch along the S.W.
ride, which mysteriously be-
comes weaker towards the
edge of the Wood and ap-
pears to vanish, whereas the
flow in the other ditch of
this ride is continuous.
An 8in. glazed pipe is
under the mouth of the
small ride leading S. from
the central clearing at the
point where it crosses the
ring ditch.
Much of the flow
down Hayley Ditch in the
E. section is led under the
S.E. ride by a piped culvert
which still flows. There is
no sign of flow in the ride
ditches. This is the source of
much of the water in the
triangle between the Ditch
and the S.E. ride.
The swamp terminates
eastwards in a slight
rise of the ground.
There is considerable
standing water in the W.
section and the N. half of

[8654-8655]

the e. section, but little on
the S. slope.
A linear hollow 200
yards long, magnetic bearing
269[SYMBOL], was discovered in the
E. section. It is now full of
water. It crosses Hayley Ditch
without changing aligment.
There is apparently no bank
to correspond. It ends some-
what abruptly a few yards
S.[!!!!]W. of the S.[!!!!] corner of the
1967 plot.
A patch of Carex riparia
a few yards across was
found in the E. section as
shown on the map.
Callitriche still flourishes
on the N.E. ride.
Michael Martin's hollow
contains about 1ft of water.
January 24.
Clematis buds are starting
growth.
January 25.
The last flower of the
Aloe [!!!!]opened.
January 26.
In the dry weather,
static electricity is most
marked. Visible sparks, and
even electric shocks to the
tongue, can be got from an
ordinary hair comb.
January 27.
The dawn-chorus of
birds is noticeable.
January 28.
[!!!!] Hazel and Salix
caprea are flowering in the Hard-

[8656-8657]

wick area.
[!!!!] Mitchell's Wood, Caldecote.
This wood is entirely
elm, save a few large maples
and one very large poplar.
Elms rather tall and narrow,
as in Overhall; rather uneven
aged, but few very large.
Suckers few. Old trees mainly
N. of the Wedgwood Farm
entrance. In the S.E. corner
an area of small dense
elms. No oaks.
Little shrub layer. Few
hazels or hawthorns. No sign
of coppicing.
The wood is grazed
and electric-fenced. Some
of the smaller elms are
barked up to 5ft from
[DIAG]

[8658-8659]

the ground.
Ivy covers about 1/4 of
the ground and often climbs
trees.
Anthriscus and nettles
are the most obvious herbs,
neither very dense. No sign
of mercury, bluebells, or
oxlips.
The moat is shallow
and constitutes the only open
water.
The S. part of the belt
in front of the wood is
bramble and thorn scrub,
with patches of grassland.
Chamaenerion frequent. Dog-
wood loc. ab.
The N. part of this belt is
partly elms suckered from in-
side, partly ash. Ivy and
Anthriscus on ground.
Stinnage's Wood, Caldecote.
[DIAG]
Not entered, but seen
close to at the N.W. corner.
Ground level, no sign

[8660-8661]

of standing water.
Oak and elm dominant.
Some oaks very large: tall,
narrow, well-grown. Elms of
various sizes, with many
small ones coming up through
the oak.
Ash frequent as standards.
Understorey elder, hawthorn,
ash, maple: mainly 1-stemmed,
no sign of coppice. Hawthorn
hedge round outside. No
dense bushes anywhere:
the wood can be seen
through N.-S. and W.-E.
Little ivy on ground,
much on trees, especially
big elms.
Ground very clear, but
some Anthriscus.
The wood-closes are
level grassland, not obviously
ridged.
Whitepits Plantation, Dry Drayton.
[DIAG]
Oak dominant: tall narrow
trees rather close-set and
perhaps in irregular rows. A

[8662-8663]

few fallen in the N. part.
Beech frequent: one
large tree in middle.
Maple few, in N. only.
Ash and hawthorn absent.
Hazel abundant but not
coppiced.
Ivy abundant on ground
and trees.
Birch occasional.
Privet scarce.
Brachypodium sylvaticum.
Daphne laureola: a few
plants.
Madingley Wood.
New shoots of dog's mer-
cury are well above the
ground.
There are two large dit-
ches running downhill from
the great earthwork, about
6ft wide and up to 3ft
deep, with the earth forming
a bank on either side.
Coppice with standards
occupies the whole of the
old wood (sec. 6), except
for a small area without
standards and some mar-
ginal scrub. The coppice is
entirely hazel except for
the maples which have
probably been done a long
time ago. A few standard
ashes occur. Similar cop-
pice with standards occurs
inside teh E. part of the
earthwork.

[8664-8665]

January
[!!!!]August[!!!!] 29.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).
Oxlips are just visible.
Bluebells are well above
the surface.
Stellaria holostea (abun-
dant in the elm grove).
winters as short leafy
shoots with full-sized leaves.
Mercury is well ad-
vanced and flower buds
can be seen.
Hazel and poplar are
flowering.
Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus
was found in some quantity
under the large widely-
spaced ash stools in the
W. part of the E. section, with
Plagiochila and [????] undulat[????]
[DIAG]
Two birches occur in
the E. section.
An elm [!!!!]o[!!!!]in the E. section
has in the past appar-
ently been coppiced on a
high stool like an ash.
A patch of Carex rip-
aria was discovered as
shown. In a slight hollow
(without standing water) in a

[8668-8669]

rather open part of the
wood. No poplar. Carex
riparia dominant over a few
square yards. With:
Prunus spinosa
Deschampsia
Spiraea
Thuidium
Ficaria
Rubus caesius
Maple. Large single stool
tree, cut through stool and
section (mean diam. 16 in.)
removed.
Preliminary analysis shows
very slow growth 191[!!!!]-,
widening after 1926 and
remaining rapid. Growth
is fairly fast before 191[!!!!],
but slow 1893-7. No rings
available before 1885 because
section is hollow; inside
[!!!!]filled[!!!!] lined with a cheesey
dark brown substance with a
well-defined boundary following
roughly the 1885 ring.
[DIAG]

[8670-8671]

Ash, 38"ft", mean diam.
11 in. Coppiced on a low
stool. Crown weak.
Preliminary analysis: First
available ring 1789 (middle
[!!!!]hollow, surrounded by a black
zone plate, with a firm
brown rot surrounding up to
c. 1850, with many zone
lines). Estimated beginning
1775. Rings decrease until
1815 and then remain very
constant (c.35 to the in.)
with the following wider years:
1835-7, 1854-8, 1865, 1897,
1909, 1926-9.
January 30.
The last flower of the
Aloe at Leckhampton closed.
January 31.
The small potted Laburnum
at Leckhampton continues
to have small green leaves.
February 1.
The weather is now anti-
cyclonic of a very warm
clear type.
February 2.
A pit dug to 6ft deep
halfway down the Leck-
hampton loke shows sand
and gravel right the way
down.
February 3.
Crocus toma[????]sinianus is
flowering in Cambridge.
February 4.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).
There is no open
water visible in the E. part

[8672-8673]

of the Triangle, though some
of the hollows are slightly
damp.
Lepidozia has flourished
greatly during the winter
and is probably now in-
creased.
Sedum Telephium grew
tall last year but did
not flower. It has much
more light from the N.
as a result of coppicing
the adjacent plot. No sign
of this year's shoots.
One of the bonfires
was lit from the still-hot
ashes from last week.
Ash. 4 3/4 in., from stool.
1912, 1912-4 fast; '15-'22
medium; '22-'29 fast; '30-9
medium; '40- '59 slow; '60-
very slow.
Another from the same
stool 5 1/2", also 1912.
Ash. One only from stool.
11 1/2 in. 1905 [SYMBOL]3.
Hawthorn tops were
nailed over a number of
ash stools as protection
from deer.
February 5.
Longstowe.
Home Wood.
S.E. section. Oaks few.
Some very large stumps
felled in recent years, but

[8674-8675]

occasional big ones and
more smaller ones standing.
No coppice trees seen.
Ash few, probably maiden;
stools very few, large, not more
than 1ft high.
Maple none.
Hazel adundant, but
small, apparently never cop-
piced.
Privet occurs.
Surface very uneven, with
many surface pools (one
regular pond shown on map)
and black holes. Oxlip blue-
bell, mercury all visible; O.
mainly in the middle, B.
in the E., M. in the W., but
zones perhaps less definite
than in Hayley.
Rubus caesius sometimes
dominant.
Elm occurs throughout
this area, and is dominant
after the removal of the
big oaks. Uneven-aged,
fairly tall and narrow,
showing no sign of shading
out the oaks. Some old
stools but no regular
coppicing; it coppices freely
in gaps which were made
to allow felling the big
oaks.
Ajuga abundant, sometimes
dominant.
Deschampsia [!!!!]y be dom-
inant in swamp areas.
Thuidium tamariscinum
ab.
