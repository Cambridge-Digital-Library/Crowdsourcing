Ug v. common in Maryculter, prob.
planted - DED uncertain.
and frequent in hedges and along
rivers up to the entrance of Glen Tamar.
   Occasional wych-elm avenues 
up to country-houses.
3877
Dee up to Banchory.
  Mainly agricutural; arable &
pasture about equal. Mostly stone-
wall country, but many hedges, &
hedgerow trees many.
  Most houses appear to be 19th-cent.,
one 18th-cent. seen.
  No native woodland; even Funach
Wood is thoroughly coniferized.

Bridge of Feugh. Fine bridge if 2 great
arches in medieval tradition. Cutwaters are 
1/2-octagons.

Strath Feugh. More definitely highland,
with less arable.
  Belts of Collonach - mainly
oaks & other decid. trees.
 Water o'Feugh at ford 653920. A
[23978-23979]
3978
clear brown stream, slightly frothy.
Fringed by alders (here only along the
main rivers & streams). [Douglasin]
  An American Spiraea (not sali-
cifolia) forms thickets near the ford.
Valley is mainly improved grass-
land with some arable. Moors close
in on the adjoining mountains.
  Great beeches on the way up to 
the pass over Corsedarder Hill.
  Corsedarder Hill is a tract of
brackeny moorland. Much birchwood
near road, prob. recent, more exten-
sive than shown on the O.S. 1".

Burning. All the higher hills are oatched
with areas of dufferent ages of regrowth,
exceot Glen Tanar.
3979

Quite warm for the time of year.

KINCARDNINESHIRE (Tilbruries).

lated house of medieval origin.
Park contains many great elms and
beeches but no very old trees.

Dinner. Above Aboyne the valley is
[23980-23981]
3980
full of birchwoods - much more 
than shown on the O.S.

Potarch Inn, Birse. 607973
  Here is a small common, said
to be an overnight stance for drovers
using the main N.-S. road over 
Cairn's Mount.

Robin Callander says that al-
most all the commons in Scotland
were privatized in the 17th & 18th 
cent. This one now has, ironically,
a sign "No Overnight Parking".
Much birchwood since the O.S. on
the heather moors from here to
the S.E. (Muckle Ord).

Fingan Mill.
Sawmill with circular saw.
Kiln room - old Aberdeen trailer
voiler.
Sawmill - breastshot
electicity -[???? ting]overshot wheel
Turnery - undershot.

     Three adjacent mills.
  Sawmill is of a conventional
kind, with rollers for logs. Circular
saw driven by breastshot wheel.
  A small overshot wheel privides
electricity for nearby house.
  A third mill turns various objects.
One man seen at work making
spirtles (stirrers for porridge). A complex
series of pulleys & belts drives about
20 different lathes. Other implements
oncde stood outside the building and
[23982-23983]
2982
were driven by belts from inside.
  Building vibrates in a character-
istic way from the motion of the
wheel. The man has to cut rather
slowly and to respond to variations in
the water power.
  Framed building of 2 stories on
stone base. Vertical boards with battens
covering joins.
 Birch is the wood used - sup-
posed to be difficult to get suitable
trees!
The kiln-house is for drying
timber. Near-disaster a year ago
when part of it caught fire.
Lades divide the water between
the three wheels.
          [DIAG]

They are about 100 yds long, of
sawn planks, box section, on wooden
trestles. Some leakage.
  Buildings & equipment are in
quite hgod condition, maintained by
Callander & his colleagues. The
sawmill wheel has recently been re-
built on its wrough-iron frame.
19th-cnt. origin.

Bucket Mill. Derelict about 25 years,
[23984-23985]
3984
and much of the equipment removed
to the National Museum of Scotland,
but Callander intends to revive
it and has already rebuilt the
lade.
  Function is to smooth stave built
buckets by turning them in a 
rotating wooden form. The skill in
making a bucket is mainly in cutting
the last stave.
  Overshot wheel with iron frame,
the wooden parts have been removed
for replacement.
  Building is framed, with upright
boards & battens, these very rotten,
but the frame appears to be sound.
Chimney of rubble masonry, which
is in poor condition through leeming.
Roof of red-painted corrugated iron,
3985
which has lasted well.
  Nearby house was the first in
Birse to have electricity (from the
mill) and the last not to have elec-
tricity (when the mill decayed).
  A hornbeam in the garden of
the house; appears to be Carpinus
betulis; about 20 ft high; quite
abundantly fruitimillng.
Weir to Fingan Mill. Recently re-
built by Callander & his colleagues,
of logs & earth.

Haugh End. Callander's house,
the last remaining one of a deser-
ted village.
3-celled house, with small 
middle bay & chimneyu at each
end. Built partly of granite boul- 
[23986-23987]
3986
ders and partly of quarried stone
(marks of plug-&-feathers). Said 
to be 19th-cent., but much altered
including roof-raise.
  Splayed windows (splay inside).
  Callander is a professional
stave-dyker and the garden contains
many examples. The stones are
natural granite boulders of several
kinds of granite  - a few are
erratics of other stones. Most
types of dyke are coursed,
  A fine big ash-tree and a
big birch. The birch is very
pendulous wihich is characteristic
(though not exclusive) of trees near
habitations. Ashes are mainly near
habitations in this area.

Hut-circle. On a nearby hillock.
39087
Said to be Iron Age. A tumbled
circular stone-wall about 30 ft
dia., sited on rocky ground. A
possible second one about 200 yds
away. Nearby deeper soils have
stone-piles said to indicate con-
temporary cultivation.

Heathland, This hillock has closely-
grazed grass & heather. Sheep &
abundant rabbits. Furze-bushes
freq., grazed but not mushroom-
shaped, said to be periodically
burnt.

Moorland. In this area not invaded
by trees; but the burns are said
to have occ. birches and aspens.
Patches of sec. birchwood at lower
[23988-23989]
3988
altitudes.
Callander has planted a grove
of Caledonian Pines.

Dalsack. A somewhat similar house
but more complicated. Has been
extended. Masonry shows clear
evidence of a roof-raise.

Mortar. Callander says the lack of
surviving early buildings is connected
with the use of non-calcareous
mortar. He showed me an example
- clayey sand like the grsnite grown
of Cornwall, but evidently redeposi-
ted by glaciers.

Tors. None very characteristic in the
area.
Beautiful warm day.

Birches. Betula pubescens is prob.
the only species in woods. Pendula
is freq. on a freestanding tree - a
fine one at Huaughend in Birse.

Hedgesd. Occur chiefly E. of Strachsn.
In many places tufts of broom,
brier & ash have arisen at base of
fences, but are rarely approaching
continuity.
Mixed hedges involving gesn & birch-
cherry occ.
Hawthorn is quite rare in hedges.
No hedges appear to have been cut
recently. Many sre grown up tall or
have great rows of beech.

Beec9h. Very common planted tree from
Strachan eastward. Largest about 4 ft

boundary is visible from the road as

number of separate sections, probably
too high to be artificial; it may be
a row of small eskers, of [???? eskers], of which
there are many in the area.

Ash fruiting freq. in Northumberland
- about 1 tree in 3.

Tullos Hill, S.E. of Aberdeen. Some
remaining heathland, but much en-
croached by the town dump.

Tay Bridge. The piers of the old

of 2 (or 4) cylinders of brick with
a square hollow in the centre of
