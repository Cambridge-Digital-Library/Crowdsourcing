and frequent in hedges and along
rivers up to the entrance of Glen Tamar.
   Occasional wych-elm avenues 
up to country-houses.
3877
Dee up to Banchory.
  Mainly agricutural; arable &
pasture about equal. Mostly stone-
wall country, but many hedges, &
hedgerow trees many.
  Most houses appear to be 19th-cent.,
one 18th-cent. seen.
  No native woodland; even Funach
Wood is thoroughly coniferized.

Bridge of Feugh. Fine bridge if 2 great
arches in medieval tradition. Cutwaters are 
1/2-octagons.

clear brown stream, slightly frothy.
Fringed by alders (here only along the
main rivers & streams). [Douglasin]
  An American Spiraea (not sali-
cifolia) forms thickets near the ford.

land with some arable. Moors close
in on the adjoining mountains.
  Great beeches on the way up to

  Corsedarder Hill is a tract of
brackeny moorland. Much birchwood
near road, prob. recent, more exten-
sive than shown on the O.S. 1".

Burning. All the higher hills are oatched
with areas of dufferent ages of regrowth,
exceot Glen Tanar.

Park contains many great elms and
beeches but no very old trees.

Dinner. Above Aboyne the valley is
[23980-23981]
3980
full of birchwoods - much more 
than shown on the O.S.

Potarch Inn, Birse. 607973
  Here is a small common, said
to be an overnight stance for drovers
using the main N.-S. road over 
Cairn's Mount.

Robin Callander says that al-
most all the commons in Scotland
were privatized in the 17th & 18th 
cent. This one now has, ironically,
a sign "No Overnight Parking".
Much birchwood since the O.S. on
the heather moors from here to
the S.E. (Muckle Ord).

Fingan Mill.
Sawmill with circular saw.
Kiln room - old Aberdeen trailer
voiler.
Sawmill - breastshot
electicity -[???? ting]overshot wheel
Turnery - undershot.

     Three adjacent mills.
  Sawmill is of a conventional
kind, with rollers for logs. Circular
saw driven by breastshot wheel.
  A small overshot wheel privides
electricity for nearby house.
  A third mill turns various objects.
One man seen at work making
spirtles (stirrers for porridge). A complex
series of pulleys & belts drives about
20 different lathes. Other implements
oncde stood outside the building and
[23982-23983]
2982
were driven by belts from inside.
  Building vibrates in a character-
istic way from the motion of the
wheel. The man has to cut rather
slowly and to respond to variations in
the water power.
  Framed building of 2 stories on
stone base. Vertical boards with battens
covering joins.
 Birch is the wood used - sup-
posed to be difficult to get suitable
trees!
The kiln-house is for drying
timber. Near-disaster a year ago
when part of it caught fire.
Lades divide the water between
the three wheels.
          [DIAG]

They are about 100 yds long, of
sawn planks, box section, on wooden
trestles. Some leakage.
  Buildings & equipment are in
quite hgod condition, maintained by
Callander & his colleagues. The
sawmill wheel has recently been re-
built on its wrough-iron frame.
19th-cnt. origin.

Bucket Mill. Derelict about 25 years,
[23984-23985]
3984
and much of the equipment removed
to the National Museum of Scotland,
but Callander intends to revive
it and has already rebuilt the
lade.
  Function is to smooth stave built
buckets by turning them in a 
rotating wooden form. The skill in
making a bucket is mainly in cutting
the last stave.
  Overshot wheel with iron frame,
the wooden parts have been removed
for replacement.
  Building is framed, with upright
boards & battens, these very rotten,
but the frame appears to be sound.
Chimney of rubble masonry, which
is in poor condition through leeming.
Roof of red-painted corrugated iron,
3985
which has lasted well.
  Nearby house was the first in
Birse to have electricity (from the
mill) and the last not to have elec-
tricity (when the mill decayed).
  A hornbeam in the garden of
the house; appears to be Carpinus
betulis; about 20 ft high; quite
abundantly fruitimillng.
Weir to Fingan Mill. Recently re-
built by Callander & his colleagues,
of logs & earth.

Haugh End. Callander's house,
the last remaining one of a deser-
ted village.
3-celled house, with small 
middle bay & chimneyu at each
end. Built partly of granite boul- 
[23986-23987]
3986
ders and partly of quarried stone
(marks of plug-&-feathers). Said 
to be 19th-cent., but much altered
including roof-raise.
  Splayed windows (splay inside).
  Callander is a professional
stave-dyker and the garden contains
many examples. The stones are
natural granite boulders of several
kinds of granite  - a few are
erratics of other stones. Most
types of dyke are coursed,
  A fine big ash-tree and a
big birch. The birch is very
pendulous wihich is characteristic
(though not exclusive) of trees near
habitations. Ashes are mainly near
habitations in this area.

Hut-circle. On a nearby hillock.
39087
Said to be Iron Age. A tumbled
circular stone-wall about 30 ft
dia., sited on rocky ground. A
possible second one about 200 yds
away. Nearby deeper soils have
stone-piles said to indicate con-
temporary cultivation.

Heathland, This hillock has closely-
grazed grass & heather. Sheep &
abundant rabbits. Furze-bushes
freq., grazed but not mushroom-
shaped, said to be periodically
burnt.

Moorland. In this area not invaded
by trees; but the burns are said
to have occ. birches and aspens.
Patches of sec. birchwood at lower
[23988-23989]
3988
altitudes.
Callander has planted a grove
of Caledonian Pines.

Dalsack. A somewhat similar house
but more complicated. Has been
extended. Masonry shows clear
evidence of a roof-raise.

Mortar. Callander says the lack of
surviving early buildings is connected
with the use of non-calcareous
mortar. He showed me an example
- clayey sand like the grsnite grown
of Cornwall, but evidently redeposi-
ted by glaciers.

Tors. None very characteristic in the
area.
Beautiful warm day.

Birches. Betula pubescens is prob.
the only species in woods. Pendula
is freq. on a freestanding tree - a
fine one at Huaughend in Birse.

Hedgesd. Occur chiefly E. of Strachsn.
In many places tufts of broom,
brier & ash have arisen at base of
fences, but are rarely approaching
continuity.
Mixed hedges involving gesn & birch-
cherry occ.
Hawthorn is quite rare in hedges.
No hedges appear to have been cut
recently. Many sre grown up tall or
have great rows of beech.

          Denny Wood.
Enclosure of c. 1963. Thicket
of birch & vacc; oaks now c.
8 ft high, birch as little more.
Euphorbia amygdaloides freq.
Much beech in places, under
shade of birch.
One small, much bittern-d9wn
Uc!

Outside enclosure, much birch
of similar age in thickets. Peter Ed-
wards says these arise where ponies
congregate and dung; there are
usually bramble patches. The
thickets cover only a few % of the
ground.

Enclosure was of 2 acres, made
as an experiment. Probably al-
4011
ready contained some birch. May
have been some felling & perhaps
planting. Fence waqs removed in
c. 1981.
  Outside the fence Denny wood
has about 40% canopy, about equally
beech & oak, with some birch. Oaks
of various ages from about 70 upwards,
a few may exceed 300; pollards
doubtful.  Prob all robur. Dead oaks
underrepresented.
  Beech about 50-200 years; many
died in 1976-7 and have been
removed.The place is somewhat tidied
of deadwood.
  Hollies few, possible pollards,
some very tsal, not apparently asso-
ciated with oak.
Birch mostly of 1940s, a few
somewhat older.

now severe.  The enclosures were
made to keep out horses &
cattle, but not deer.

Lyndhurst Park cont. 1291-Tubbs
  The outer park bank is broad &
very eroded; it forms the crest of a
ridge on White Moor, a heath of
Erica cinerea.
  Soil of this heath is a fine white
sand, very podsolized.
  Inner bank is weak, rather
fresh & acute, it sparates the Forest
4013
from inclosures of semi-improved
pasture.
Lyndhurst to Southampton road.
Road is bordered by sec. woods
of oak & birch. Most of the birch
(here as elsewhere in the forest) seems
to be of the 1940s; oak is older.
No old trees seen here.

Matley Wood cont.
  Yews thinly scattered, with a
strong browse-line, often feeble.
  Wood is bisected by a holloway
with many small pollard hollies.
Also Tilia cf platy and occasional
big sycamores aiong this lane.
  Oaks all robur ?c.70 to 300
y old. A few of the oldest are pollards,
[24014-24015]
4014
prob. none more than 4 ft dia.

[DIAG]

Beech c. 50 to 150 y. old. Young
trees in core of wood are a sy-
camores, large pole-sized, which
fill gaps & form a large part 
of the canopy.
  Fringe of wood is mainly birch,
prob. 2 generations. Pine along N.
side, said all to be self-sown.
Oaks occ. in fringe.

  Dead trees rather few, some
collapsed birches and a few oaks.
  Grazing evidently severe, strong
browse-line esp on holly & yew.
  Grass & bracken, no specifically 
woodland plants.
  Wood is said to be on  a small
cap of glacial gravel with some 
clay, it is less podsolized than the
surroundings. Reputedly the site
of Matley, a pre-D.B. settlement,
but nothing seen.
On S. side wood abutd heath.
Heath is little grazed, but just
sufficient to prevent birch invasion.
  On N. side wood abuts bog.
A strong woodbank lies just inside
the present fringe. Last trees to-
4017
wards bog are pines, which are slow-
growing & chlorotick on peat.

Matley Bog. Sphagnum spp. co-
dominant with Narthecium & Erica
tetralina. Molinia scsrce, small.
Very wet;  around Fort Wood there
is the deepest water and the
bog is a Schringmoor which shakes
when trodden on.
  Narthecium much grazed.
Grazing diminishes away from
edges.
  Some weask Phragmites round
the edges of Fort Wood. Myrica only
in the wood; abundant.
  Some hummock structure.
  Bog evidently too wet to be
invaded by trees.   
[24018-24019]

  Surface slopes distinctly down
to the N. Adjoining Matley Wood
the bog climbs a slope of seversl
degrees; here it is drier, with Callu-
na but also Sphagnum.

Matley Passage. The stream is
semi-canalized, it is said in the
19th cent., and fringed by alders.
Alders strongly coppiced, with stools
to 2 1/2 ft dia.; grassland under-
neath grazed.

Denny Inclosure. the northern
bsnk, C, is weak snd acute,
cut through by a modern straightern-
ing of the main road.  On the E.
side, D, it becomes strong but
still acute.

  Inclosure mostly Scots Pines.
Towards Denny Wood it becomes
a dense stand of polesized syca-
mores.

Black Down. Dry heather heath
with several barrows on hilltops;
one ofthese is covered with furze.
The only trees on these heaths are
a very few hollies.
  Woods have slighty enlarged

Roadside Trench. Alongside road
in Marshwood parish. N.W. side
of road is separated from Staple
Wood  by pastures c. 70 yds wide.
Wood is apparently intact ancient.
Birchlands Wood, but full of
bungalows.

Grazing P. Edwards says there
are 3000 ponies and 1500-2000
cattle; there are as many ponies
as there have ever been. Much
anxiety about effect on trees.
Ponies at this density are soci-
4021
able animals; they feed & dung
in particular places. They are grass
feeders and ignore trees & saplings
while grass is available; but from 
November onwards they feed on
trees, esp. alders. They are shy of
entering thickets of trees or even
bracken, preferring to feed in the 
open. They will not touch heather.
  Much of the heathland is not
much grazed even by cattle; trees are
very slow to invade the leached soils.


Invasion of Trees. Has happened
locally, at the edges of existing
woods since the 1940s period of
slack grazing.
  Post-1940 trees are mainly
birch, with much less oak.

In places (though not at the sam-
pling face) there is a strong layer of
stumps & tree-roots corresponding to
200 cm in the fence. Most of them
are birch, but one definite hazel
(with bark lichens). They are
well within the peat, which extends
at least 1 1/2 m below them. No oak
noted, and oak is not prominent in
the pollen diagram.
  Hazel now occurs in Castle Beck
and Jugga Howe Beck ravines.
  The moor is now planted with
4031
lodgepole pine (as seen in the
Rocky Mts) and an Abies (which
has not prospered). At 969986
in the pltn is a peat-bog, ap-
parently the remains of a raised bog,
with at least 3 1/2m of peat. It
has been dug into by peat-cutters.
Some activity at a small face
within the last year; a face about
100 yds long has been worked
within the last few years but is
now gray with Caldonia pyxidate.
No sign  of peat-drying. The 
face is cut to a depth of about
2 m, usually ending just below
the layer of stumps.
  Calluna and Erica tetralix are
ab. on  the uncut peat.  The
bottoms of the cuttings, where dry,
are colonized by Calluna; by Eri-
