Hardly any ties
Only the [!!!!foundations]wall-bases survive.
The site is N.E. of Mayday Farm,

don Lodge" so it could be the 
site of a medievsl warren-lodge.

Elm disease (?)

[DIAG]

Affected trees are apparently
clonally different from unaffected:
affected carpinifolia with
narrower leqves, less suckering.
Unaffected procera with broad

twisted leaves.
  
  Leavres of earliest dead

  Slight Disease was first evident
late June.
Concentrated type, trees
dying branch by branch mainly
from the top downwards.
Wet-wood also present.
Leaves of earliest dead
branches  now mainly fallen.
Slight epinasty and retention
of end leaves on outer
twigs.  Epicormics relatively
few, not showing epinasty.
  Numerous suckers of both
genotypes among infected
trees: suckers almost entirely
free of infection.
Very strong staining of
this year's early wood.

Upper grassland  i.e. D is
relatively poor in species, and has
probably been plowed.

  B is surrounded by a mas-
sive bank and ditch interrupted
in two places by the brook. The
earthwork is largely covered by
trees snd scrub, notably by at
least three different elms.  Em-
bedded in the lcrub are many
pollards, oak, ash, maple, elm,
aome of them overtopped and
declining.

Definitions.  Severe damage
means complete scorching of
6023
substantial lengths of a hedge
or substantial areas of grassy
vegetation.  If the fire extends
into the crown of trees this
is classed separately.
  Narrow margin is one <20
ft wide.
  Only fields which could be
definitely categorized were re-
corded.  Many were unrecogniz-
able because of cultivation,
the cultivated fields were in-
cluded where possible.

      Elm Disease
S.E. London suburbs.
About 70% of elms af-
fected and c. 40% dead.  (This
is total elm mortality from
this and other sources). Trees
[16024-16025]
6024
mainly isolated or in small
grouos; disease appears dis-
tributed randomly irrespective
of greoping.  Trees tend to be
either dead or clear. Elm geno-
type is not very suckering
and population rather old.
Mainly mature trees attacked,
some over-mature.
  This applies to U. procera
which nearly all the elm is
