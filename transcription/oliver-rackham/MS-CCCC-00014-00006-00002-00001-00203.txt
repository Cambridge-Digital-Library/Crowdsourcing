Substance of bricks variable
mostly hard
Other bricks are standard soft red,
a few probably Woolpit.
Hardly any ties
Only the [!!!!foundations]wall-bases survive.
The site is N.E. of Mayday Farm,
797837. Hodskinson calls it "Bran-
don Lodge" so it could be the 
site of a medievsl warren-lodge.
     Lakenheath Door.
  Between church tower and "Galilee
Porch", so has been out of the wea-
ther since the latter was built.  Pre-
served by having a Georgian panelled
door attached to its outer face.
Shown me by Mr Munday, former
vicar.
