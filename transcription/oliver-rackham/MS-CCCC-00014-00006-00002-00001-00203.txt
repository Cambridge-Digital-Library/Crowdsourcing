Elm disease (?)

Affected trees are apparently
clonally different from unaffected:
affected carpinifolia with
narrower leaves, less suckering.
Unaffected procera with broad

Concentrated type, trees
dying branch by branch mainly

Leaves of earliest dead
branches  now mainly fallen.
Slight epinasty and retention
of end leaves on outer
twigs.  Epicormics relatively

free of infection.

trees snd scrub, notably by at
least three different elms.  Em-

Definitions.  Severe damage
means complete scorching of
6023
substantial lengths of a hedge
or substantial areas of grassy
vegetation.  If the fire extends
into the crown of trees this
is classed separately.
  Narrow margin is one <20
ft wide.
  Only fields which could be
definitely categorized were re-
corded.  Many were unrecogniz-
able because of cultivation,
the cultivated fields were in-
cluded where possible.

      Elm Disease
S.E. London suburbs.
About 70% of elms af-
fected and c. 40% dead.  (This
is total elm mortality from
this and other sources). Trees
[16024-16025]
6024
mainly isolated or in small
groups; disease appears dis-
tributed randomly irrespective
of grouping.  Trees tend to be
either dead or clear. Elm geno-
type is not very suckering
and population rather old.
Mainly mature trees attacked,
some over-mature.
  This applies to U. procera
which nearly all the elm is.
An avenue of U. sarniensis
had nearly every tree infected
mod.-severe.
  Infection where partial is
of the concentrated type, going
through the tree big branch by
big branch.
  Elms from about 1/4 of
all trees, but 3/4 of all dead
6025
or defoliated trees.
Central Kent (via Ashford).
  Elm rare, mainly procera,
rather gregarious. Nearly every
elm group has one or more
affected tree: total infection
must be 10-15% of which
most is mod. or severe.  Very
