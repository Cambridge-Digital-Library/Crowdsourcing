February 5.
Matching Park. Numerous
old conifers & middle-aged
poplars. Structure otherwise
intact.  Much elm. Massive wood
bank. Some recent coppicing?
Matching Tye.  small heavily
trodden green.
This area is rather suburb-
anized.
Matching Green.  Mainly [????]-
proved grass.  Probably grazed.
Some encroachments of varying
date up to submarginal road.
Good big pond. Little scrub.
Elm pollards in closes.
  Some hedgerow hornbeam
pollards in Willingale Spain.
[16646-16647]
6646
Skreens Park.  Only frag-
ments remain.  No pollards seen.
Elm Disease. Some in Willing-
ale Spain.  Otherwise none seen.

Row Wood. Still exists; apparently
ash-maple.

February 11.
About 6 great pollard oaks
in a paddock before Bro-
wick Hall, Wymondham.
Feb. 12.
Elm Disease.
Old Hsrlow, opp. Post Office.
3 larger pole-sized on edge
of a belt of U. carpin.  Marked
for felling; two apparently
dead, third has live epicormics.
Five comparable stumps within
2 ft of base of one elm
felled a year ago. Coppice
shoots & suckers nearly all
healthy.  Neighbouring trees
flowering.
  This is a particularly good
season for the flowering of elms

& Essex
Feb. 15.  BUFF WOOD.
Feb. 16. WARDEN WARREN and
SOUTHILL PARK.
Feb. 19.
Leckhampton Horsechestnuts.
  Tree no. 10 has copious black
and reddish gel-like exudation
all round rhe trunk.  Clive Bra-
sier, here on a visit, recognized
this as a Phytophthera symptom
and took samples.  The tree is
severely infected and it is dif-
ficult to see how it maintains
connexion with the ground.  Attack
extends at least 6 ft above
ground level. The diseased cam-
bium is brown and is sharply
demarcated from healthy tissue.
6649
Similar symptoms seen in several
other trees.  Recent wet weather
has presumably brought them on.

BUFF WOOD: D.E.D.
First oxlip in flower.

Feb. 26.
Visit to the N.E. part of Dan-
bury Hills.  Curious combination
of woodland, woodpasture, scrub,
of woodland, wood pasture, scrub,
plantations (mostly derelict),
plotland,small farms. Much
permanent grass with hedges
and old pollards.  Much of
the land is derelict nurseries.
March 3.
HAYLEY WOOD.
[16650-16651]

March 7.
  Alice Holt Forest.
(visit for lecture; with J. Gibbs and
C. Brasier).
  Rather less than half the 
wooded part of the Forest consists
of pure stands of oak.  These are
evenaged, very uniform ("nursery"
stock), mostly of 2nd quarter of
19th cent, rather slow-grown but
otherwise of good timber quality.
Close-set, little underwood (chest-
nut in places but sparse). Ground
vegetation sparse, acid, mostly
brambles.  Remarkably monotonous.
  The remainder is conifers of
various ages, mostly 10-50 years.
Corsican and Douglas predominate.
  The clearings are mostly small
grass fields, rectilinear.
6651
The only ancient tree is an
oak some 4 ft dia., nearly dead,
in front of Alice Holt Lodge.
Probably not a pollard.
  Typical oaks in extreme N.W.
corner by station.
  Wide rides, along which
specimen tree of various maples
have been planted.
  Phytophthera attacking
snakebark maple.
  Stand of Douglas, some 15
years' growth, on deep sand.
Follows oak. Severe Armillaria
damage leading to windblow.
About a third of the trees have
recently fallen.  Affected trees have
next to no roots but tops look
normal.  Nearby Corsican unaf-
fected.
[16652-16653]
6652
Near Forest Lodge (in the S.)
I was shown a Roman pottery kiln
site, one of several in the Forest.
Several piles of wastes which
appear as irregular mounds, about
30 ft dia. x 4 ft high. This is
now in oak-wood, rather older
than the rest of the plantations,
oaks less invariable than usual,
with sparse hazel and bramble.

Possibly a slight agger on the

inaccessible. This wing has clearly

About 5 ac., very beautiful

ably Middle Fen used to be like
this.

A and B.
Privately owned.  Neglected but
little bush growth, except lines
of trees  & bushes at the edges.

C and D.
Privately owned. Largely over-
grown with sallow and tree
willow, occ. alder. Ground
vegetation with nettles dom. through
out, hops ab., ab Galium
apanine, occ. Cirs. an.  Boundary
with Middle Fen is sharp.
  D and E are Full of derelict
sheds & hen-houses. C and D
6723
were probably pightles attached
to a vanished house in E.
  The drift to the E. and N.
of C and D is also overgrown
with nettles and thistles and
almost impassable with bushes
and fallen trees. Whole area
has been unused for many years.
Striking contrast with the non-
entrophicated and little over-grown
Middle Fen.

Old Fen.
Common rights of grazing
- long neglected and recently
extinguished - peat cutting and 
wood cutting.  Wood-cutting
involves the ringing of a
hand-bell for 3 minutes once
each season, after which
[16724-16725]
6724
wood-cutters stake out their
claims for that year. Rights
are for the poor of the parish 
which in practice means any-
one. About 4 people still exer-
cise them. Coppicing accord-
ing to John Trist is done
badly and high. A few stools
were seen mainly in the S.E.
part of the Fen, but they amount
in all to <<1 c. of underwood,
all of it alder & sallow.  Wood
rights appear to involve recent
woodland; there are no old
stools.
  The S. and E. margins form
a sharply defined area, much
higher than the rest of the
fen and apparently on mineral
soil.  Shown as rough grass &

  Towards N.W. of fen is an
ill-defined patch of carr prob
ably of similar age (but not on old
25") with abundant Humulus.
Almost entirely alder.
  Along the river is a raised
strip chiefly of sand (mainly
old dredgings). Rough grass.

All these elms seem to

Epicormics of big trees often
