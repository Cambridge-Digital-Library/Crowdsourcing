February 5.
Matching Park. Numerous
old conifers & middle-aged
poplars. Structure otherwise
intact.  Much elm. Massive wood
bank. Some recent coppicing?
Matching Tye.  small heavily
trodden green.
This area is rather suburb-
anized.
Matching green.  Mainly [????]-
proved grass.  Probably grazed.
Some encroachmenrts of vsrying
date up to submarginal road.
Good big pond. Little scrub.
Elm pollards in closes.
  Some hedgerow hornbeam
pollards in Willingale Spain.
[16646-16647]

Skreens Park.  Only frag-
ments remain.  No pollards seen.
Elm Disease. Some in Willing-
ale Spain.  Otherwise none seen.

Row Wood. Still exists; apparently
ash-maple.

About 6 great pollard oaks
in a paddock before Bro-
wick Hall, Wymondham.

Elm Disease.
Old Hsrlow, opp. Post Office.
3 larger pole-sized on edge
of a belt of U. carpin.  Marked
for felling; two apparently
dead, third has live epicormics.
Five comparable stumps within
2 ft of base of one elm
felled a year ago. Coppice
shoots & suckers nearly all
healthy.  Neighbouring trees
flowering.
  This is a particuarly good
season for the flowering of elms

Feb. 15.  BUFF WOOD.
Feb. 16. WARDEN WARREN and
SOUTHILL PARK.
Feb. 19.
Leckhampton Horsechestnuts.
  Tree no. 10 has copious black
and reddish gel-like exudation
all round rhe trunk.  Clive Bra-
sier, here on a visit, recognized
this as a Phyophthera symptom
and took samples.  the tree is
severely infected and it is dif-
ficult to see how it maintains
connexion with the ground.  Attack
extends at least 6 ft above
ground level. The diseased cam-
bium is brown and is sharply
demarcated from healthy tissue.
6649
Similar symptoms seen in several
other trees.  Recent wet weather
has presumably brought them on.

BUFF WOOD: D.E.D.
First oxlip in flower.

Feb. 26.
Visit to the N.E. part of Dan-
bury Hills.  Curious combinaton (mostly derelict)
of woodland, wood pasture, scrub,
plotland, small farms. Much
permanent grass with hedges
and old pollards.  Much of
the land is derelict nurseries.
March 3.
HAYLEY WOOD.
[16650-16651]

March 7.
  Alice Holt Forest.
(visit for lecture; with J. Gibbs and
C. Brasier).
  Rather less than half the 
wooded part of the Forest consists
of pure stands of oak.  These are
evenaged, very uniform ("nursery"
stock), mostly of 2nd quarter of
19th cent, rather slow-grown but
otherwise of good timber quality.
Close-set, little underwood (chest-
nut in places but sparse). Ground
vegetation sparse, acid, mostly
brambles.  Remarkably monotonous.
  The remainder is conifers of
various ages, mostly 10-50 years.
Corsican and Douglas predominate.
  The clearings are mostly small
grass fields, rectilinear.
6651
The only ancient tree is an
oak some 4 ft dia., nesrly dead,
in front of Alice Holt Lodge.
Probably not a pollard.
  Typical oaks in extreme N.W.
corner by station.
  Wide rides, along which
specimen tree of various maples
have been planted.
  Phytophthera attacking
snakebark maple.
Stqnd of Douglas, some 15
years' growth, on deep sand.
Gollows oak. Severe Armillaria
damage leading to windblow.
About a third of the trees have
recently fallen.  Affected trees have
next to no roots but tops look
normal.  Nearby Corsican unaf-
fected.
[16652-16653]
6652
Near Forest Lodge (in the S.)
I was shown a Roman pottery kiln
site, one of several in the Forest.
Several piles of wastes which
appear as irregular mounds, about
30 ft dia. x 4 ft high. This is
now in oak-wood, rather older
than the rest of the plantations,
oaks less invariable than usual,
with sparse hazel and bramble.
