9 Feb. 19983 cont.
Cprs Ddygyn. Anglesey. A vast
plain, divided into small square
pastures. Rough grass & rushes, in
places prob. bracken. Hedges
mostly disused and no longer acting
as boundaries. Sheep-grazed.
Large area of wild vegetation.
Small farms.

S.W. Anglesey. Biggish fields of
improved grass. Very thick mixed
hedges. Hedgerow trees small,
windswept.
  Traces of very long  R&F in
one field.
  Rare arable in Anglesey.
  Scattered farmsteads.
  Llnau Coron & Faelog exist.
Rock outcrops only near Llyn
[23006-23007]
3006
Faelog.

Tywyn Trewau. Now mostly levelled
part golf-course, part airfield
(civil & RAF).

Holy Island. Crossed to by a
causeway wirh only a small culvert.
Much arable. Small patches of
furze & bog. Field boundaries mostly
walls, sometimes doubled by hedges.
Some forestry plantations.

Elms in Trinity College.3007
Elms.
1. Tk sny. BK in elongated
plates, later rugged. Epi. rare.
Twigs divaricate, not thick.
Br. wide-angled, irregular.
Flowers early, anthers exserted,
about half dehisced. Um.

2. Tk crooked. Bk fluted, sl.
reticulate. Epi many, in strong
burrs. Br. widish angled, arching.
Twigs v. thick divaricate.
Fls. mod-late.(a few anthers exserted)
Twigs rather          Umxg
strongly pendulous.

3. Tk very crooked and sinuous,
but massive & strongly apical.
Br. wide-angled, crooked. BK
platey like Up. Epi v. few,
[23008-23009]
3008
scattered. Tw small, irregular.
Fls. late (buds closed). Umxp.

4. Several of the Up group, with
rather crooked trunks, but otherwise
typical, they are more like some of the
"procera" elms of America than of Eng-
land. Middle-flowering: a few anthers
exserted.

5. Ulmus glabra fairly typical, fls
late (buds hardly swollen).

  Elms elsewhere in Dublin are fairly
common. Um and U are about equally
prominent. No Up of the typical English
form.
  DED exists and has killed perhaps
15% of elms.
3009
Botanic Gardens of TCD
Zamia integrifolia. A small cycad
with rather slender forked trunk
and pinnate leaves. Fertile.

Phyllanthus speciosus & epiphyllanthus
Two members of the Ruscaceae with
many flowers round ghe edges of
cladodes.

Arceuthobium. A small individual
in the base of a potted Juniperus? com-
munis about 1 ft high, kept in a 
cool greenhouse. The juniper is of
unknown provenance sand may be 
many years old.

Cycads. A fine collection, some of them
many years old, but only one indi-
vidual of each species - they are all
dioecious.
[23010-23011]
3010
Quercus farnetto. Big oak - 
looks very like Q. macrocarpa.
Bark fluted. Twigs very thick,
curving, big buds, persistent sti-
ules. The site on which it grows is
to be sold for development. The biggest
I have aseen.

Decaisnea farguesii. A curious
pachgycaul tree with slightly-branched
stems about 1 in. thick, looking like
some of the N. American  Aralias.

Saxifraga oppositifolia vasr. paradoxa.
Now in flower.

Todea barbata. A cutting from a
famous plant, said to be the oldest
glasshouse plant in Ireland.
3011

-branched individuals in the open.
Some damaged by the 1976 winter;
one has been killed to the base, but
is coppicing.

Black Poplar. Two middle-sized in-
dividuals, Ranelagh Green. Rather
young, but showing most of the
characteristics including the twig
curves.

  Very cold day, keen N.E. wind;
a little snow. No frost.

P. nigra, but bark sinuous &
yellowish, and bosses few & small.

Rooks. An enormous flight of rooks
seen passing over Charleville about
dusk, from the north. they flew
over in their hundreds for over
half an hour. The complete flight is 
said to take several hours and to
comprise many thousands of birds.

Hedges, Kildare and Odffaly are
hedged counties except the bogs. The
farmsteads are of varying sizes, the
3015
house often very small, usually
set back from road (dots on map).
A strongly dispersed landscape.
Fields usually 1-10 acres, nearly
all grass. Hedges appear all
to survive. Widely variable in
shape, structure, composition, and
maintenance. Majority are not 
straight. Massive banks frequent.
Most hedges sre mixed. Com-
monest species: ash>hawthorn
>elm,blackthorn, sallow. No maple
seen. Ash often outnumbers thorn.
Closely-cut and neglected hedges
are about equally common.
  Hedgerow trees very numerous
and predominantly young, esp. in
the more neglected hedges. Ash is
by far the commonest. Few willows.
 Pollards are rare.
