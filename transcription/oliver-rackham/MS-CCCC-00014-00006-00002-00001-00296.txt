Elms in Trinity College.3007
Elms.
1. Tk sny. BK in elongated
plates, later rugged. Epi. rare.
Twigs divaricate, not thick.
Br. wide-angled, irregular.
Flowers early, anthers exserted,
about half dehisced. Um.

2. Tk crooked. Bk fluted, sl.
reticulate. Epi many, in strong
burrs. Br. widish angled, arching.
Twigs v. thick divaricate.
Fls. mod-late.(a few anthers exserted)
Twigs rather          Umxg
strongly pendulous.

3. Tk very crooked and sinuous,
but massive & strongly apical.
Br. wide-angled, crooked. BK
platey like Up. Epi v. few,
[23008-23009]
3008
scattered. Tw small, irregular.
Fls. late (buds closed). Umxp.

4. Several of the Up group, with
rather crooked trunks, but otherwise
typical, they are more like some of the
"procera" elms of America than of Eng-
land. Middle-flowering: a few anthers
exserted.

5. Ulmus glabra fairly typical, fls
late (buds hardly swollen).

  Elms elsewhere in Dublin are fairly
common. Um and U are about equally
prominent. No Up of the typical English
form.
  DED exists and has killed perhaps
15% of elms.

Zamia integrifolia. A small cycad
with rather slender forked trunk
and pinnate leaves. Fertile.

Phyllanthus speciosus & epiphyllanthus

Arceuthobium. A small individual
in the base of a potted Juniperus? com-
munis about 1 ft high, kept in a 
cool greenhouse. The juniper is of
unknown provenance sand may be

many years old, but only one indi-
vidual of each species - they are all
dioecious.
