9 Feb. 19983 cont.
Cprs Ddygyn. Anglesey. A vast
plain, divided into small square
pastures. Rough grass & rushes, in
places prob. bracken. Hedges
mostly disused and no longer acting
as boundaries. Sheep-grazed.
Large area of wild vegetation.
Small farms.

S.W. Anglesey. Biggish fields of
improved grass. Very thick mixed
hedges. Hedgerow trees small,
windswept.

Rock outcrops only near Llyn
[23006-23007]
3006
Faelog.

Tywyn Trewau. Now mostly levelled
part golf-course, part airfield
(civil & RAF).

Holy Island. Crossed to by a
causeway wirh only a small culvert.
Much arable. Small patches of
furze & bog. Field boundaries mostly
walls, sometimes doubled by hedges.
Some forestry plantations.

10 February    TRINITY COLLEGE
                  DUBLIN
Elms in Trinity College.3007
Elms.
1. Tk sny. BK in elongated
plates, later rugged. Epi. rare.
Twigs divaricate, not thick.
Br. wide-angled, irregular.
Flowers early, anthers exserted,
about half dehisced. Um.

2. Tk crooked. Bk fluted, sl.
reticulate. Epi many, in strong
burrs. Br. widish angled, arching.
Twigs v. thick divaricate.
Fls. mod-late.(a few anthers exserted)
Twigs rather          Umxg
strongly pendulous.

3. Tk very crooked and sinuous,
but massive & strongly apical.
Br. wide-angled, crooked. BK
platey like Up. Epi v. few,
[23008-23009]
3008
scattered. Tw small, irregular.
Fls. late (buds closed). Umxp.

4. Several of the Up group, with
rather crooked trunks, but otherwise
typical, they are more like some of the
"procera" elms of America than of Eng-
land. Middle-flowering: a few anthers
exserted.

5. Ulmus glabra fairly typical, fls
late (buds hardly swollen).

  Elms elsewhere in Dublin are fairly
common. Um and U are about equally
prominent. No Up of the typical English
form.
  DED exists and has killed perhaps
15% of elms.
3009
Botanic Gardens of TCD
Zamia integrifolia. A small cycad
with rather slender forked trunk
and pinnate leaves. Fertile.

Phyllanthus speciosus & epiphyllanthus
Two members of the Ruscaceae with
many flowers round ghe edges of
cladodes.

Arceuthobium. A small individual
in the base of a potted Juniperus? com-
munis about 1 ft high, kept in a 
cool greenhouse. The juniper is of
unknown provenance sand may be 
many years old.

Cycads. A fine collection, some of them
many years old, but only one indi-
vidual of each species - they are all
dioecious.
[23010-23011]
3010
Quercus farnetto. Big oak - 
looks very like Q. macrocarpa.
Bark fluted. Twigs very thick,
curving, big buds, persistent sti-
ules. The site on which it grows is
to be sold for development. The biggest
I have aseen.

Decaisnea farguesii. A curious
pachgycaul tree with slightly-branched
stems about 1 in. thick, looking like
some of the N. American  Aralias.

Saxifraga oppositifolia vasr. paradoxa.
Now in flower.

Todea barbata. A cutting from a
famous plant, said to be the oldest
glasshouse plant in Ireland.
3011

-branched individuals in the open.
Some damaged by the 1976 winter;
one has been killed to the base, but
is coppicing.

Black Poplar. Two middle-sized in-
dividuals, Ranelagh Green. Rather
young, but showing most of the
characteristics including the twig
curves.

  Very cold day, keen N.E. wind;
a little snow. No frost.

ivied, typical habit, near
Clarkvilla House (S.W. of Eden-
derry).

Deden River. Tract of young birches
prob. on birch.
3013
Elms. Between Kilcock & Innfield.
Freqwuent in hedges - mainly Ug
but some probable hollandica.
Occasional Uc. Little effect of
disease.
Occasional Uc in hedges S. of
Innfield.
Around Edenderry - frequent
Uc, some Ug; little disease.
Ballinayar - frequent Dutch
Elm, like that in Cornwall.
Tullamore - one fine Dutch Elm.
Charleville Park - several huge
Ug, to c. 6 ft dia., great &
spreading, some (?Ucg) with
big bosses. Some DED-show,
several elms long-dead. Prob.
about 25%.
[23014-23015]
3014
Doingeau=Philipstown. Straight-
through one-street town.
  Two raised bogs just E. of it.

Ballinegar. Two black poplars,
2-3 ft dia. Typical habit of
P. nigra, but bark sinuous &
yellowish, and bosses few & small.

Rooks. An enormous flight of rooks
seen passing over Charleville about
dusk, from the north. they flew
over in their hundreds for over
half an hour. The complete flight is 
said to take several hours and to
comprise many thousands of birds.

Hedges, Kildare and Odffaly are
hedged counties except the bogs. The
farmsteads are of varying sizes, the
3015
house often very small, usually
set back from road (dots on map).
A strongly dispersed landscape.
Fields usually 1-10 acres, nearly
all grass. Hedges appear all
to survive. Widely variable in
shape, structure, composition, and
maintenance. Majority are not 
straight. Massive banks frequent.
Most hedges sre mixed. Com-
monest species: ash>hawthorn
>elm,blackthorn, sallow. No maple
seen. Ash often outnumbers thorn.
Closely-cut and neglected hedges
are about equally common.
  Hedgerow trees very numerous
and predominantly young, esp. in
the more neglected hedges. Ash is
by far the commonest. Few willows.
 Pollards are rare.
[23016-23017]
3016
  No oaks see in hedges in 
mid Ireland.

Raised Bogs. Several seen between
Ballinagor and Tullamore, and
two on either side of Derry Wood
4 miles S. of Tullamore.
Surfsce is distinctly domed
and mostly heathery.
The bog N. of Derry Wood
was seen in more detail.. Dominated
by short Calluna, with Eriocs tetralix
v. ab., also Narthecium, Cladonia,
cf arbuscula ab. Much Sphagnum,
chiefly rubellum. Surface quite
firm and easily walked in when
thinly frozen. No appreaciable
tussock-and-pan structure. The
edge of the bog where not en-
croached upon by small fields,
3017
is depressed and brackeny. No
appreaciable  marginal channel
between the bog and the wood.
  The bog S. of the wood is
less well-defined and much
overgrown with birch & sallow.
  Trees on well-developed bogs
are rare: scattered birches etc.
Margins of bogs or sites of
cut-over ones have bichwood
sometimes with pine plantations.
  The Bog of Allen was crossed at
night by straight roads from Carbury
to Allen Wood and from there to
Prosprous. These roads aee full
of depressions where the peat has
subsided. Near Allenwood is a
small peat-burning power-station.
  "Turf" is widely sold at the
wayside and is the chief domestic
[23018-23019]
3018
fuel of Dublin.

Phoenix Park. High boundary wall.
Magnificent ilexes and conifers.

Carbury. Large Tudor-looking
castle in ruins.

Houses. Mostly              [DIAG]
small & symme-
trical, slate roofs
(occ. thatch). One
thatched house in ruins had
earthen walls, but this is said to
be unusual. Fsrm buildingd often
quite substantial. Gabled form
of house less common.

Slieve Bloom. Long whaleback highland
seen in the distance.
3019
Churches. Medieval churches are
quite common, many in ruins.
Many places have a Church of
Ireland church of austere "Com-
misisoners' Gothic" style. These
are oftrn in lonely places among
scattered habitations. Roman Catholic 
churches are more elaborate, with 
spires.

Towns. Vereysmall. Doingeann is
a straight street along a main
road. (Philipstown, from the King
Philip plantation). Tullamore has
a quite complex plan.
  Terrace houses are usual - the
simplest are 1-storey country
houses set end-to-end. Most
towns aee rather crowded, with
some 3- or even 4-storey houses.
[23020-23021]
3020
  No houses seen that are obvi-
ously older than 1800.

Weather. Snow fell in rhe night
in Dublin and [!!!!casued] formed a thin cover.
Day was gloomy, with more snowfall,
and roads in Dublin were rivers 
of ice (specially dangerous in a town 
that has no snow-clearinf arrange-
ments).
  W. of Maynooth snow suddenly
ceased. Brilliant cloudless day,
well below freezing. Most water
(except middle of Charleville Lough)
well frozen. Soft ground and even
bogs frozen enough to bear a 
man. Oce about 1/2" thick on 
pools.
  The Charleville bogs were well
frozen.
3021
12 Feb.   Elms.
  Trunk near-straight. Branches
horizontal, turning downwards but
not pendulous. Epi few in 2 rows
of bosses. Bsrk minutely fluted.
Twigs thickish, divsr. Fls very late
(buds hardly swollen). Ucg.

Dunsoghly.  Dutch Elm and
Um (resembles Cornish). Both
equally common. Dutch is
late-fl. - anthers not quite exser-
ted. Slight DED.
Dublin (general).
40% Up of which 60% sev.-dead
-- some dead at least 4 years.
Possibly 10% of other species.
Killiney to Bray. Uc abundant, possibly
some Ucg; no disease seen.
Bray Uc & cg: some disease in cg.
