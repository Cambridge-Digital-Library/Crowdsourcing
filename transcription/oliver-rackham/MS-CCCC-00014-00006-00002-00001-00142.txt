1968 [SYMBOL]
June 30 cont.
Surface temperature of dark
gray sand in a sheltered place,
5.30 p.m. = 45[SYMBOL] (S. [!!!!] facing
slope) 52[SYMBOL] (S.W. facing). The
latter almost too hot to tread
on barefoot, too hot for the
back of the hand.
Cicadas.
Particularly common in pine
trees, also in olives. Each
insect makes a noise for
about 1/2 minute and then
stops for 1-2 minutes before
starting again. The sound
is like a small electric
drill uttered in pulses
of about 1/3 sec. with short

gaps. In addition to the
shrill component there is a boom-
ing sound which can only be
heard close to. The insects are
remarkably difficult to hear.
6.30 p.m. June 30 F. Xorifi.
Ma[!!!!]ximum reads 102[SYMBOL]F.
Minimum doesn't work.
Replaced horizontal.
Oats are grown on the small
valley on the Myrtos side of
the dig hill. A small stack
awaiting threshing is alive
with grasshoppers. The
plants are pulled up by
the roots.
