1968 [SYMBOL]
June 30 cont.
Surface temperature of dark
gray sand in a sheltered place,
5.30 p.m. = 45[SYMBOL] (S. [!!!!] facing
slope) 52[SYMBOL] (S.W. facing). The
latter almost too hot to tread
on barefoot, too hot for the
back of the hand.
Cicadas.
Particularly common in pine
trees, also in olives. Each
insect makes a noise for
about 1/2 minute and then
stops for 1-2 minutes before
starting again. The sound
is like a small electric
drill uttered in pulses
of about 1/3 sec. with short

[10666-10667]

gaps. In addition to the
shrill component there is a boom-
ing sound which can only be
heard close to. The insects are
remarkably difficult to hear.
6.30 p.m. June 30 F. Xorifi.
Ma[!!!!]ximum reads 102[SYMBOL]F.
Minimum doesn't work.
Replaced horizontal.
Oats are grown on the small
valley on the Myrtos side of
the dig hill. A small stack
awaiting threshing is alive
with grasshoppers. The
plants are pulled up by
the roots.
The villagers say that
the name Myrtos is derived from
the many large [SYMBOL]
which formerly grew where the
banana groves now are, but
were cut down when the
latter were established.
The village of Myrtos is
said to be less than 100
years old. The church is the
only older building.
The village is very regular
in plan (in contrast to Ana-
toli) with wide streets on
a grid pattern. Most of
the houses appear to be
pre-war at least in part,
though some of the older
ones are in ruins. Most

[10668-10669]

of th[!!!!]em[!!!!]ose in use have glass
to the windows. A few have
pithed roofs with "Roman"
tiles but the rest are flat,
of concrete. They are very
hot inside.
The house at the 12
Apostles (by the Turkish Bridge)
is one large room with doors
on two sides and a window.
The roof is of concrete but
the building is old. Iron bars
to the window. A fireplace
in one corner. Furniture is
a double bed, a table, chairs,
some shelves. The summer
cooking place consists of several
stones outside, a fire being
lighted of sticks. There is
a recess in the wall out-
side for an [!!!!]earthern [SYMBOL]
of about 5 gallons for
water. A bunch of [!!!!]dead
Poterium spinosum, [SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL] (Photini: [SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL]) is stuffed into the
mouth. The house is inhabi-
ted by an elderly couple.
Floor of earth, on which
eater, dregs of wine, and
other liquids are poured.
Window has solid wooden
shutters but no glass.
Chickens come in through
the doors.
The meal (a kind of
parish breakfast with the
parson present after the
service) was a copious chicken
stew (containing at least [!!!!]4
fowls for some 12 persons)
with spaghetti and tomatoes.
Preceded by arrack or [SYMBOL]
and accompanied by red
wine. Bread (a spare Commu-
nion loaf) and boiled eggs
and fried cheese-cake.
Photini says the [SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL] is to keep out flies
and geckoes.
The land on the W. bank
of the Myrtos river up to
the Turkish Bridge is highly
cultivated, mainly with groves
of olives and bananas but
with some pomegranates, [!!!!]
[!!!!] almonds, castor-oil, [!!!!]oranges, &c
It is irrigated by an
elaborate system of chan-
nels, beginning with concrete
ducts and ending with
small earthern channels a
few in. wide and deep. They
end in small [!!!!]embanked
areas which may enclose
individual trees. The whole
system has now of course
dried up. [[SYMBOL] 13]
Bananas have suffered
severely apparently from a
freak frost last winter. No
plants have been killed but
the older leaves of most
are dead or reduced to
their midribs, and the
more severely affected plants
