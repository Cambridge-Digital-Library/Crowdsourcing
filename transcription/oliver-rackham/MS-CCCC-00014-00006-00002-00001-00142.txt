1968 [SYMBOL]
June 30 cont.
Surface temperature of dark
gray sand in a sheltered place,
5.30 p.m. = 45[SYMBOL] (S. [!!!!] facing
slope) 52[SYMBOL] (S.W. facing). The
latter almost too hot to tread
on barefoot, too hot for the
back of the hand.
Cicadas.
Particularly common in pine
trees, also in olives. Each
insect makes a noise for
about 1/2 minute and then
stops for 1-2 minutes before
starting again. The sound
is like a small electric
drill uttered in pulses
of about 1/3 sec. with short

[10666-10667]

gaps. In addition to the
shrill component there is a boom-
ing sound which can only be
heard close to. The insects are
remarkably difficult to hear.
6.30 p.m. June 30 F. Xorifi.
Ma[!!!!]ximum reads 102[SYMBOL]F.
Minimum doesn't work.
Replaced horizontal.
Oats are grown on the small
valley on the Myrtos side of
the dig hill. A small stack
awaiting threshing is alive
with grasshoppers. The
plants are pulled up by
the roots.
The villagers say that
the name Myrtos is derived from
the many large [SYMBOL]
which formerly grew where the
banana groves now are, but
were cut down when the
latter were established.
The village of Myrtos is
said to be less than 100
years old. The church is the
only older building.
The village is very regular
in plan (in contrast to Ana-
toli) with wide streets on
a grid pattern. Most of
the houses appear to be
pre-war at least in part,
though some of the older
ones are in ruins. Most

[10668-10669]

of th[!!!!]em[!!!!]ose in use have glass
to the windows. A few have
pithed roofs with "Roman"
tiles but the rest are flat,
of concrete. They are very
hot inside.
The house at the 12
Apostles (by the Turkish Bridge)
is one large room with doors
on two sides and a window.
The roof is of concrete but
the building is old. Iron bars
to the window. A fireplace
in one corner. Furniture is
a double bed, a table, chairs,
some shelves. The summer
cooking place consists of several
stones outside, a fire being
lighted of sticks. There is
a recess in the wall out-
side for an [!!!!]earthern [SYMBOL]
of about 5 gallons for
water. A bunch of [!!!!]dead
Poterium spinosum, [SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL] (Photini: [SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL]) is stuffed into the
mouth. The house is inhabi-
ted by an elderly couple.
Floor of earth, on which
eater, dregs of wine, and
other liquids are poured.
Window has solid wooden
shutters but no glass.
Chickens come in through
the doors.
The meal (a kind of
parish breakfast with the
parson present after the

[10670-10671]

service) was a copious chicken
stew (containing at least [!!!!]4
fowls for some 12 persons)
with spaghetti and tomatoes.
Preceded by arrack or [SYMBOL]
and accompanied by red
wine. Bread (a spare Commu-
nion loaf) and boiled eggs
and fried cheese-cake.
Photini says the [SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL] is to keep out flies
and geckoes.
The land on the W. bank
of the Myrtos river up to
the Turkish Bridge is highly
cultivated, mainly with groves
of olives and bananas but
with some pomegranates, [!!!!]
[!!!!] almonds, castor-oil, [!!!!]oranges, &c
It is irrigated by an
elaborate system of chan-
nels, beginning with concrete
ducts and ending with
small earthern channels a
few in. wide and deep. They
end in small [!!!!]embanked
areas which may enclose
individual trees. The whole
system has now of course
dried up. [[SYMBOL] 13]
Bananas have suffered
severely apparently from a
freak frost last winter. No
plants have been killed but
the older leaves of most
are dead or reduced to
their midribs, and the
more severely affected plants

[10672-10673]

are much set back. Only
a few have flowered.
Myrtle is frequent
along the larger earthern
watercourses. Small bushes
not flowering.
The mulberries (the
commonest street tree in Crete
including Myrtos) are said
to be planted for [SYMBOL],
silkworms. [[SYMBOL] pronounced dz].
A little frog was seen
late at night in an outdoor
lavatory. About 1 1/2 in. long,
dull dusty pink with big dull
green irregular spots. Rather
quiet but very active when
pursued, hopping vigorously.
Pigs are most unusual
but one was seen at
Myrtos tied to a shed by
one leg.
Stars visible in the
south:

[10674-10675]

Among the groves of culti-
vated trees behind Myrtos are
small areas of grass [!!!!]behind[!!!!] on
which a few cattle are tethered.
Oranges are often culti-
vated and moderately flourishing.
A large Citrus tree is com-
monly cultivated, especially around
[SYMBOL]. [SYMBOL]. Big lanceolate dark
green leaves with prominent
pinnate veins. Probably a
grapefruit or citron.
Cockroaches were hunted
in the house at night, coming
out after the light had been
put out.
The house has a small
concrete yard surrounded by
the walls of this and other
houses. At intervals of 9in. or
so are nests of tiny black
ants, which pervade everything
including plant-presses, but
seem to do no harm.
The house contains a tap
of good but always lukewarm
water which runs into a con-
crete sink.
A superb edible fish, the
[SYMBOL] or red mullet, is
caught by the local fisherman
when he operates (which is
irregular). Ab[!!!!]ut 8in. long,
laterally flattened, a beautiful
orange colour.
Few cattle or goats were
seen and no sheep. Women
occasionally drive small num-

[10676-10677]

bers of goats out of the village,
it is not clear where to.
There are numerous asses
in the village whose brays are
deafening at most hours ex-
cept between c. 12 and 4 a.m.
They carry large men, often with
luggage or even a second
man. Mules are less common
and horses rare. Only one
or two tractors were seen.
The village is laid out on
a grid plan quite unlike Ana-
toli. There are blocks of about
4 houses separated by wide
streets planted with mulberries.
Houses of stone or concrete
usually with flat concrete roofs
(often without parapets) but
there are a few with "Roman"
tiles. No exposed building tim-
ber. The village is said to
have been destroyed by the
Germans, who shot over 20 of
the men; in fact many of
the buildings appear to be
older than this and there
are a few ornate doorways,
though nothing apparently older
than the later Turkish period.
The church is concrete or
concreted stone and almost fea-
tureless, but with a fine
carved iconostasis.
All doors and shutters, al-
most without exception, appear
older than the present form of
the buildings they are in.

[10678-10679]

ANTONI'S HOUSE
M: magazine great [SYMBOL]
(lit by a skylight)
Antoni's house (used by
us to live in, he having a
second house where he lives)
like [!!!!]most in the village has
no upper floor. (The few
house that do often have only
one room above.) These houses
are very hot, especially at
night; the dust pours in at
night, and the howling of the
land-wind drives away sleep.
There are several derelict
houses in the village, possibly
from wartime destruction.
Numerous balconies and
flat roofs are used for
sitting out on, usually unfenced
with the typical Cretan disre-
gard of heights.

around the place, mainly
tamerisks, up to c. 9 in. dia.
The inhabitants are very hospit-
able. On my return I asked for water
and they made me eat & drink with
