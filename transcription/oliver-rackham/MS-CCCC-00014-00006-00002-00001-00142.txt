1968 [SYMBOL]
June 30 cont.
Surface temperature of dark
gray sand in a sheltered place,
5.30 p.m. = 45[SYMBOL] (S. [!!!!] facing
slope) 52[SYMBOL] (S.W. facing). The
latter almost too hot to tread
on barefoot, too hot for the
back of the hand.
Cicadas.
Particularly common in pine
trees, also in olives. Each
insect makes a noise for
about 1/2 minute and then
stops for 1-2 minutes before
starting again. The sound
is like a small electric
drill uttered in pulses
of about 1/3 sec. with short

[10666-10667]

gaps. In addition to the
shrill component there is a boom-
ing sound which can only be
heard close to. The insects are
remarkably difficult to hear.
6.30 p.m. June 30 F. Xorifi.
Ma[!!!!]ximum reads 102[SYMBOL]F.
Minimum doesn't work.
Replaced horizontal.
Oats are grown on the small
valley on the Myrtos side of
the dig hill. A small stack
awaiting threshing is alive
with grasshoppers. The
plants are pulled up by
the roots.
The villagers say that
the name Myrtos is derived from
the many large [SYMBOL]
which formerly grew where the
banana groves now are, but
were cut down when the
latter were established.
The village of Myrtos is
said to be less than 100
years old. The church is the
only older building.
The village is very regular
in plan (in contrast to Ana-
toli) with wide streets on
a grid pattern. Most of
the houses appear to be
pre-war at least in part,
though some of the older
ones are in ruins. Most

[10668-10669]

of th[!!!!]em[!!!!]ose in use have glass
to the windows. A few have
pithed roofs with "Roman"
tiles but the rest are flat,
of concrete. They are very
hot inside.
The house at the 12
Apostles (by the Turkish Bridge)
is one large room with doors
on two sides and a window.
The roof is of concrete but
the building is old. Iron bars
to the window. A fireplace
in one corner. Furniture is
a double bed, a table, chairs,
some shelves. The summer
cooking place consists of several
stones outside, a fire being
lighted of sticks. There is
a recess in the wall out-
side for an [!!!!]earthern [SYMBOL]
of about 5 gallons for
water. A bunch of [!!!!]dead
Poterium spinosum, [SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL] (Photini: [SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL]) is stuffed into the
mouth. The house is inhabi-
ted by an elderly couple.
Floor of earth, on which
eater, dregs of wine, and
other liquids are poured.
Window has solid wooden
shutters but no glass.
Chickens come in through
the doors.
The meal (a kind of
parish breakfast with the
parson present after the

[10670-10671]

service) was a copious chicken
stew (containing at least [!!!!]4
fowls for some 12 persons)
with spaghetti and tomatoes.
Preceded by arrack or [SYMBOL]
and accompanied by red
wine. Bread (a spare Commu-
nion loaf) and boiled eggs
and fried cheese-cake.
Photini says the [SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL] is to keep out flies
and geckoes.
The land on the W. bank
of the Myrtos river up to
the Turkish Bridge is highly
cultivated, mainly with groves
of olives and bananas but
with some pomegranates, [!!!!]
[!!!!] almonds, castor-oil, [!!!!]oranges, &c
It is irrigated by an
elaborate system of chan-
nels, beginning with concrete
ducts and ending with
small earthern channels a
few in. wide and deep. They
end in small [!!!!]embanked
areas which may enclose
individual trees. The whole
system has now of course
dried up. [[SYMBOL] 13]
Bananas have suffered
severely apparently from a
freak frost last winter. No
plants have been killed but
the older leaves of most
are dead or reduced to
their midribs, and the
more severely affected plants

[10672-10673]

are much set back. Only
a few have flowered.
Myrtle is frequent
along the larger earthern
watercourses. Small bushes
not flowering.
The mulberries (the
commonest street tree in Crete
including Myrtos) are said
to be planted for [SYMBOL],
silkworms. [[SYMBOL] pronounced dz].
A little frog was seen
late at night in an outdoor
lavatory. About 1 1/2 in. long,
dull dusty pink with big dull
green irregular spots. Rather
quiet but very active when
pursued, hopping vigorously.
Pigs are most unusual
but one was seen at
Myrtos tied to a shed by
one leg.
Stars visible in the
south:
[DIAG]

[10674-10675]

Among the groves of culti-
vated trees behind Myrtos are
small areas of grass [!!!!]behind[!!!!] on
which a few cattle are tethered.
Oranges are often culti-
vated and moderately flourishing.
A large Citrus tree is com-
monly cultivated, especially around
[SYMBOL]. [SYMBOL]. Big lanceolate dark
green leaves with prominent
pinnate veins. Probably a
grapefruit or citron.
Cockroaches were hunted
in the house at night, coming
out after the light had been
put out.
The house has a small
concrete yard surrounded by
the walls of this and other
houses. At intervals of 9in. or
so are nests of tiny black
ants, which pervade everything
including plant-presses, but
seem to do no harm.
The house contains a tap
of good but always lukewarm
water which runs into a con-
crete sink.
A superb edible fish, the
[SYMBOL] or red mullet, is
caught by the local fisherman
when he operates (which is
irregular). Ab[!!!!]ut 8in. long,
laterally flattened, a beautiful
orange colour.
Few cattle or goats were
seen and no sheep. Women
occasionally drive small num-

[10676-10677]

bers of goats out of the village,
it is not clear where to.
There are numerous asses
in the village whose brays are
deafening at most hours ex-
cept between c. 12 and 4 a.m.
They carry large men, often with
luggage or even a second
man. Mules are less common
and horses rare. Only one
or two tractors were seen.
The village is laid out on
a grid plan quite unlike Ana-
toli. There are blocks of about
4 houses separated by wide
streets planted with mulberries.
Houses of stone or concrete
usually with flat concrete roofs
(often without parapets) but
there are a few with "Roman"
tiles. No exposed building tim-
ber. The village is said to
have been destroyed by the
Germans, who shot over 20 of
the men; in fact many of
the buildings appear to be
older than this and there
are a few ornate doorways,
though nothing apparently older
than the later Turkish period.
The church is concrete or
concreted stone and almost fea-
tureless, but with a fine
carved iconostasis.
All doors and shutters, al-
most without exception, appear
older than the present form of
the buildings they are in.

[10678-10679]

ANTONI'S HOUSE
M: magazine great [SYMBOL]
(lit by a skylight)
Antoni's house (used by
us to live in, he having a
second house where he lives)
like [!!!!]most in the village has
no upper floor. (The few
house that do often have only
one room above.) These houses
are very hot, especially at
night; the dust pours in at
night, and the howling of the
land-wind drives away sleep.
There are several derelict
houses in the village, possibly
from wartime destruction.
Numerous balconies and
flat roofs are used for
sitting out on, usually unfenced
with the typical Cretan disre-
gard of heights.

seaward buildings have
collapsed. Few trees planted
around the place, mainly
tamerisks, up to c. 9 in. dia.
The inhabitants are very hospit-
able. On my return I asked for water
and they made me eat & drink with

Both the serpentine outcrop
and the corresponding one on the
other side of the ridge (p.687-8)
strongly resemble the Lizard
"rock heath" and sharp drain-
age probably plays a part. They
are mainly more extreme than in
Cornwall. [SYMBOL] 10 shows the contrast

peared to be in wait for insects
attracted by the lamp. They were
almost motionless but ran
away quickly when approached.
A snake was seen in
Pistacia bushes by the shore
near A[SYMBOL]. [SYMBOL]. Ra-

[10698-10699]

This journey was made
mainly along the coastal path if
any or along the shore. Shore
is shingle & course sand, very
tiring to walk on because
soft. Nowhere wide, sloping
steeply into the sea, disappearing
altogether at the cliffs of [SYMBOL],
[SYMBOL] [SYMBOL], [SYMBOL] and [SYMBOL].
These cliffs are all soft lime-
stone and conglomerate, except
[SYMBOL] which is harder lime-
stone. The soft limestone cliffs
of the coast (and inland in
some of the valleys) are very
loose, eroding, and unclimb-
able. There is a place of
some difficulty on [SYMBOL] [SYMBOL]
which could only be rounded by
wading. Sand and shingle dark
gray. Occasional ledges of
conglomerate eroded by waves
to produce brilliant [!!!!] sections
of coloured pebbels ([SYMBOL] 11).
The inland passage of
[SYMBOL] was quite difficult,
especially on the E. side where
there are several steep eroded
gulleys. A passer-by was
very helpful in finding a
way upward.
The country inland is
similar to that around Myrtos,
but with few trees save olives
and carobs. Pines very local.
Soft limestone predominates.
Only the minutest of dunes,
mainly at [SYMBOL]. [SYMBOL]. [cont. p. 1041

Setaria sp. and Medicago
sativa are used as [SYMBOL] at
Myrtos, i.e. boiled & eaten.
[SYMBOL] is much
used as a building stone
at Myrtos, usually in rubble
walling, including new buil-

Myrtos to Males via Mithi.
Mithi. A village rather like
Mournies but more regular,
with a sizeable square on
a steep slope. Immense plane
trees, one of which is dying.
Sarand[SYMBOL]pigo is a long
serrated ridge from about
538040 northwards. It appears
to consist of coarse sandstone
& conglomerates overlying jasper
or serpentine. It is very eroded
and its cliffs carry almost no
vegetation.
Platanus orientalis is
rare in Crete (in contrast to
N. Greece). A few trees grow
apparently wild in the river
bed at Myrtos. There are several
big trees in the villages, inclu-
ding two giants at [SYMBOL],
of which one is dying.
The common Pulicaria of
the Myrtos plain has no

Below Males:
Quercus pubescens
Smilax
[????] Donax
Q. coccifera
[SYMBOL] = Coridothymus
Quercus pubescens is
very local between Mithi
and Males. Occasional
trees about 30 ft high,
regarded by the inhabitants
as very unusual. The
species was not seen in
the immediate area of
Males.
Q. coccifera is local
between Mithi & Myrtos, [Males]
occasionally a small tree.
Smilax aspera is occas-
ional between Mithi & Myrtos.
Not seen elsewhere in Crete.
The small ants are a
considerable nuisance at
Males: they were very
frequent indoors and were
particularly fond of bales
of herbs spread out to
dry. They are completely
inoffensive.
Many grasshoppers were
seen clustered on asses' muck
near the Turkish Bridge.

[10736-10737]

Males is on a convex
S. facing ridge of land on
which olives and carobs
reach their upper limit (c.
600 m.). On the Christos
slope the land is extensively
terraced but most of the
terraces are unoccupied and
the rest used for cereals.
Elsewhere there are large
areas of pine woods varying
in density but closed on the
less steep slopes.
Ag. [SYMBOL] is apparently
deserted apart from the chapel.
The surrounding olive groves
are maintained.
The olive trees around
Males are much larger than
lower in the valley, with
diameters up to 4 ft. Large
trees are often rotted into
fragments.
East of Males (behind
Ag. [SYMBOL], &c.) are several
limestone escarpments.
Hyoscyamus albus is
frequent at Males.
Peppermint is [SYMBOL].

Figs grow at Males:
they are unusual in the

The journey from the
Turkish Bridge to Males by
bus was an interesting one.
Bus of the type used on
the Myrtos road, smaller than
the main-road buses, very
battered and ancient, by
International Harvester Cor-
poration but with a German
engine. Very full of people
up to Mithi but less full
from then on. One or two
of the passengers were
seasick. The direct distance
is 7km, somewhat lengthened
though not enormously by
bends. The journey took
2 hours with a break in
Mithi for the bus to re-
cover and the passengers
 driver to refresh them-
 selves at a pub.
 The road shows no
 sign of paving and is

[10742-10743]

in most places deeply cam-
bered and with many
boulders fixed or loose.
It is very narrow especially
above Mithi where it squeezes
through the olive groves.
Little more than a good
mule track. It crosses the
Myrtos River and one of
its western tributaries by
fords. The water is now
about 9in. deep and there
is no surface to the ford.
It is said to be imprac-
ticable in the wet season,
when the only way out of
Males is to the E.
Myrtos River.
Has water in it from
somewhere below Males down
to the base of Sarandapigo.
Quite clear, lined with
Vitex & Oleander nearly
up to Males.
Below Sarandapigo the
river breaks through the
serpentines by a remarkable
[SYMBOL], a cleft in the
rocks apparently only a
few inches wide with
vertical sides, through which
the water presumably runs
several feet deep at times.
It is not clear whether
the water at Ay. [SYMBOL]
and Myrtos is derived by
tapping the river.

[10744-10745]

Males.
A large village, very
tight in the middle but
more diffuse towards the
edges. The outer quarters
are reached by streets of
vehicle width (though there
are no vehicles save a few
lorries). The interior, a
rough square of about
1/4 mile, is traversed by
a seemingly quite random
network of lanes 3-6ft
wide, with many anasto-
moses with blind endings.
Paved with cobbles or rude
setts, with steps where steep.
There are at least 7
churches, most with one
bay's width but some with
two. All quite undistinguished
outside with plastered walls
and a bare cemented vault.
Each stands in a narrow
churchyard with a cement
floor.
Houses one-storeyed
except a few with 2 storeys
and occasionally a balcony.
Usually one room, though
probably several units are
lived in by one family
and there are indistinguish-
able buildings for goats &
asses. Roofs always flat,
mostly concrete though
many of earth remain.
Little wood is used ex-

[10746-10747]

cept for doors & shutters.
Some have no window glass.
Cooking is done on
outside hearths of a
few whitewashed stones,
usually in a small court-
yard made where the
street widens but with
no separating wall.
Houses usually have
an internal fireplace, often
in one corner. The chimney
does not project above the
roof. The chimney pot is
literally a [SYMBOL] with
the bottom knocked out and
upended.
The houses are always
plastered outside and usu-
ally whitewashed.

Much of the land in the
Myrtos valley below Males is
cultivated, with great olive
groves.
