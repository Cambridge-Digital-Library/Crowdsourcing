April 19 cont.   [DIAG] 
Another badger sett was
discovered in Overhall, on the
outside bank of the fosse around
the central motte. 12 open
holes were found. A few
more had been stopped some
time ago and not reopened.
Some are under tree roots.
Some have large mounds
of excavated material under
them, including one which
runs out into the moat.
The soil is very sticky
boulder clay and there are
many paw marks made
by the animals clutching,
and usually slipping on
the near-vertical sides of
the burrows. Hairs were
[6506-6507]
also found.
A hare was seen at
Overhall and another near 
Childerley.
Two badger-like holes
were found in Childerley Dyke.
They were not stopped up
despite the recent coppicing
of the dyke. No definite tra[????]
Viburnum lantana grows
in a hedge near Childerley
Dyke. It is well advanced
and near flowering.
Coprin[????] micaceus was
found on a rotten log in
Overhall.
Primula elatior grows
in the lower part of
Overhall Plantation, where
there is much standing
water,as well as on the
higher ground and the
earthworks. There is no ob-
vious difference in vigour.
It also grows sporadically
in a recent plantation at
Thoro'fare Spinney (341624)
a hundred yards at most
from a population of cowslips.
It might be worth while
looking for hybrids here.
April 20.
An owl was seen sitting
in one of the lime trees on
Queens' Piece near a sodium
street-light after dusk. It
picked up something from
off the grass. Not eared.
April 21.
A mallard is nesting in
[6508-6509]
a flower-bed under a window
of A staircase, New Court
(the same place as last
year).
April 22.
The starlings seem to have
deserted the eggs, but are
still visiting the loft from
time to time.
April 23.
Bats are frequent.
April 24.
Eversden Wood is a
coppice with standards from
which the standards (oaks)
have, apparently with only
one exception been cut
down about 1930. Hazel
is much the commonest
coppice plant.

The Tetraphis stump is
different from most of the
others in having been cut
with the saw only instead
of the axe and saw. The
surface is cheesey in consis-
tency.
1. Panaeolus campanulatus.
Few on a grassy track

2. Polyporus squ[????]mosus. one
young one.
3. Ganoderma lucidum. Many
old ones around an oak stump.
4. Daedalea quercina. Old ones
are abundant on oak stumps.
The wood is very
wet, with much standing water.
Oxlips are generally
abundant, but small and
rarely flowering. The mos-
ses are definitely paludal.
There are small areas of
bluebells and mercury
in the drier places. The
wood in places is fenny
in character, with much
[6514-6515]

[DIAG]

[6516-6517]
birch. The undergrowth is
generally open.
By the pond at "Ross's
Farm" (actually a spinney)
a single plant of a
hybrid Primula with very
bullate leaves (probably
veris x vulgaris) and large
primrose-yellow corolla
was found.
The hedge leading from
this farm to the wood
is an old belt, with
bluebells, Arum, and Daphne.
An old elm in the
hedge with deeply fissured
bark was covered with
many ladybirds, mostly
2-spot, but with several
varients, some of which are
[DIAG]
shown.
Paris was found in
a wet place in the S.W.
part of the wood, poorly
developed and not flowering.
One old oak remains
near the N.W. ride. It is
about 6ft diam., the trunk
about 8ft high, with several
heavy branches. It has
been completely split, ap-
parently by explosive (some-
body seems to have been
trying to blow up some
large elm stumps on the Mare
[6518-6519]
Ways. One half has been
completely detatched, but
about a third of the trunk
is still on its roots, though
it has fallen over. The
interior is full of a soft
brown rot (like Fistul[????]). About 3in.
thick of sound wood re-
mains on the outside.
Rabbits' bones were found
embedded in the rotten
wood. Orthodontium grows
abundantly on what
was formerly the outside
and crown of the trunk.
In the marshy part
near where Tetraphis was
found, small nearly black
mice were seen hopping
about in the grass. They
could be heard talking. Their
voices were very like grass-
hoppers but more inter-
mittent. There was much
variation between individuals.
Cirsium eriophorum is
frequent on the verges of
the top of Wimpole Road,
Great Eversden, near its
junction with the Mare
Way, 353526.
At the N.W. corner of E-
versden Wood is a small
area of scrub, apparently
an abandoned garden.
There is an active
badger sett by the bank
of one of the streams (of
Overhall) in a rather
dry part of the wood. Six
[6520-6521]
open holes were found, with
much fresh excavation,
abundant foot-print, and
detached hairs. There was
no sign of disturbance.
Several small willows,
including some tending to
S. repens, were found in a
marshy part of the wood.
The boulder clay on the
Mare Way, 356524, is ap-
parently about 10ft thick in
the middle. It contains
many erratics. Coal is
frequent.
Rabbits were not seen
in the wood, but there is a
small warren in a heap of
ashes on the Mare Way.
Angelica and Carex flacca
occur in wet places on the
rides.
April 25.
Polyporus squamosus. A
new one near a stub-end
on one of the planes in
Sidgwick Avenue, though all
dead branches have recently
been removed from the trees.
April 26
Polyporus squamosus. One
on the ancient elm in the
bus station.
April 27.
Two bats were seen
chasing one another in
the college. They flew at
high speed in small
circles, sometimes only a
few ft from the ground,
[6522-6523]
often passing over rooftops.
They made intermittent
(about once a second)
rasping squeaks, almost
inaudible.
April 28.
The New Court duck
is still sitting.
April 29.
An apparently hiber-
nating hedghog is reported
to have been found in
the Anderson hut at Norwich.
April 30.
The starlings are still about
in the attic at Leckhampton.
May 1.
The duck in the New
Court hatched 13 ducklings.
These were marched off to
the river through St Cath-
arine's and Queens' under
the direction of Mr Garth
Ma[????]e.
May 2. Hayley Wood.
A cuckoo was heard per-
sistently in the wood.
A nightingale was also heard.
Viola reichenbachiana is
more common than V. rivin-
iana. Puccinia violae was
found on it.
Several rabbit holes
were found in the W. half
of Hayley Wood, including
some in the second coppicing
plot. Some are only a few
in. above the water table.
Mole-hills ae also nu-
merous in rather wet
[6524-6525]
ground.
The general water-table
in Hayley is slightly lower
than at Eversden and
much higher than Overhall
(except at the bottom). In
the Triangle, water stands
about 1ft deep in the 
plowing hollows. The water
has risen greatly in the
clearing since last visited.
Deer tracks and drop-
pings are frequent.
1. Tremella mesenterica. One on
hazel.
2. Hypholoma fasciculare.
Few on a stump.
3. Polyporus squamosus.
Small ones are quite frequent.
Nowellia is abundant,
though very difficult
to find when wet because
its dark colour matches 
the wet substrate.
Mercury is most
abundant in the dry
N.W. quadrant.
Various willows occur
by the small ponds along
the railway, but S. repens
was not seen.
Filipendula ulmaria
forms small pure stands
in the undergrowth in places.
Oxlips are very abun-
dant, though not quite so
dense or flowering so freely as
at Overall ([????] Eversden). No
primrose rust was found
