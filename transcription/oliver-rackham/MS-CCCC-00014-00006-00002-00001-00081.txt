April 19 cont.   [DIAG] 
Another badger sett was
discovered in Overhall, on the
outside bank of the fosse around
the central motte. 12 open
holes were found. A few
more had been stopped some
time ago and not reopened.
Some are under tree roots.
Some have large mounds
of excavated material under
them, including one which
runs out into the moat.
The soil is very sticky
boulder clay and there are
many paw marks made
by the animals clutching,
and usually slipping on
the near-vertical sides of
the burrows. Hairs were
[6506-6507]
also found.
A hare was seen at
Overhall and another near 
Childerley.
Two badger-like holes
were found in Childerley Dyke.
They were not stopped up
despite the recent coppicing
of the dyke. No definite tra[????]
Viburnum lantana grows
in a hedge near Childerley
Dyke. It is well advanced
and near flowering.
Coprin[????] micaceus was
found on a rotten log in
Overhall.
Primula elatior grows
in the lower part of
Overhall Plantation, where
there is much standing
water,as well as on the
higher ground and the
earthworks. There is no ob-
vious difference in vigour.
It also grows sporadically
in a recent plantation at
Thoro'fare Spinney (341624)
a hundred yards at most
from a population of cowslips.
It might be worth while
looking for hybrids here.
April 20.
An owl was seen sitting
in one of the lime trees on
Queens' Piece near a sodium
street-light after dusk. It
picked up something from
off the grass. Not eared.
April 21.
A mallard is nesting in
[6508-6509]
a flower-bed under a window
of A staircase, New Court
(the same place as last
year).
April 22.
The starlings seem to have
deserted the eggs, but are
still visiting the loft from
time to time.
April 23.
Bats are frequent.
April 24.
Eversden Wood is a
coppice with standards from
which the standards (oaks)
have, apparently with only
one exception been cut
down about 1930. Hazel
is much the commonest
coppice plant.

The Tetraphis stump is
different from most of the
others in having been cut
with the saw only instead
of the axe and saw. The
surface is cheesey in consis-
tency.

4. Daedalea quercina. Old ones
are abundant on oak stumps.
The wood is very
wet, with much standing water.
Oxlips are generally
abundant, but small and
rarely flowering. The mos-
ses are definitely paludal.
There are small areas of
bluebells and mercury
in the drier places. The
wood in places is fenny
in character, with much
