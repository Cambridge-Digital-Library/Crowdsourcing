The following
notes, refer to the 
Devil's Ditch, New-
market Heath.
Conium is 
scarce mainly near
the Reach end.
In an eroded
place not far from
Reach, the structure
was seen to consist

humus, forming

Anemone pulsa-

It grows in clumps
about 1ft diam.
of which there are

short turf. The 
bulk of the clumps
are near the top
of the vallum and
on the S.W. side, 
thoguh the plants

N.E.side. The
clumps are in
two groups. One

[DIAG]
Two
gourd
seedlings
were found
to have 
arrested
growth
apparently because
the testa, instead of
being detached by 
the hypocotyl peg,
remained holding
the cotyledons together.
On removing the
testa, small well-
-developed WS were
found between the
cotyledons.
All the gourds
were planted today.
[3424-3425]
They were inserted
in small groups in 
little mounds of
compost.
Several greenflies
were found on the
Zinnias, though the
latter have always
been kept indoors.
There are many
plants of the Mauve
Poppy, especially on
recently disturbed 
ground.
A few Eschscholzia
seedlings have been found.

Several dead bran-
ches, one a very
large one, were

Four sucklrs were 
removed from the S.
D[????]y Maid.
Laurocerasus WS

almond smell when
cut.
There is a young

A large limb was out 
cut off the "BoB". 
For some years it
had not borne any

partly dead except 
for one large one
which was living 
though with small
browned WS and 
no frs. The back

was [!!!!] firmly attached, sunken,

cracked. The dead cortex was [!!!!] brown

sometimes obliquely 
demarcated from

The small elder in 
the Andersen border
was destroyed.
The little rose 
S.W. of E de H was
[3434-3435]
destroyed. It was
severly attacked by 
Coniothyrium in c.1952
and has since pro-
duced only stock
shoots. On digging
up, it was found
that the old stock
and roots were 
entirely dead and
decayed, the living
part being a small
lateral branch of 
the stock growing
upwards with roots
at its base.
The other rose 
attacked at the same
time, N.W. of E de H
still has a living
graft. Though not
large, this has flowered
from time to time as
now. Fl. closely resem-
bling that of Anon.

are no certain dif-
ferences between the

The first fl. of
one of the gourd

It was [SYMB]. The

similarly harvested.
Nicky is active
