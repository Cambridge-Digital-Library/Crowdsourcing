                     1969]
 Hintlesham Wood cont.
 1. standards well preserved
 (though regenerating badly).
 2.  Little sign of large coppice
 other than lime.  Ash cut
 sporadically if at all:  no large
 stools.
 3. Small coppice cut sporadically 
 and not recently.  No sign of
 regular coppicing.
 4. Soil variation of vegetation
 is towards the most acid
 end of the range, and is
 much less variable than in
 the Bradfield woods.  Mainly 
 oak-birch-bramble type: oak-
 birch-bramble and Anemone
 -oxalis variants occur in 
 small areas only. No broom.
 5. Drainage variation towards
 
 [2246-2247]
 2246
 the drier end of the range,
 but with wetter pools.
 6. Lime present on a much
 larger scale than at Bradfield.
 Stsandards and large coppice.
 Semi-regular large coppice
 may possibly have been in-
 creased by planting, but the
 species is undoubtedly native.
 Taxonomically the lime is
 even less extreme T. cordata
 than at Bradfield.  Leaves 
 of large trees are often obliquely
 truncate at base, though all
 trees have proportion of cordate
 leaves.  Large trees have many
 epidormic shoots like the hybrid
 lime.  Lime appears to be
 confined to the N. corner of 
 the woods.
 2247
 
 7.  Cherry is locally a major
 woodland tree and occurs as
 large standards.
 8.  Hornbeam pesent as two
 big small-coppice stools on the 
 edge of a part of the wood
 cleared in the last century
 (Schofield's report implies that it 
is more abundant).
9.  Birch appears to be entirely
B. pubescens.  (Mainly pubescens
at Bradfield.) Occasionally once-
-cut.
10.  Copnsiderable variety of
elms, mainly because of 
planting in the Handle.
12.  Alder apparently absent.
13.  Holly apparently absent.
14. Tree willows apparently absent.
 
[2248-2249]
2248
15.Frangula apparently absent.
16.Hawthorn more frequent
than at Bradfield and both
species present.
17.Bluebell very local as at
Bradfield.
18.A veey large Helleborus
colony.  Plants rather widely
spaced, in dense shade:  at the
edge of a bracken area, with
little ground vegetation and no
mercury;  in all of which it con-
trasts with that in Buff Wood.
19. Primrose the only Primula.
20.  Mercury local.
21. Brambles dominant over
the greater part of the wood.
22. Phosphatic plants rare.
23. Apparently no Allium ursinum.
24. Large Carex very rare: C.
2249
pseudocyperus the only species
identified.
25. No Conopodium seen.
26. Old boundary partly sinuous
and partly zigzag.
27. Earthworks remarkably weak.
28. No boundary pollards seen.
29. No evidence of internal
clearings, except for prospect,
30. Ride system is clear evi-
dence of former extent.
31. No ivy on ground except
in Handle.
[2250-2251]

Ramsey Wood.
[SYMBOL] feartures common with
Hintlesham Wood (H).
[SYMBOL] 1. Standards well preserved
(though regenerating badly).
2. No regular lrge coppice.
A very few marginal stools:
chestnut once-cuts in S. exten-
sion:  one or two big elm stools.
3. No sign of regular small 
coppice.
4. Soil vegetation types acid,
and even more restricted than
in Hintlesham.  Only the oak-
-birch-bramble type seen.
5. Drainage variation towards the
drier end of the range.
6. Lime present as occasional 
marginal stools only (cf Bradfield)
7. Cherry very rare, as small
2251
trees only.
8. No hornbeam.
[SYMBOL] 9. Birch entirely pubescens.
10. Variety of elms, partly
because of planting in the
N. addition, but including
a very few big Ulmus glabra
stools.
[SYMBOL] Sallow infrequent or absent.

features such as corner mounds
well preserved.
[SYMBOL] No boundary pollards seen 
(though boundary stools are 
frequent)
[SYMBOL]  No evidence of internsl
clearings.
[SYMBOL] 31. No ivy on ground except

Haughley Oak.
Stands in the middle of 
a small grass field, directly
in front of New Bell's Farm.
It does not appear to form
part of an old hedge line.
  Lady Barker says it has
never been fertilized, although
it is remarkably healthy for
so large a tree and shows no
sign of dying at rhe top.
She regards it as a survivor 
from the primary forest.

   Coton.
   By the Coton footpath are two
strips of fallow land of about
2 acres each.  One is covered
with Picrus echioides:  a stand
of plants covering about 1/4
of the ground and atanding
c. 4 ft high.  There are also
small plants of Epilobium
hirsutum in flower.  The land
was cultivated last year, but
there are large stands of
this plant in nearby diches.
Bartsia Odontites occurs in 
prodigious quantities on the
other fallow land.
   The large Irpex which
grew last year on a decrepit

2278
apple tree at Coton was
annual and shows no sign of
activity this year.
   The ground at Coton is
now cracked into polygons
with joints up to 1 in. wide.
  There are two dead
greengage trees in the garden
at Coton, each about 10ft
high and 9in. diam., each
densely invested with ivy in-
cluding a large mass over
the top. In the dry weather
recently, one of them spontan-
eously toppled over and
the other leaned to one side
and was found to be held
up solely by the ivy.  They
were both rotted at the
2279
base and it is assumed that
shrinkage of the clay loosened
them.
   A new sporophore of Fornes
pomaceus has appeared on
a living outlying branch of
th old russet apple.
   Several of the apple trees
at Coton are heavily infected
with canker, but as long as
they remain vigorous only
small branches are lost.
  White aphids are particu-
larly severe on a beech hedge.

                        [SYMBOL] 26.
Genista tinctoria.  Slightly later
flowering in the Glade.

A sizeable branch fell 
probably yesterday off an
oak near the S.E. boundary
2283
of the 1970 plot.  The
weather had been dry
and fairly calm.  Branch
some 6 cm dia. with much
foliage. There was a large
old decayed snag which
had greatly reduced the
cross-section at the point of
breakage, especially as
a [????stake] ran down from it.
Little recent fungal activity
and no sign of wet-wood.
  The whole wood is now
exceptionally dry.  There are
small soft patches in the main
ride and in the N. section,
but no water seen anywhere
eccept in ponds.  "Black holes"

[2284-2285]
2284
in coppice plots now completely
hard and overgrown.  N. Section
pond quite dry.  Main pond down
only about 1 ft from maximum.
  Much of the mercury in the
E. and S. sections is wilted. [SYMBOL] 26
  Honeysuckle is often wilted
in the N. section.  [SYMBOL] 27.
  Cracks are open up to c.
1 1/4" wide.
  Maples are the most
severely affected standard trees:
several are dead or dying.
Ashes are also in bad condi-
tion:  even old standards have 
thin tops with many dead
branches, although the surviving
leaves appear to be turgid.
   Numerous butterflies were
2285
seen at the Roundabout: whites,
peacocks, occasional brimstones.
  A marsh-tit was seen
hanging upside-down on a 
head of Cirsium palustre.
  A tree-creeper was seen
on the burry trunk of an oak
at the Roundabout.
  The Glade is tall grass
(Deschampsia and Brachypod-
ium) with no sign of grazing.
  Hazels, particularly those
coppiced, are showing tinges
of yellow and brown in their
leaves, presumably from drought.
  Growth of coppice ash is
quite good, particularly in the
1969 plot.  Deer grazing has
so far been light.

 Coppicing.
   Areas of 1/4 acre cut probably
 in 1966, 1967, and i968, none
 previously for many years.

after coppicing.
Features.
1.  Well-preserved woodland
structure with many remaining
standards.
2. Remarkably fine boundary
earthworks.  No internal banks.
3. Unusually large oak and
maple standards, the latter pos-
sibly the finest in Cambs.
4. Commercially coppiced on a
2317
very small scale.
5. No exotics.
6. Oxlip only.
7. Birch apparently all pubescens.
8. Hawthorn: both rather rsre, rather
more [!!!!pubescens] monogyna.
9. Epipactis.
10. Some signs of acid areas - 
Holeus mollis, potentilla reptans -
but less marked than in
Sparrow's Grove, and no heathland
indicators.
11. Zonation of the eastern
type: mercury and oxlip overlap,
no bluebell zone.
12. Several eastern species absent:
Geum rivasle, Euphorbia amygdal-
oides.
13. Mentha arvensis.

  The hedge to the N.E. of
this lane hasd been felled to
the ground.  That to the S.E.
is intact though scorched.  The
lane is not much used by
vehicles.
  This lane goes up a fairly
steep hill, unlike CD which is
level.
  Mercury occurs on both
sides, and has not been much
damaged by the cutting of

Wet-wood.
  Between A & B by the
Stour is a row of small
elms recently damaged by
bush-clesaring.  An axe cut
in one has penetrated to a 
wet-wood zone in the heart.
A shake exposed thereby has
exuded flu9d in the last few
days.  No shakes extending
to the outside were seen.
-----------------------------
Oxlips occur in small
numbers (total c. 40 plants),
mainly on the S.W. side and a few on
the lane itself.  There may 
be more in the S.W. hedge

itself. Those on the S.W.
side are tall, with erect leaves,
and have formed abundant
fruit.  No young plants seen.
Those in the lane are less
robust. Those on the N.E. side
grew on bare ground in the
shade of the hedge, and have
small rosettes of small leaves
like those in excessive shade
in a wood.
  These oxlips resemble
morphologically the "normal"
non-woodland form of Hay-
ley railway and Eltisley, ra-
ther than the extreme form
of Dickleburgh.
2329
IA.
  A remarkable area of scrub,
apparently on the site of a small
field.  (John Faulkner says it is
charity land which there is some
legal objection to reclaiming).
  Mainly Crataegus monogyna
and Prunus spinosa, forming 
a dense canopy with room
to walk underneath.  Too dark
for much vegetation: mostly
bare ground.  Mercury occurs
in the old hedge-bank to
Clamps Lane and a few yards
into the grove.  No oxlips.  The
lane side is fringed by tall
dense nettles and Epilobiunm hir-
sutum.

AH.
  At A the lane fords the 
Stour, a stream some 4 ft
wide in a gravel bed, not
too eutrophic.  The Stour con-
tinues along the S. side to-
wards H, but the lane is
very wet and has an attrsc-
tive tall fen community.  Big
willows alongside snd a tract
of undrained ground on either
side.
GF.
  This area is disturbed and
there is no sign of the parish
boundary, nor of the oak on the
O.S.

  Dullingham Park contains some
fine elms but no trees of particular
note, and is probably fairly recent.
