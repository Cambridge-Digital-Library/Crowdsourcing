                     1969]
 Hintlesham Wood cont.
 1. standards well preserved
 (though regenerating badly).
 2.  Little sign of large coppice
 other than lime.  Ash cut
 sporadically if at all:  no large
 stools.
 3. Small coppice cut sporadically 
 and not recently.  No sign of
 regular coppicing.
 4. Soil variation of vegetation
 is towards the most acid
 end of the range, and is
 much less variable than in
 the Bradfield woods.  Mainly 
 oak-birch-bramble type: oak-
 birch-bramble and Anemone
 -oxalis variants occur in 
 small areas only. No broom.
 5. Drainage variation towards
 
 [2246-2247]
 2246
 the drier end of the range,
 but with wetter pools.
 6. Lime present on a much
 larger scale than at Bradfield.
 Stsandards and large coppice.
 Semi-regular large coppice
 may possibly have been in-
 creased by planting, but the
 species is undoubtedly native.
 Taxonomically the lime is
 even less extreme T. cordata
 than at Bradfield.  Leaves 
 of large trees are often obliquely
 truncate at base, though all
 trees have proportion of cordate
 leaves.  Large trees have many
 epidormic shoots like the hybrid
 lime.  Lime appears to be
 confined to the N. corner of 
 the woods.
 2247
 
 7.  Cherry is locally a major
 woodland tree and occurs as
 large standards.
 8.  Hornbeam pesent as two
 big small-coppice stools on the 
 edge of a part of the wood
 cleared in the last century
 (Schofield's report implies that it 
is more abundant).
9.  Birch appears to be entirely
B. pubescens.  (Mainly pubescens
at Bradfield.) Occasionally once-
-cut.
10.  Copnsiderable variety of
elms, mainly because of 
planting in the Handle.
12.  Alder apparently absent.
13.  Holly apparently absent.
14. Tree willows apparently absent.
 
[2248-2249]
2248
15.Frangula apparently absent.
16.Hawthorn more frequent
than at Bradfield and both
species present.
17.Bluebell very local as at
Bradfield.
18.A veey large Helleborus
colony.  Plants rather widely
spaced, in dense shade:  at the
edge of a bracken area, with
little ground vegetation and no
mercury;  in all of which it con-
trasts with that in Buff Wood.
19. Primrose the only Primula.
20.  Mercury local.
21. Brambles dominant over
the greater part of the wood.
22. Phosphatic plants rare.
23. Apparently no Allium ursinum.
24. Large Carex very rare: C.
2249
pseudocyperus the only species
identified.
25. No Conopodium seen.
26. Old boundary partly sinuous
and partly zigzag.
27. Earthworks remarkably weak.
28. No boundary pollards seen.
29. No evidence of internal
clearings, except for prospect,
30. Ride system is clear evi-
dence of former extent.
31. No ivy on ground except
in Handle.
[2250-2251]
2250
Ramsey Wood.
[SYMBOL] feartures common with
Hintlesham Wood (H).
[SYMBOL] 1. Standards well preserved
(though regenerating badly).
2. No regular lrge coppice.
A very few marginal stools:
chestnut once-cuts in S. exten-
sion:  one or two big elm stools.
3. No sign of regular small 
coppice.
4. Soil vegetation types acid,
and even more restricted than
in Hintlesham.  Only the oak-
-birch-bramble type seen.
5. Drainage variation towards the
drier end of the range.
6. Lime present as occasional 
marginal stools only (cf Bradfield)
7. Cherry very rare, as small
2251
trees only.
8. No hornbeam.
[SYMBOL] 9. Birch entirely pubescens.
10. Variety of elms, partly
because of planting in the
N. addition, but including
a very few big Ulmus glabra
stools.
[SYMBOL] Sallow infrequent or absent.
[SYMBOL] Alder         [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] Holly         [SYMBOL] apparently absent
[SYMBOL] Tree willow   [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] Frangula      [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] Hawthorn more frequent
than at Bradfield and bot
species present.
17. No bluebell.
18. No Helleborus.
[SYMBOL] Primrose the only Primula.
[2252-2253]
2252
[SYMBOL] Mercury local.
[SYMBOL] 21. Brambles dominant over
thre grreater part of the wood.
[SYMBOL] 22. Phosphatic plants rare.
[SYMBOL] 23. Apparently no Allium.
[SYMBOL] 24. Apparently no big Carex.
[SYMBOL] 25. No Conopodium seen.
26. Old boundary very complex
and partly sinuous.
27. Earthworks strong in places,
features such as corner mounds
well preserved.
[SYMBOL] No boundary pollards seen 
(though boundary stools are 
frequent)
[SYMBOL]  No evidence of internsl
clearings.
[SYMBOL] 31. No ivy on ground except
near Hintlesham Handle.
2253
32. Well-defined orchard with
Rosa rubiginosa and several
relict plants.
33. Clematis present. [SYMBOL]
