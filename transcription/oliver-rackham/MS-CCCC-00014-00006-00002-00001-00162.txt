                     1969]
 Hintlesham Wood cont.
 1. standards well preserved
 (though regenerating badly).
 2.  Little sign of large coppice
 other than lime.  Ash cut
 sporadically if at all:  no large
 stools.
 3. Small coppice cut sporadically 
 and not recently.  No sign of
 regular coppicing.
 4. Soil variation of vegetation
 is towards the most acid
 end of the range, and is
 much less variable than in
 the Bradfield woods.  Mainly 
 oak-birch-bramble type: oak-
 birch-bramble and Anemone
 -oxalis variants occur in 
 small areas only. No broom.
 5. Drainage variation towards
 
 [2246-2247]
 2246
 the drier end of the range,
 but with wetter pools.
 6. Lime present on a much
 larger scale than at Bradfield.
 Stsandards and large coppice.
 Semi-regular large coppice
 may possibly have been in-
 creased by planting, but the
 species is undoubtedly native.
 Taxonomically the lime is
 even less extreme T. cordata
 than at Bradfield.  Leaves 
 of large trees are often obliquely
 truncate at base, though all
 trees have proportion of cordate
 leaves.  Large trees have many
 epidormic shoots like the hybrid
 lime.  Lime appears to be
 confined to the N. corner of 
 the woods.
 2247
 
 7.  Cherry is locally a major
 woodland tree and occurs as
 large standards.
 8.  Hornbeam pesent as two
 big small-coppice stools on the 
 edge of a part of the wood
 cleared in the last century
 (Schofield's report implies that it 
is more abundant).
9.  Birch appears to be entirely
B. pubescens.  (Mainly pubescens
at Bradfield.) Occasionally once-
-cut.
10.  Copnsiderable variety of
elms, mainly because of 
planting in the Handle.
12.  Alder apparently absent.
13.  Holly apparently absent.
14. Tree willows apparently absent.
 
[2248-2249]
2248
15.Frangula apparently absent.
16.Hawthorn more frequent
than at Bradfield and both
species present.
17.Bluebell very local as at
Bradfield.
18.A veey large Helleborus
colony.  Plants rather widely
spaced, in dense shade:  at the
edge of a bracken area, with
little ground vegetation and no
mercury;  in all of which it con-
trasts with that in Buff Wood.
19. Primrose the only Primula.
20.  Mercury local.
21. Brambles dominant over
the greater part of the wood.
22. Phosphatic plants rare.
23. Apparently no Allium ursinum.
24. Large Carex very rare: C.
2249
pseudocyperus the only species
identified.
25. No Conopodium seen.
26. Old boundary partly sinuous
and partly zigzag.
27. Earthworks remarkably weak.
28. No boundary pollards seen.
29. No evidence of internal
clearings, except for prospect,
30. Ride system is clear evi-
dence of former extent.
31. No ivy on ground except
in Handle.
[2250-2251]
2250
Ramsey Wood.
[SYMBOL] feartures common with
Hintlesham Wood (H).
[SYMBOL] 1. Standards well preserved
(though regenerating badly).
2. No regular lrge coppice.
A very few marginal stools:
chestnut once-cuts in S. exten-
sion:  one or two big elm stools.
3. No sign of regular small 
coppice.
4. Soil vegetation types acid,
and even more restricted than
in Hintlesham.  Only the oak-
-birch-bramble type seen.
5. Drainage variation towards the
drier end of the range.
6. Lime present as occasional 
marginal stools only (cf Bradfield)
7. Cherry very rare, as small
2251
trees only.
8. No hornbeam.
[SYMBOL] 9. Birch entirely pubescens.
10. Variety of elms, partly
because of planting in the
N. addition, but including
a very few big Ulmus glabra
stools.
[SYMBOL] Sallow infrequent or absent.

[2252-2253]
2252
[SYMBOL] Mercury local.
[SYMBOL] 21. Brambles dominant over
thre grreater part of the wood.
[SYMBOL] 22. Phosphatic plants rare.
[SYMBOL] 23. Apparently no Allium.
[SYMBOL] 24. Apparently no big Carex.
[SYMBOL] 25. No Conopodium seen.
26. Old boundary very complex
and partly sinuous.
27. Earthworks strong in places,
features such as corner mounds
well preserved.
[SYMBOL] No boundary pollards seen 
(though boundary stools are 
frequent)
[SYMBOL]  No evidence of internsl
clearings.
[SYMBOL] 31. No ivy on ground except
near Hintlesham Handle.
2253
32. Well-defined orchard with
Rosa rubiginosa and several
relict plants.
33. Clematis present. [SYMBOL]

are steep and densely over-
hung with scrub.

There is still much stan-
ding water on rides in the
2259
woods, especially in tractor ruts.
Iris pseudocorus is flowering in

July 10
Haughley Oak.
Stands in the middle of 
a small grass field, directly
in front of New Bell's Farm.
It does not appear to form
part of an old hedge line.
  Lady Barker says it has
never been fertilized, although
it is remarkably healthy for
so large a tree and shows no
sign of dying at rhe top.
She regards it as a survivor 
from the primary forest.

Hayley Wood Open Day.
  Meeting with Mr [G.F. Hughes]
of Ivy Cottage, Little Gransden.

One Mrs Slater, of 9

said in conversation that she

[2262-2263]

had rescued a certain plant
from the Forestry Commission's
activities in Brampton Wood
and planted it in the New
Ride Area.
She did not  [DIAG]

are exceptionally hard.

Iris foetidissima.  One plant
with dc. 12 shoots, none flowering.
At the foot of an ash stool,
c. 50 yards in, about half
way from the S.W. to the

it "bird-food" and says it
was frmerly more abundant,
having been planted for this
purpose.

   Coton.
   By the Coton footpath are two
strips of fallow land of about
2 acres each.  One is covered
with Picrus echioides:  a stand
of plants covering about 1/4
of the ground and atanding
c. 4 ft high.  There are also
small plants of Epilobium
hirsutum in flower.  The land
was cultivated last year, but
there are large stands of
this plant in nearby diches.
Bartsia Odontites occurs in 
prodigious quantities on the
other fallow land.
   The large Irpex which
grew last year on a decrepit

[2278-2279]
2278
apple tree at Coton was
annual and shows no sign of
activity this year.
   The ground at Coton is
now cracked into polygons
with joints up to 1 in. wide.
  There are two dead
greengage trees in the garden
at Coton, each about 10ft
high and 9in. diam., each
densely invested with ivy in-
cluding a large mass over
the top. In the dry weather
recently, one of them spontan-
eously toppled over and
the other leaned to one side
and was found to be held
up solely by the ivy.  They
were both rotted at the
2279
base and it is assumed that
shrinkage of the clay loosened
them.
   A new sporophore of Fornes
pomaceus has appeared on
a living outlying branch of
th old russet apple.
   Several of the apple trees
at Coton are heavily infected
with canker, but as long as
they remain vigorous only
small branches are lost.
  White aphids are particu-
larly severe on a beech hedge.

Hayley Wood (Dr & Mrs
Litchfield).
  In the North

Armoracia - by cottage
2-3 plants.

Tragopogon - by level crossing
one plant near Campanula.
Centraurium minus - abundant

Polyporus sulfurens.  Fine sporo-
phores on the top of an oak stump.
                        [SYMBOL] 26.
Genista tinctoria.  Slightly later
flowering in the Glade.

A sizeable branch fell 
probably yesterday off an
oak near the S.E. boundary
2283
of the 1970 plot.  The
weather had been dry
and fairly calm.  Branch
some 6 cm dia. with much
foliage. There was a large
old decayed snag which
had greatly reduced the
cross-section at the point of
breakage, especially as
a [????stake] ran down from it.
Little recent fungal activity
and no sign of wet-wood.
  The whole wood is now
exceptionally dry.  There are
small soft patches in the main
ride and in the N. section,
but no water seen anywhere
eccept in ponds.  "Black holes"

[2284-2285]
2284
in coppice plots now completely
hard and overgrown.  N. Section
pond quite dry.  Main pond down
only about 1 ft from maximum.
  Much of the mercury in the
E. and S. sections is wilted. [SYMBOL] 26
  Honeysuckle is often wilted
in the N. section.  [SYMBOL] 27.
  Cracks are open up to c.
1 1/4" wide.
  Maples are the most
severely affected standard trees:
several are dead or dying.
Ashes are also in bad condi-
tion:  even old standards have 
thin tops with many dead
branches, although the surviving
leaves appear to be turgid.
   Numerous butterflies were
2285
seen at the Roundabout: whites,
peacocks, occasional brimstones.
  A marsh-tit was seen
hanging upside-down on a 
head of Cirsium palustre.
  A tree-creeper was seen
on the burry trunk of an oak
at the Roundabout.
  The Glade is tall grass
(Deschampsia and Brachypod-
ium) with no sign of grazing.
  Hazels, particularly those
coppiced, are showing tinges
of yellow and brown in their
leaves, presumably from drought.
  Growth of coppice ash is
quite good, particularly in the
1969 plot.  Deer grazing has
so far been light.

[12286-12287]
2286
  Oxlip leaves are still green
but often very wilted.
  No fresh deer footmarks
were seen.

2.  Pleurotus cornucopiae
