 Hintlesham Wood cont.
 1. standards well preserved
 (though regenerating badly).
 2.  Little sign of large coppice
 other than lime.  Ash cut
 sporadically if at all:  no large
 stools.
 3. Small coppice cut sporadically 
 and not recently.  No sign of
 regular coppicing.
 4. Soil variation of vegetation
 is towards the most acid
 end of the range, and is
 much less variable than in
 the Bradfield woods.  Mainly 
 oak-birch-bramble type: oak-
 birch-bramble and Anemone
 -oxalis variants occur in 
 small areas only. No broom.
 5. Drainage variation towards
 
 [2246-2247]
 2246
 the drier end of the range,
 but with wetter pools.
 6. Lime present on a much
 larger scale than at Bradfield.
 Stsandards and large coppice.
 Semi-regular large coppice
 may possibly have been in-
 creased by planting, but the
 species is undoubtedly native.
 Taxonomically the lime is
 even less extreme T. cordata
 than at Bradfield.  Leaves 
 of large trees are often obliquely
 truncate at base, though all
 trees have proportion of cordate
 leaves.  Large trees have many
 epidormic shoots like the hybrid
 lime.  Lime appears to be
 confined to the N. corner of 
 the woods.
