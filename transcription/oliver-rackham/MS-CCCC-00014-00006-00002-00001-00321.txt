Left house was evidently built
as a Wealden. Hsll had one
bsy shortened to form a chimney-
bay for an original chimney,
Ground-floor of parlour end was
evidently  a shop.  Door & screens
passage were probably in the
buttery cross-wing, behind the
5041
chimney but no evidence
of them survives. This was altered,
early in the house's history, by inser-
ting a floor in the hall and csrrying 
the jetty to connect both ends. The
work was done in the style of the
original but without the pilaster
strips.
   The right-hand house, originally
of 3 storeys, probsbly once exten-
ded eastwards over the site of
the left-hand house. it is prob. noy
much earlier; the ground floor had
shop-like windows with simnilar
chamfers to rthse od rhe left house
but window lights were narrower.

vivors including a fine grove of
tall upright Uc which are not
Boxworths.

Norman Moore's Grove. About 364-
675. On former pasture.  Trees
planted about 15 years ago and
now 20ft high. Include oak,
maple, hazel, service, hornbeam, 
birch.
   Ground vegetation predomin-
antly Anthriscus with some
nettle. Anthriscus has tsken over
the former grassland. Dr
Moore has introduced prim-
roses, bluebells, mercury, etc.
but anthriuncus is cut aeay
from them.
   Oxlip grows well in his gar-
[25050-25051]

dewn. It hybridizes with prim-
rose. The plants are quite long-
lived but the oxlip eventually
dies out. Clay with some gravel -
many mussel-shells and some
pottery found.  He has put in
aquatic plants: very few find
their way in naturally. The
water is rather acid.

   East of Swavesey is an area
of Enclosure-Act fields with very
many hawthorn hedges surviving.

LongStanton All Saints. Quite a
big and ambitious church with
a large transept (its roof prob.
cut down). Stone spire (upper

      Wicken Fen
(Corpus Christi Squares)
About half of the main fen is
now clear of bushes.  the edges of
most of the droves have been
grubbed out, revealing ridge-&-
furrow of peat-diggings (which
do not extend on to the droves them-
selves).
   Nothing in flower asave Caltha
and willows & Myrica.
   Wicken Poor's and St Edmund's
Fens are almost entirely bushed over.
The greatest area of bushes is
sallow, followed by blackthorn.
Birches are thinly scattered but tall,
oak rare.

  Most of the sallow is npow de-

is not replaced by anything.
   Crops of sedge waiting to be

   Myrica has changed little.
All that was seen is male and
has just flowered copiously.
