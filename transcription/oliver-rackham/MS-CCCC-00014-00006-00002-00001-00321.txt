Left house was evidently built
as a Wealden. Hsll had one

bay for an original chimney,
Ground-floor of parlour end was
evidently  a shop.  Door & screens
passage were probably in the
buttery cross-wing, behind the

chimney but no evidence
of them survives. This was altered,
early in the house's history, by inser-
ting a floor in the hall and csrrying 
the jetty to connect both ends. The
work was done in the style of the
original but without the pilaster
strips.
   The right-hand house, originally
of 3 storeys, probsbly once exten-
ded eastwards over the site of
the left-hand house. it is prob. noy

Norman Moore's Grove. About 364-
675. On former pasture.  Trees
planted about 15 years ago and
now 20ft high. Include oak,
maple, hazel, service, hornbeam, 
birch.
   Ground vegetation predomin-
antly Anthriscus with some
nettle. Anthriscus has tsken over
the former grassland. Dr
Moore has introduced prim-
roses, bluebells, mercury, etc.
but anthriuncus is cut aeay
from them.
   Oxlip grows well in his gar-

rose. The plants are quite long-
lived but the oxlip eventually
dies out. Clay with some gravel -
many mussel-shells and some
pottery found.  He has put in
aquatic plants: very few find
their way in naturally. The
water is rather acid.

   East of Swavesey is an area
of Enclosure-Act fields with very
many hawthorn hedges surviving.

LongStanton All Saints. Quite a

      Wicken Fen
(Corpus Christi Squares)
About half of the main fen is
now clear of bushes.  the edges of
most of the droves have been
grubbed out, revealing ridge-&-
furrow of peat-diggings (which
do not extend on to the droves them-
selves).
   Nothing in flower asave Caltha
and willows & Myrica.
   Wicken Poor's and St Edmund's
Fens are almost entirely bushed over.
