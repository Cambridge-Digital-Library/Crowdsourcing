The plant
used to
grow in
the fence
and verge
along the
lane.
In recent years the plot has been
somewhat neglected and the plant,
which is Mizomatous, has exten-
ded backward from the fence to
a depth of 30-40 ft. At the
same time, the Australian occupier
of house C has made a purpres-
ture along the lane-side verge
in front of the Cowper plot, C', as
well as in front of C itself, and
has diligently eradicated the Aristo-
lochia and replaced it with Euca-
lyptus and other incongruities.
