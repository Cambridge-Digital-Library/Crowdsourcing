THORLEY WOOD.
Thorley:numerous good mixed
hedges, occ. with hornbeam.
Jonner's Wood, Much Hadham.
Mainly hornbeam.
MATHAM'S WOOOD - card only.
DANEWOOD HOLLOWAY - card

The R. Ash in Much Hadham
is a chalk stream in relatively good
condition. Pleasant ford. Quite
good streamside and aquatic flora.
SAWTREES WOOD, THUNDRIDGE.
Below Sawtrees Wood is a ford
of the R. Rib: pleasant fast-
-thriving chalk stream. The
ford in Sandin is about 2ft
deep with soft bottom, definitely
unsuitable for vehicles.

11 June.
Aristolocia Clematitis at Whit-
tlesford.
Grows in the garden of the
house of Julia Cowper, 471480.
A: Cowper house. B: barn.
Stippled area: site of Aristolochia.

[DIAG]
The plant
used to
grow in
the fence
and verge
along the
lane.
In recent years the plot has been
somewhat neglected and the plant,
which is Mizomatous, has exten-
ded backward from the fence to
a depth of 30-40 ft. At the
same time, the Australian occupier
of house C has made a purpres-
ture along the lane-side verge
in front of the Cowper plot, C', as
well as in front of C itself, and
has diligently eradicated the Aristo-
lochia and replaced it with Euca-
lyptus and other incongruities.

[17708-17709]
7708

Several hundred flowering stems
remain. The Cowpers protect it,
but are building another house, D,
whose access has destroyed part
of the stand.
Flowers have a slight m[????]y
scent. No obvious trapped insects 
could be found.

Geranium lucidum seen at its
Hildersham site.
