Chiderley cont.
  The extinct village in the 
Great Park is a series of
earth-works in permanent pasture.
Surrounded by great elms of
the procera type, including the
row along a possible hollow
way.
In the N. part of Grove
Park, around the pond and ditch
of 354617, are faint indications 
of habitation - shallow earthworks
and patches of nettles.  The
area has been ploughed and
resown not long ago.

Hayley Wood.
The large Carex in the coppice
plots is flowering this year and
turns out to be C. acutiformis.
[10470-10471]

Polyporus sulfureus.  A fine
sporophore on a fallen oak. [DIAG]
  The wood is very dry
after a short drought.  No
standing water in the coppice
plots. Some signs of drought
in maple.  There is still one
wet path at the bottom of
Hayley Ditch.
  Of the large crab trees in
the coppice plots, the one with
three stems carefully preserved
in 1967 has died.
  Conopodium is flowering along
Hayley Ditch Ride.
  Crowns of ash are still very
thin, especially standards and
promoted trees in rhe coppice plots.
  Ash has been somewhat eaten
471
in this year's coppice plot on
stools unprotectwd by thorns, 
but those which were protected
have got off to a good start.
 Cirsium palustre is coming
up on the 1967 plot.

  The Onopordon has reached
51/2 ft high - probably not quite
the maximum.
  The surviving Eccremocarpus
has made much growth and is 
flowering.

Botanick Gradens.
Argave sp. One at rhe side of the 
plant-houses is flowering, 
very
rarely.  An enormous asparagus-like
young infl. about 7 ft high.
475
Beschhornena yuccoides.
  A remarkable monocot.
with a basal rosette of lanceo-
late leaves which is flowering
this year as it does very 
rarely.  Infl. about 7 ft
high, a stout vermillion stem
with alternate branches
bearing clusters of pendant 
yellow and green flowers
about 3/4 in long.  It looks
wilted.
Helicodiceros muscivorus (  ) Engl.
(Corsica, Balearics).  An aroid
with a remarkable pedate
leaf having 3 large lobes
and two small ones attached
to the outer pair.
Phormium tenax. Flowering.

Sempervivums.
See photographs.
1. S. tiroliensis x styriacum.
A massive stem about 8 in.
high with many leaves rather
like those of the rosette.  Flow-
ers avbout 12, each with about
14 sepals and petsls, much
larger than S. arachmoideum.
There is only one rosette,
which has flowered after many
years' vegetative growth.
  Related to either S. Wulfenii
or S. Pittonii.
2. Egnesengrat.  One infl. with
5 flowers, each about 7-merous.
Apparently an ordinary S. montan-
um.
  The Onopordon grown in
477
a tub is now nearly in
flower.  51/2 ft high, will prob-
ably grow a few inches more.
[DIAG]
  The gourds are still a
long way from flowering.

Cambridge - Harwich.
Holly is abundant near
little Bentley, between Colchester
and Harwich.

Cold Hall, Great Bromley:
Solanum dulcamara (in ditch)
[10478-10479]

pinifolia) with very elegsnt
pendulous twigs from the edge
of the crown and from the
bole.
Cornflowers are abundant
in a rye field near Leuven.
June 16.
Ostend - Ingolstadt.
Flanders appears to have
been formed by rhe rising of 
the land.  No obvious sea
walla except within a few milea
of rhew coast.  The E. edge
479
slopes gradually into the hills.
  Most of Flanders as seen is
grazing marshes wirh some
low hills.  Small woods of
Populus canadensis.
  There is a mixed wood
(perhaps planted) containing
Vicea on one od rhe hills 
near Ghent.
  The N. of Liege province is
a hill country with Bocage,
woods, and sibljak on the 
warmer slopes.
  Around Aachen are areas 
of elm woodland.
  Between Aachen and Koln
are woods of beech with oak,
& birch, probably on sands.
  Lilium Mantaga was
seen on the motorway cutting
