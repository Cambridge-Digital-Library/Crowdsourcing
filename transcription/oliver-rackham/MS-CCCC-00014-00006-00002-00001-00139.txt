Chiderley cont.
  The extinct village in the 
Great Park is a series of
earth-works in permanent pasture.
Surrounded by great elms of
the procera type, including the
row along a possible hollow
way.
In the N. part of Grove
Park, around the pond and ditch
of 354617, are faint indications 
of habitation - shallow earthworks
and patches of nettles.  The
area has been ploughed and
resown not long ago.

Hayley Wood.
The large Carex in the coppice
plots is flowering this year and
turns out to be C. acutiformis.
[10470-10471]
4760
Polyporus sulfureus.  A fine
sporophore on a fallen oak. [DIAG]
  The wood is very dry
after a short drought.  No
standing water in the coppice
plots. Some signs of drought
in maple.  There is still one
wet path at the bottom of
Hayley Ditch.
  Of the large crab trees in
the coppice plots, the one with
three stems carefully preserved
in 1967 has died
  Conopodium is flowering along
Hayley Ditch Ride.
  Crowns of ash are still very
thin, especially standards and
promoted trees in rhe coppice plots.
  Ash has been somewhat eaten
471
in this year's coppice plot on
stools unprotected by thorns, 
but those which were protected
have got off to a good start.
 Cirsium palustre is coming
up on the 1967 plot.

  The Onopordon has reached
51/2 ft high - probably not quite
the maximum.
  The surviving Eccremocarpus
has made much growth and is 
flowering.

June 13.
Botanick Gardens.
Argave sp. One at rhe side of the 
plant-houses is flowering, very 
rarely.  An enormous asparagus-like
young infl. about 7 ft high.
475
Beschhornena yuccoides.
  A remarkable monocot.
with a basal rosette of lanceo-
late leaves which is flowering
this year as it does very 
rarely.  Infl. about 7 ft
high, a stout vermillion stem
with alternate branches
bearing clusters of pendant 
yellow and green flowers
about 3/4 in long.  It looks
wilted.
Helicodiceros muscivorus (  ) Engl.
(Corsica, Balearics).  An aroid

Sempervivums.
See photographs.
1. S. tiroliensis x styriacum.
A massive stem about 8 in.
high with many leaves rather
like those of the rosette.  Flow-
ers avbout 12, each with about
14 sepals and petals, much
larger than S. arachmoideum.
There is only one rosette,
which has flowered after many
years' vegetative growth.
  Related to either S. Wulfenii
or S. Pittonii.
2. Egnesengrat.  One infl. with
5 flowers, each about 7-merous.
Apparently an ordinary S. montan-
um.
  The Onopordon grown in
477
a tub is now nearly in
flower.  51/2 ft high, will prob-
ably grow a few inches more.
[DIAG]
  The gourds are still a
long way from flowering.

Holly is abundant near
little Bentley, between Colchester

in a rye field near Leuven.

Ostend - Ingolstadt.
Flanders appears to have
been formed by rhe rising of 
the land.  No obvious sea
walla except within a few milea
of the coast.  The E. edge
479
slopes gradually into the hills.
  Most of Flanders as seen is
grazing marshes wirh some
low hills.  Small woods of
Populus canadensis.
  There is a mixed wood
(perhaps planted) containing
Vicea on one of he hills 
near Ghent.
  The N. of Liege province is
a hill country with Bocage,
woods, and sibljak on the 
warmer slopes.
  Around Aachen are areas 
of elm woodland.
  Between Aachen and Koln
are woods of beech with oak,
& birch, probably on sands.
  Lilium Mantaga was
seen on the motorway cutting

[10480-10481]

near Siegburg.
  On the shales S. of Sieg-
burg is very mixed woodland
including oak, pine, spruce, beech.
A small castanea coppice was
seen.
  Cultivated lupins are
naturalized about [????].
  Above Coblenz are small
areas of Corylus & Carpinus 
coppice much neglected and
mixed with other trees, possibly
remnants of old simple coppice.

town with many box frame
buildings usually 21/2-storeyed
without overhangs.
  Montabaur is an ancient
town with a castle on a
481

& Wiesbaden are very extensive.
Almost pure beech, uneven-aged
or even-aged in regeneration
patches.  Very close and
with few other species.  No
understorey save young beech.
Little ground vegetation.
  The woods on the Main
levels between Wiesbaden and
Hanau are a mosaic of
Scots pine and oak.  Much
of the pine appears to be
482
of wartime.  The oaks
do badly and are mainly
stag-headed, even though prob-
ably quite young.
  Spe Bart is a district of
rolling hills of a soft red sand-
stone.  Unexpectedly it has
many dry valleys both large
and small.  Forests are a mosaic

  Sun-scald is severe on 
the trunks of beeches on the
side of the new motorway near
Esselbach.
  There is much Sibljak and
scrub on rocky motorway cuttings
and abandoned farmland on
deep S. facing slopes in Spefs-
483
cut.
  In the Esselbach area areanumerous field systems with
contour strips, many now dis-
used, a few terraced.
  There are surface ex-
posures of limestone (apparently
quite thin) on the hills SW. of
Wurtzburg.
  Limestone exposures in the
Wurzburg bend of the Main are
more massive and have thermo-
philous vegetation on warm
scarps incl. Luctuca semola and
Conmilla varia.  Vines are
grown in a few places on
S. and SW. exposed hillsides,
grown on pists in vertical
rows.

(whether in valley or 
elsewhere) are closely grown,
small with short horizontal
branches.  Nearly always
dead in the crown.
