July 11.
Trumpington  Road.
DED severe. About 30% of Ug
and 30% of Up affected, mostly
this year.  Little in Uc.
Hauxton 15% plus much
recent minor infection in Up.
Baldock 80% last year -
much recent infection.
Hitchin, Letchworth, Dunstable,
Aston Clinton - few elms left
alive, the survivors (mainly
Ug) succumbing.
Ellesboro, Gt Kimble: 80% dead,
nearly all the rest (Ug & Up)
affected.
Royston 30% dead or severe last
year, 30% new infection.  A
few attacked last year now static.
[18522-18523]
8522
Beech.
  About 1/3 of the beeches in
the roadside belt below Ther-
field Heath are in very poor
condition, some almost dead.
They occur in groups. Other
belts in the area less severely
affected.
Hitchin: moderately severe in
places.
Offley: on steep SE-facing
slope most trees chlorotic, a few
dead.
Luton & Dunstable: most 
street beeches thin in the crowns
and currently droughted.
Acton Clinton: beeches pale,
some chlorotic, but not unusu-
ally severe. Some limes chlorotic.
8523
  Hawthorn is chlorotic & 
rather withered in hedges
between Dunstsble & Pitstone.

Foxgloves - prob. garden escape -
in apparently chalk rubble in
cutting at Tring.

Buildings at Wendover.
  Some 15 frames are visible.
All oak save one late & flimsy
cottage prob. 18th cent., in which
some added timbers are pine.
[18524-18525]
8524
Beech cont.
Backham Hill beyond Wendover.
Mainly well-developed hawthorn
scrub with scattered beech mainly
at edges.  Beeches very chlorotic,
a few dead.
Ellesboro. Beeches mostly thin 
in crown. About 1/4 severely
chlorotic, a few dead. No parti-
cular distinction between wood-
land & non-woodland trees. Many
sycamores chlorotic.
Longdown bottom. Many beeches have
died in the 'drought glade' tho'
none suddenly this year. Sur-
rounding beeches all bright ylw.
Abundant elder scrub, nettles,
Clematis. A few middleaged
whitebeams, one ash.
Cornus & Chamaenerion are
8525
chlorotic.
Phytophthora spots are very
frequent on the bottom 4 ft of the
trunks of chlorotic beeches.
Yew under the Longbottom
beeches is unaffectrd. Holly is
weak, one tree half dead.
Sorbus area seemingly unaffected,
flowering well.
  More beech died last year than
this - those that died last year
have deflexed, possibly epinastic,
twigs like small
elms - no, too thick to be epi-
nastic.
2nd small valley has similar
chlorotic & dead beeches, nettle &
clematis in bottom; some
Rhamnus.
Cherry - very chlorotic
[18526-18527]
8526
Ash - thin in canppy and
rather chlorotic.
Elder - very good, heavy 
with flowers.
Beech seedlings - small num-
bers in leaf - litter hollows
beneath 2 individual trees.

Pulpit Hill itself.
Beeches variable in colour,
mostly golden yellow. A few
brown or leafless.
8527
Grassland below Pulpit Hill
  Rabbits much increased -
strong browse-line on all
free-standing bushes including juni-
per.
  Abandoned arable is little
changed - sparse, probably
retreating bushes, much bare
ground.  One juniper seen.
Cornus dying back.
Linum catharticum very good.

Oldest elm 214 years old
= Bill Clarke.

Elm near site of scout-hut
(S. of Ring). Felled because
of DED. Ulmus pxc.
Trunk nearly straight. Bran-
ches [DIAG]    Suckering.
Bark fluted - retic. No epicors
Twigs irreg., thickish. Lvs
twisted, very gslled.
Youngish tree, strong wetwood.

Beeches. Felling nearly sll
done. With few exceptions
those expected to die by
Bill Clarke did so.
Canopies this year are
8541
mostly normal or slightly
chlorotic.
Common form of damage
is browsing of leaf margin,
extending progressively inwards
& in some cases involving half the
leaf.  Almost universal on
S.E. edge and occasional on
internal edges. Attributed by
W.C. to drying winds at time 
of leaf expansion.
Dead trees have the
outermost skin of bark peeling
off, leaving the inner bark
which is somewhat cracked into
a pattern.  Islets of intact 
bark remain.
  Phytoph-like exudations
very common in some areas,
notably the N.W. and the S.E.
[18542-18543]
8542
margin. Variable in size, up
to c. 3" dia.; dark crimson-
black blebs which occa-
sionally drip into ivy below.
Commonest near ground level
but occasionally as much as
12 ft high. Variable number 
per tree. Bill Clarke says this
is commonest on the S. side
and suggests relation with
cracks from overheating.
Some correlation with sickly
trees but some large blebs
are on healthy ones.
Lower branches generally
bad and in many cases
sawn away - £2000 worth
of work done by a tree-
surgeon not including clearing
up. Bark frequently comes away
8543
on underside of low branches.
  Wetwood rare but vigorous
in one or two trees.
  Beech seedlings few,
chiefly in tractor ruts or the
like. Now rapidly diminishing
in numbers.
One beech tree appeared
to be dead save one branch
and was beheaded at c.
15 ft high.  The stubs have
callused quite freely (like
the scars of amputating lower
branches) but the tree re-
mains leafless.
  Effects are patchy and
not obviously related to soil.
Trees in nearby belts % clumps
(particularly to the S.E.) are
much worse than in Wandlebury
[18544-18545]
8544
itself.
All the beeches on a gravel
patch in the extreme N. have 
died.
No fruiting this year.
Birch. Mostly dead - one big
silver birch near the scout-hut
is not unhealthy.

Elm. Great elms in the paddox
are little affected - this includes
one which is flanked by dead
polesized suckers, with no further
symptoms this year. Another is
slightly infected at top, prob.
last year. These are Up.
[SYMBOL].

A badly-affected area of beeches
is the belt along the E. boundary
8545
of the estate, where many beeches
have died.
This E. boundary has con-
siderable remains of a park
pale of a well-made mortice
post-and-rail fence wth pales
nailed to it. All oak. Possibly
the original 19th-cent. pale?

The beeches in Wandlebury 
seem not to be even-aged, but
there are few if any < 70 years
old. Recent deaths, contrary 
to statements in the papers, have
had little effect on the general
appearance of the place.
The Wort's Causeway beech-
wood has been almost unaffec-
ted by recent deaths.

Elm Disease.
  A big p-type elm in a big
garden on the E. side of Hills Road
about halfway from the railway 
to New Addenbrooke's. Has had
new houses built round it. About
1 1/2 years ago all the branches
were truncated, which has been
8547
followed by vigorous production
of pollard shoots. These are
now infected in some 15 places.
  The disease is probably
worse on ths S.E. area than
else
where in Cambridge, but 
there is no elm tree near to 
this one.

21 July.
Elm disease.
A big g-type elm of s pe-
culiar weeping cultivar: not the
Camperdown Elm, but one with
many broad-spreading horizontal
branches and weeping lower
branches. In the midst of the
great lawn, at the back of
Emmanuel College.
The tree was healthy until
[18548-18549]
8548
this month. Within the last
two days of hot dry weather it
has succumbed with remarkable 
speed. 3 of the 6 main bran-
ches are independently affec-
ted. They are wilted as if
the water-supply was suddenly
cut off. The infection has
evidently reached the main
trunk. This tree is shortly to
be felled.

Elm Disease.
  This year there has been an 
immense number of small in-
fctions, mostly several to a tree
which have appeared in most of
the elms left alive in Mid
Wilts.
Similar infections have ap-
8567
peared in elm hedges, sometimes
no more than 4 ft high, throughout
Mid Wilts but chiefly in the
Market Lavington area.  In some
hedges 1/3 of the stubs have
withered. Less common on suckers.
  All the local elms are
procera-type, probably several
clones, with few exceptions.  Ug
is rare and has been severely
attacked. Weeping Ug -? Camper
down - as in Chitterne may
be resistant.
  Woodland elms (Ug) in Oak-
frith Wood, Urchfont, are rarely
attacked.
  There is much old grassland
on the N. facing scarp by the
Westbury White Horse. Slopes of

with rock outcrops in their
sides.  Up to c. 40 ft deep. In

glauconitic colours. Wooded

Parham Wood and other woods
in Easterton near Urchfont.
Mainly oak, birch, ash stds
(mosaic). Marginal patches of
elm, mainly dead or dying.

development, partly grass-
land with junipers.  The junipers
are of various ages and genotypes.
They include several quite young
plants, some of which are in rows
beside the road as if planted - but
really marking the limits of digging-
-back the edges of the road when 
it was made up. A remarkable 
pair of bushes is of contrasting
habit, with s columnar bush growing
out of the midst of a horizontal
one; they appear to be one plant
but are of different sexes.
  Much of this rough land is
rutted by former courses of the 
track.  Dactylis dominant in grass.
Stockton Earthworks are rough
and tussocky grass, grazed by 
cattle.
