October 6:
  The Huntingdon elms on
Parker's Piece are markedly thin
in the foliage.  Leaves grayish
as if through silver-leaf. The
one on the W. corner of
Petersfield, right against the
roundabout, is partly leafless.
No evidence of DED.
  Quy Water is quite dry.
  Newmarket: no obvious DED,*
some severe drought symptoms.

replanted with conifers of 30-40
years' growth, save for some huge
(c. 5 ft) hybrid-lime stools which
have coppiced vigorously, and
for a belt of suckering elm
at its N. end alongside agricul-
tural land.
  The old plantation is full of
Armillaria, which is fruiting prodi-
giously in the lime stools (which
are somewhat overtopped by
6621
neighbouring trees). There has beren 
some spread into the new plan-
tation.  There are also foci in
pine stumps now rotted away
above ground but still existing
underground.
  Armillaria rhizomorphs and
occasional toadstools are to be
found on oaks within c. 10 yds
of infected trees, whose deaths
are probably hastened thereby.

complete; widens into a green at
Cobb's Hall.
  Great Saxham church: see Red

  Great Saxham park seems to
be mainly 18th cent.  Few ancient
elms and other trees.  Banks
suggesting former field boundaries
(e.g. that marked on 2 1/2" map
opposite "The Park" wood.
  The valley below the church,

with flat bottom and steep sides,
full of nettles.

  The Cam is more frozen now
than at any time since 1963.
Unusually slight flow for the time
of year.  Both mill-ponds and 
Queens' backwater are solidly
frozen - a merry Breugelian
scene with many skaters a d
others.  The main river is frozen 
about 1 in. thick except under
the bridges.
 Ducks are concentrated in an
open patch under Garret Hostel

Bridge, and in a lead made by
a punt breaking the ice (only
just possible when ice 1" thick).
  Very little snow left - most
of it has evaporated.  Ice smooth
and in excellent condition.

  Parietaria is abundant on the
W. front of Ely Cathedral.
