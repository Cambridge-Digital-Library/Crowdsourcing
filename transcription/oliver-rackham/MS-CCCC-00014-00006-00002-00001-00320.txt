Walnut in the garden, prob. no great
age, is dying back severely from the
top. Appears to compete severely with
a huge and very vigorous hybrid
lime.

Uppington Yew. In churchyard
S. of E. end of chancel. Said to be the
survivor of a pair. Trunk is said
to be 27 ft girth (rather irregular)
- a nearly-complete shell with a
central hollow some 6 ft dia, - used
for storing plastic jerry-cans and
churchyard junk. Tree is moder-
ately spreading, some 30 ft high.
Some old dieback. It has evidently
once had other branches, but lhe pre-
sent ones form a nearly complete 
canopy. Trunk is "messy" with
[4942-4943]
4942
epicormics.
  The church is much restored
but has several Norman features
and no sign of anything earlier. It
stands on  a slight hillock.
[!!!!] In the churchyard
is a Roman "altar" said to have
been found near tbe yew. It is of
sandatone, properly a libation-table,
some 3 ft high x 1 ft x 1 ft.

Timber-House near Uppington church
"Black-&-white", with Jacobean
features. Has "mini-jetties" in
which the two horizontal timbers
appear to be one (also seen elsewhere 
in Shropshire).

Wrekin. NMost of the woods are
coniferized - except for Limekiln
4943
Wood and poerhaps others at the E.
foot.

Stirchley. Stirchley Grange is a
complex, osyensibly 17th- or 18th-cent.
brick house, said to be on the site of
a grange odf Buildwas Abbey. The
house contains a fine floor with
moulded joists in the medieval
manner, the common-joists set on
edge. There are other apparently
medieval timbers with simple
camfers. These may not be in
situ: they form no recognizable
structure, and they all (including
the floor) lack stop-chamfers and
were probably made for a slightly
bigger building.
