14 Fewb. 1985.
Walnut in the garden, prob. no great
age, is dying back severely from the
top. Appears to compete severely with
a huge and very vigorous hybrid
lime.

Uppington Yew. In churchyard
S. of E. end of chancel. Said to be the
survivor of a pair. Trunk is said
to be 27 ft girth (rather irregular)
- a nearly-complete shell with a
central hollow some 6 ft dia, - used
for storing plastic jerry-cans and
churchyard junk. Tree is moder-
ately spreading, some 30 ft high.
Some old dieback. It has evidently
once had other branches, but lhe pre-
sent ones form a nearly complete 
canopy. Trunk is "messy" with
[4942-4943]
4942
epicormics.
  The church is much restored
but has several Norman features
and no sign of anything earlier. It
stands on  a slight hillock.
[!!!!] In the churchyard
is a Roman "altar" said to have
been found near tbe yew. It is of
sandatone, properly a libation-table,
some 3 ft high x 1 ft x 1 ft.

Timber-House near Uppington church
"Black-&-white", with Jacobean
features. Has "mini-jetties" in
which the two horizontal timbers
appear to be one (also seen elsewhere 
in Shropshire).

Wrekin. NMost of the woods are
coniferized - except for Limekiln
4943
Wood and poerhaps others at the E.
foot.

Stirchley. Stirchley Grange is a
complex, osyensibly 17th- or 18th-cent.
brick house, said to be on the site of
a grange odf Buildwas Abbey. The
house contains a fine floor with
moulded joists in the medieval
manner, the common-joists set on
edge. There are other apparently
medieval timbers with simple
camfers. These may not be in
situ: they form no recognizable
structure, and they all (including
the floor) lack stop-chamfers and
were probably made for a slightly
bigger building.

Greenwood Trust. At present works
[4944-4945]
4944
in an asbestos shed at Stirch-
ley Grange. Several new shaving-
horses & other equipment have
been made.
  They are at present making
Shropshire chairs of ash, with
turned members. Plank seats of thin
elm planks set in grooves. The legs,
Stringers, etc. are joined end-to-end
by push-fits in holes so arranged
that as the timber (originally green)
shrinks, the hole and the round
member in it shrink into ellipses
at right angles and so grip each
other.

Madeley Valley. Like the Coalbrook-
dale valley. Steep sides have
woods (apparently recent, most of
them not coppiced) of e;m & syc-
4945
more.

LLOYDS COPPICE

River Severn. Quite fast, but
bringing down many thin floes
of ice. It has recently risen
some 10 ft above its present level.

Broseley Bridge. Another iron bridge
a little later than that of Coalbrook-
dale. A rather shaliow cast-iron
and carries the roadway (which
rises only slightly) on a series 
of raking iron posts.

PREEN WOOD
HOLBROOK COPPICE
WOODS on WENLOCK EDGE.
[4946-4947]

Yews. About 6 on (or very near) the
boundary between Much Wenlock &
Barrow in the neighbourhood of New-
house Farm. Big spreadingtrees c.
3 ft thick in roadside & other lhedges
and near the groves above Downs.
  Yews are frequent field trees
elsewhere on the Wenlock Edge plateau,
esp. around Easthope. Various sizes,
inc. some very big ones - not many
young. Irregularly placed, mainly
within grass-fields. No attempt
to keep cattle from them.

Easthope Yews. Two, about 30 ft
apart, N of the church; arge church-
yard. One has a trunk about the 
size of the Uppington Yew, rather
"mossy"; big hollow used for storing
churchyard junk; complete canopy,
4947
slight old diebsack. Rather more
erect habit than Uppingtn Yew.
  The second yew is also rather 
erect, not "mossy", smaller crown,
trunk rather smaller in diameter
and a thinner, less complete shell.
The yews are not so well cared
for as at Uppington; used for stony
junk: a hut built under the
bigger one; "mossy" epicormics
trimmed away.
  Church is Norman, with internal
gantry-tower; completely burnt c.
1923 and since restored.

Wenlock Edge. Wide view to
N.MW. over a completely-hedged
landscape.
  Several very active quarries
on the ridge.
[4948-4949]
4848
Lime. Several very large field-
trees on the Wenlock Edge plateau
near Presthope - they look like T.
cordata.

Brilliant cold day. Abput 5" of
snow. Manuy drifts along minor roads
- up to some 6 ft thick. road
above Broseley Bridge impassablw
because of a stuck car.
             Gas 227200, midnight - on
13 Feb.
  Inserting figure-nos in the text
of the book.
  Visited David Coombe - he is
feverish and depressed.
  William Horbury's party.
  Still well below freezing. My
roof still has much snow. Snow
generally continuous. Backwaters
4949
of river frozen, and thin ice on
main river despite the level 
having been let down.

in book.
  Went to the Evanses at Coton.
Still continuous snow - several
cycles of freeze-thaw have
hardened the drifts on the Coton
Footpath so that they can be
ridden over.
  Icicles on most roofs - up
to 4 ft long on Queens' Old Court.
                Gas 228330, 11 pm.

  Inserting fig-nos & corrections.

Tollgate, Bury St Edmund's. No
trace of an ancient bridge.

Fornham St Martin. Several old
lone trees (?hybrid) line the main 
road. prob. remains of an avenue.
  The great park is now farmland.
Boundary wall of flint & brick, very
dilapidated.
  Boundary grove of park is of
various trees, including much elm,
mow all felled & suckering.

S.W. of Dixon's betwewen lthe road
& the riveer, ks a fewn wood lfd alder\& sallow, with somew hazel. Biggish
stools. [????Partly] and unsuccessfully
coniferized.
4951
Elms. No large living elms seen
today. Abundant suckers, freq.
disease.

Lime stool. Hybrid lime, c. 6 ft dia.,
boundary belt of Fornham Park.
[4952-4953]

Cleaving Oak.
With Richar Darrah.
Material: butt log (12 ft) of an
oak from Rougham, in a grove,
felled because in way of farm
vehicles & dsol;;ds for Â£19. (Being
only one tree it would have been
saleable only as mining timber -
during a coal strike!)
  Radius 7 3/4" + nearly 1/2" bark; 2 1/8"
sapwood included.
58 years' growth, inc. 17 years sap-
wood.
