In E. Holland, between
Apeldoorn and the German
frontier, there are considerable
areas of acid heath and
birch scrub, as on the breck.
This is probably quite wet
in places. There is also heath
on sand near Voorth[????]zen,
near the Zuider Zee, probably
on old dunes.
Elms are rare in Olden-
burg and Brunswick. Oaks,
birches, limes, and poplars
are the commonest trees.
Populus canadensis is ex-
tensively planted but has
been much damaged by a
recent storm; in places about
a third of the mature trees
have been broken off at
the base of the crown.
Between [????]horn and
[SYMBOL]bisfelde (Brunswick) is a
large area of heaths, rough
grassland, pine forests (P. syl-
vestris) and uncultivated
land generally. It is very
like the breck, but without

[6894-6895]

the bracken. It has much Calluna.
Spruce is scattered and
infrequent in Brunswick, but
forms big forests just E. of
the E. German border.
