lot of maple in this area
up to 1ft diam. Many trees
are dead or rotten, but no
sign of Armillaria has yet
been found.
November 9.
No Armillaria sporophores
have been seen this autumn;
possibly this is due to
a dry summer and early
frosts.

In E. Holland, between
Apeldoorn and the German
frontier, there are considerable
areas of acid heath and
birch scrub, as on the breck.
This is probably quite wet
in places. There is also heath
on sand near Voorth[????]zen,
near the Zuider Zee, probably
on old dunes.
Elms are rare in Olden-
burg and Brunswick. Oaks,
birches, limes, and poplars
are the commonest trees.
Populus canadensis is ex-
tensively planted but has
been much damaged by a
recent storm; in places about
a third of the mature trees
have been broken off at
the base of the crown.
Between [????]horn and
[SYMBOL]bisfelde (Brunswick) is a
large area of heaths, rough
grassland, pine forests (P. syl-
vestris) and uncultivated
land generally. It is very
like the breck, but without

[6894-6895]

the bracken. It has much Calluna.
Spruce is scattered and
infrequent in Brunswick, but
forms big forests just E. of
the E. German border.

The Armillaria toadstools
in Grasshopper Lodge are
still there, though damaged by frost.
November 28.
A small round wasps'
nest the size of a cricket
ball, and a large spongey
one were found in the
cavity wall of the Leckhamp-
ton summer-house.
November 29.
Some more coppicing
was done in Hayley Wood.
November 30.
A small tuft of Armil-
laria was seen in a
hedge bottom in Hayley Lane.
Quite fresh. Characteristic
except for the weak ring and
absence of smell. (Nov. 29)
December 1.
There was a slight
transient fall of snow in
the night, with a continuous
layer in the early morning.
December 2.
The snow rapidly melted
and no more came.
December 3.
A hard ground and air
frost with thick ice on po[????].

December 10.
The weather is at present
rather open.
December 11.
There has been consider-
able work done in Fanshawe
House (No. 7) probably because
of dry rot. The whole floor
of the small ground floor
room on the garden front
(next to mine in 1961-2) has
been replaced. The joists
rested on sleeper walls.
The floor continued under
the three thick walls (pro-
bably brick) [!!!!]of[!!!!] on the
internal sides of the room;
the timbers bearing these
were not affected. The
source of the rot may
have been the brick
verandah floor, at about
floor level outside; the
wooden post supporting the
heavy verandah roof is how-
ever sound although quite

[6904-6905]

exposed to the weather.
It was not possible to
see any of the rotten wood.
December 12.
Rain all day.
December 13.
Coppicing was continued
in [!!!!][????]hampton[!!!!] Hayley. The day
was dry after a short
period of rain in the morning,
ending with a remarkably
heavy shower.
The following trees
were recorded (all ashes):
A. Probably not a stool tree;
no sign of previous coppicing.
50 ft high, 9 3/4 in. dia.
64 years old (1900); year
36 (1936) a particlularly good
one, thereafter poor.
B. No sign of previous coppic-
ing. 140 [SYMBOL] 5 years old (1824
[SYMBOL] 5). Rings uniform, except
in the last 20 years when
they are very thin. 16 1/2 in.
dia. Slight butt rot. 44ft high
This tree is of great
interest. It is only
slightly smaller than the
standard ashes, of which
there are a few (especi-
ally at the S.W. side of
plot No. 2). Despite its large
trunk diameter, the crown
is small and thin, with
no fast-growing twigs. The
crown is [!!!!] smaller than
that of many p[????]-ashes.
The tree is clearly weak,
but shows no definite signs

[6906-6907]

of disease (apart from
several brown odourless pupae,
probably of a moth,
found in a very rotten
branch).
C. Stool tree. c.52 ft high.
Diam. 10 3/4 in. 66 years
(1898).
Hazel catkins are already
well formed. A branch was
cut in Hayley Loke and
put in water in College.
December 14.
Wood-worms very heavily
infest the roof (being demol-
ished) of the (probably ori-
ginal) coal-house attached
to Fanshawe House no. 7.
December 15.
Dense fog all day.
December 16.
The fog continues.
A small amount of [????]-

December 24.
There was a slight
fall of snow late at night.
December 25:
A white Christmas.
Much snow fell during
the night, forming a layer
2 in. deep on the back
lawn. It was driven by
a strong N.W. wind and con-
sisted of large soggy flakes
which impacted not only on
twigs and poles but also
around the edges of houses
on the up-wind side.
More snow fell later
from the same direction.
It left off in the evening, by
when it was 6in. deep on the
front grass and on level
ground in Heartsease Lane,
and 6 1/2 in. on the back grass.
A N. facing wall was covered
up to 4 in. thick at the top.

[6910-6911]

December 26.
A fine sunny day
with no thaw.
[????] in. depth of snow
in a level open place on
Mousehold.
Several branches are
broken off conifers by the
weight of snow. A pine
tree 4 in. thick was snapped
off, apparently during the
day.
Many fruits of Rumex
obtusifolius have come off
during the night and day
and are lying about the
snow.
A remarkable effect is
the formation of long
sharp-edged ridges of snow
on the up-wind side of
branches, poles, [????] on small
[DIAG]
twigs (A) there
is a thin blade of snow
of considerably greater
bulk than the twig
itself. On objects of 1 in.
to about 1 1/2ft diam. (B)
there is a ridge which
(if well-formed) has
plane sides tangent
to the cyclinder. On
large tree-trunks (c) the

[6912-6913]

ridge is still sharp-edged
but not quite tangent
to the trunk (broken line).
The height of all ridges
is about 4 in. except
the somewhat smaller
ones on very large or
very small objects.
The ridges [DIAG]
branch ele- [DIAG]
gantly when [DIAG]
growing on [DIAG]
branched trees. [DIAG]
They are generally best
formed between 5 and
30 ft from the ground,
but there are many ex-
ceptions. Malformed
ridges (resulting probably
from fluctuations in the
wind direction or large
fluctuations in wind speed)
[DIAG]
are rounded at the
back (E) or convex-sided (F) or
both.
Artichokes 1 lb 10 1/2oz
The artichokes are few
and small this year, per-
haps as a result of
drought.
The ground is quite
unfrozen

[6914-6915]

December 27.
A fine but misty day
with no thaw.
A very hard frost
has frozen bowls of
crocuses, tulips, and hya-
cinths in the summerhouse.
The aforementioned
crocuses, planted on the
surface of compact oxi-
dized [????] peat, have
pushed themselves up
by the roots, though the
latter have eventually
penetrated.
The snow has been
considerably reduced,
partly by strong winds,
partly by ground melting.
Snow was only 4 in. deep
on front and back grass
by evening.
December 28.
A very little further snow
fell.
There is considerable
winter-sporting on St James's
Hill, with many sledgers and
[????] skiers.
Much pancake ice has
formed on the river, especially
between Bishop Bridge and the
Cow Tower, but it does
not cover the river continu-
ously.
December 29.
The morning was [!!!!] cold-front
weather with a little snow.
The depth on the back grass
is now reduced to 2 1/2 in.

[6916-6917]

In the afternoon, a warm
front set in, with heavy and
prolonged snow, sleet, and rain.
By night, much of the snow
had melted, though there was
still an almost continuous cover.
December 30.
All the snow went during
the day, except in large com-
pacted masses.
December 31.
A small amount of snow
lingers in [????] at Wroxham.
There is also a little ice on
the river and broad.
[DIAG]
January 1.
2-3 much decayed
sporophores on the stock of

Flammulina velutipes or
Naematoloma fasciculare,
probably the latter since
the stipe agreed with it.

Snow lingered yesterday as
banks and the remains of
drifts in N. facing hollows around
Wymondham.
January 3.
There has been little snow in
Cambridge.
January 4.

At the western edge of
Grantchester village, on the way
to Canteloupe, is a small
pond in a spinney by the
roadside. It has a few
immense willow (S. fragilis)
trees on the banks. Some
rather obscure holes may be
due to badgers, but there is
no sign of recent activity.
Stereum hirsutum. On dead wood
by this pond.
There is no sign of badger
activity in the wet copse

Madingley Wood.
There is a thriving badger
sett in the chalk-pit in the
pan-handle, with much
fresh excavation.
Mercury is remarkably
variable in the extent to
which last year's leaves per-
sist.
The old part of the
wood is very variable in
composition: mainly elm
near the main road,
further down the hill ash-
oak-coppice or in places
ash without hazel or
hawthorn coppice. There
is pure ash at the junc-
tion of the pan-handle.
At the N.W. corner is a
large horse-chestnut tree.
Black holes are few,
despite the existence of
old excavations
over much of the wood.
Ther are many large
[!!!!]emergent[!!!!] pioneer trees,
mainly elms, in the old
part of the wood.
The ground is fairly
dry, and cracks are
not yet completely healed.
Clitocybe ________ (large
buff-coloured). Frequent, in
large groups but hardly
in rings.
The day was again wet

ride opened by Tony Vine
which runs parallel to
the N.E. ride.
Clitocybe ________ . Scarce.
Tremella foliacea. Some
magnificent ones, up to 3in.
long, opposite the main
pond on the N.W. ride.
The area round and
E. of the pond, over

[6924-6925]

several acres, has a
strong rather rank smell
which may be due to deer.

Badgers [????] in Hayley Wood.
Signs of activity in the
banked area along the E.
margin are clear, but owing
to the activities of rabbits, foxes,
and sheep they are some-
times difficult to make out
in detail.
Tracks shown on plan
are prominent and reasonably
free from rabbit pellets.
A. Two holes in 1964 coppiced
area. Fresh excavations, possible
dung pits. Unusually small,
but rabbit droppings few &
badger hairs found.
B. Four holes recently blocked,
rather large for rabbits, but with
no badger tracks near (but [????]-

[6932-6933]

[DIAG]

[6934-6935]

ther are there in the immediate
vicinity of C).
C. Two large holes, one under
the roots of a great ash.
Fresh excavation with de-
finite foot marks, hairs, abun-
dant recent straw bedding.
D. Various other holes recently
blocked.
E. Recently blocked hole with
footmarks.
F. About 6 holes blocked and
partly reopened, with badger
hairs.
G. Large open badger-like
hole, but without hairs.
There are many other rabbit
holes in the Melampyrum
hedge, some of them blocked.
H.H. Fence crossings.
I. Rotten elm logs damaged.
Mr. Horsford does not
know of the existence of
badgers here. He has recently
ferretted various banks for
rabbits with little success,
which may explain the
blocked holes.
No sign of drinking at
the S. pond.
There are various rab-
bit holes in the wood,
particularly in the Triangle.
Nowellia
Small quantities on
many dead oaks within
