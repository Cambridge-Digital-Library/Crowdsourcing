26 August 1984
Lime Kiln. Fuel is [????]
- apparently winemaking residue.
Two kilns side by side, both
burning away with 2 men in
attendance - Sunday morning.
Short tower, probably mortaced with
non-calc[????] mortar.  A very
fierce fire glows yellow-hot through
the stokehole.  Smoke smells of
baking Christmas-cake.  Produce
is taken away in big lorries.
There are 2 pairs of kilns
near the chapel of [????] [????].
In Pliocene - there seems to be
no hard limestone near at hand.
Each kiln has an engine chug-
ging in a pit beside it. Probably
[????] will burn only in a
draught.
[4406]
Chapel of St George, Aphyss[????].
Lectern made of 5-plywood.
At 11 a.m. - [????] a hot morning this
was being audibly [????] by
worms, which make a crackling
sound like a small fire, accompanied
by tapping.  Many tunnels & flight
- holes already visible.  They are
about 3 1/2 mm dia., not much [????]
than the thickness of the wood, and
sometimes break through to the surface.
Similar sounds proceeding from a
beechwood chair.  Pine is also 
attacked.  Several colonies of 
such insects are evidently at
work in the church.
Visit with Bill Cavanagh & J[????]t
Cro[????}el to the Eurotas Gorge - 
as yesterday, but going downstream.
[4407]
MANIOPA
Hill of mainly limestone.
N.W. side is uncultivated.
Tall, little-browsed M of [????].
Occasional Judas.  Spartium
freq. near base of hill.  Only small
patches of G.  No Paliurus.
(This example shows that the
dry belt does not extend so far.)
S.E. side is neglected olive groves,
being invaded by Qc and Judas.
Paliurus freq. at roadside
around base of hill, extending
at least 1Km to S.E.
River lined by plane-trees
with patches of elm and occ.
alder.  Beside the river are
small cult. or ex-cult. plains,
many of them neglected and
their orange-trees partly dead.
[4408-4409]
Deciduous oak (brachyphylla)
scarce in lower slopes of Pali[????].
Rare in the district.
UPPER EUROTAS GORGE
River boarded by big plane-
trees, most of them not pollarded.
Beds of Arundo.  Occasional small
river terraces (2 levels) with
orange-trees, better cultivated than
on Pali[????}ra plain.
We came upon a man cutting
hay in an orange-grove who talked
of an ancient aqueduct from
Vivari to Sparta.
Cable Bridges.  We found 4, of
which nos (and 4 are in ap-
parent disuse.
Typical bridge is a cable of
[4409]
some 3/4" dia. attached to
stout (2 ft dia.) plane-trees. On
it hangs from 2 pulleys a wooden
box about 4ft x 2ft.  The rider
pulls himself across.  All the 
cables are higher one side than
the other - probably to prevent
the car from being stuck at the
bottom of the catenary.  The plat-
forms for getting on and off are
[????] pole, approached by rickety
ladders and catwalks.
No. 3 from upstream is a
more recent bridge of 2 cables
attached to plane-trees, with at
one end a kind of iron-frame in-
corporating both a ladder and a
tensioning device.  There is an iron
car with 4 pulleys.
[4410]
27 Aug.
Zones of Taygetus.
600-900 [????] dense macchia or
wood derived there from
900-1200 mountain macchia,
very sparse (dense around
[SYMBOL}
1200-1700 [????] coniferous woods
1700-1850 scattered trees
1850 â†’ "barren".
These zones are as seen from
Taygetus (rarely visible except in
early morning, and not always
then, because of haze).
Acropolis of Sparta repeating the
photograph of Taygetus which forms
the frontispiece of the Artemis Orthia
excavation report, and Edward
Lear's distant view of Mystras
[4411]
Site of "Artemis Orthia" photo-
graph.
20 yds SSE of trig-print on
W. end of Acropolis of Sparta.
The Acropolis is full of Gophodel,
which is not generally common.
Also [????]ull[????} als.
Calicotome occ.
Spartium freq.
Phlomis fruit. v. als.
Eryngium
Avena cf sterilis
Plantago lag[????]
Tri[????] stella[????]
T. [????]
Aegi[????]s [SYMBOL]
Pallenis
