       KALLIKRATIS
In the evening, in worsening wer-
ther, we drove along tnis lonely and
execrable road, through many =miles
of uninhabited mountains and ar-
rived at a large village of stone houses.
The whole village was almost deser-
ted but in reasonably good repair.
Church eith 2 naves.
   When we were turning round to 
go back, 2 mem came up who told us
where we were and invited us for
[22278-22279]
2278
a drink. (We were an unusual
party - 2 women, both voluble Greek,
taking with them 1 man.)
   Our hosts were an elderly man,
a middle-aged couple and a boy.
They said they were one of 4 families
now in the village, which had 100
families in summer. It is a summer
village where sheep & goats are pastured.
Our hosts are from [SYMBOL]
but others come from [SYMBOL] and
[SYMBOL] - all these being places on
the S. coast from which [SYMBOL]
is accessible on foot. Owing to these
movements of populations and similar
ones in [SYMBOL],a school is held in
summer at [SYMBOL] and the
school at [SYMBOL] is shut down.
   The house has a central hall
about 15 ft square and 12ft high,
2279
spanned by a huge semicircular
arch. Partitioned rooms and cur-
     [DIAG]
tained recesses lead off right
and left. One such recess contains
at least one pithos c.4 ft high.
Front door of the usual tubular
tin kind. Central table with chairs.
Large divan with rugs along the 
back wall; on it lay a rifle where
its owner had laid it down.
Flat roof of concrete on older
stone walls. Concrete floor.
   Heating by hot embers from the
[22280-22281]
2280
kitchen fire smouldering in a
cut-open 10-gallon jerrycan on
the floor: an arrangemnt quite
effective and not at all unpleasant,
\but whch is liable to set fire to
the rugs on the floor.
   Chairs of the Cretan kind with
rudely-carved backs; wood unidenti-
fied but possibly olive or pear.
 Meal of excellent stewed beans
& bread with unusually good wine, 
of the usuak W. Cretsan variety of
maderized red wine.
   The rain began at our arrival
and poured down in torrents; when
we left it was quite difficult 
to find our way out among the
confused and half-dflooded lanes of
the village.

cultivation.
Small riverine wood of ap-

a non-concave hillside.
   Ancient pollards and other
old trees are in a [????minority] and

standard trees, up to c. 9" dia.
Cultivation seems to have in-
creased in recent years.

Disease evidently much less

[SYMBOL[
The western of three headlands
4 km W. of Canea. Almost an
island joined by a narrow cause-
way. Marly Limestone, strongly
case-hardened.
The island, about 200 yards across,
[22290-22291]
2290
is flat-topped. A large doline
in the middle. The whole is honey-
combed with caves, one of which
forms a passage from the N. coast
into the doline. The N. coast is 
protected by large detached blocks
of limestone, evidently resulting
from past collapses of caves.
The top of the island is thickly
strewn with Minoan & Roman
sherds, many of which are cemen-
ted into the top surfaces of the 
detached blocks.
   The adjoining mainland has
a network of wide roads with
street-lamps (now rusting away),
the result of an abortive urban-
ization attributed to the Colonels'
period.
   The two little headlands to the
2291
E. are also important Minoan
sites.
     Phoenix Theophrasti
About 2 moles W.of the middle of
Canea, on the M. side of the main
road, is a litle Turkish villa with
about 12 big palm-tees in  the
garden. Some 6 of them are iden-
tified by Jenny as Theophrasti.
These are slightly shorter, more 
heavily built, with snorter broader

[DIAG]
The road is cut into the hillside
about 200 ft above the river -
much higher than shown on the
geological map. It crosses the
ravine shortly above a fork. About
20 yds above the road, the stream
descends a waterfall somw 20 ft
high; this may be partly due to
2293
making of the road. The face is
N.E. and the site very shady with
Arbutus and Q. ilex on the cliff.
Ordinary phyllite rock.
  Woodwardia bout 20 plants;
each wirh 4-5 fronds about
2 to 4 ft long. These appear to

beach consists of jagged beach-rock 
with pools. Litle polluted, but rock-
pool life is not very impressive.
They had shot three birds the]size of thrushes, which we had for
supper; they were fried very well-done
and it was possible to crunch up
the bones. Not very much meat.

        Fishing at Elephonissi.
[SYMNOL<] [SYMBOL] and
a friend set the nets with a motor
dinghy at about 1 hour before sunset.
We took them up starting about 7
a.m. (about sunrise) - the work
took about 1 hour.
Net is of yellow nylon, about 1 km
long and 1 m wide, held vertically
near the top of water about 10 ft deep
by means of plastic floats and lead
weights about 1 m apart on the top
& bottom ropes.
[22338-22339]
2338
The net is really 3 nr]ets: a middle
one of about 10 cm squre mesh,
each side od which is the outer net
about 2 cm squre meash. The fish
collide with the outer net & drive
pockets of it through the meshes
of the inner n et.
The site was about 693302, off
Thryombokampos, about 200 yds off-
shore. The boat was brought down on
a trailer (along the very rocky road 
thro' Enneachoria) and launched a
little E. of Elaphonisi. Water here is shallow with ledges of beachrock -
the launching would have been dangerous
in anything more than a flat calm.
   To get up the nets one man stands
in the bows, hauls the net in and
heaps it up in the boat. The net
comes in lengths of about 300 m, each
2339
of which is put in a sack & taken
ashore. We then set to work getting
the fish out - a tedious job and dis-
agreeble owing to the spinhy fins etc.
