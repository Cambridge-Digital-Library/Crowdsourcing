       KALLIKRATIS
In the evening, in worsening wer-
ther, we drove along tnis lonely and
execrable road, through many =miles
of uninhabited mountains and ar-
rived at a large village of stone houses.
The whole village was almost deser-
ted but in reasonably good repair.
Church eith 2 naves.
   When we were turning round to 
go back, 2 mem came up who told us
where we were and invited us for
[22278-22279]
2278
a drink. (We were an unusual
party - 2 women, both voluble Greek,
taking with them 1 man.)
   Our hosts were an elderly man,
a middle-aged couple and a boy.
They said they were one of 4 families
now in the village, which had 100
families in summer. It is a summer
village where sheep & goats are pastured.
Our hosts are from [SYMBOL]
but others come from [SYMBOL] and
[SYMBOL] - all these being places on
the S. coast from which [SYMBOL]
is accessible on foot. Owing to these
movements of populations and similar
ones in [SYMBOL],a school is held in
summer at [SYMBOL] and the
school at [SYMBOL] is shut down.
   The house has a central hall
about 15 ft square and 12ft high,
2279
spanned by a huge semicircular
arch. Partitioned rooms and cur-
     [DIAG]
tained recesses lead off right
and left. One such recess contains
at least one pithos c.4 ft high.
Front door of the usual tubular
tin kind. Central table with chairs.
Large divan with rugs along the 
back wall; on it lay a rifle where
its owner had laid it down.
Flat roof of concrete on older
stone walls. Concrete floor.
   Heating by hot embers from the
[22280-22281]
2280
kitchen fire smouldering in a
cut-open 10-gallon jerrycan on
the floor: an arrangemnt quite
effective and not at all unpleasant,
\but whch is liable to set fire to
the rugs on the floor.
   Chairs of the Cretan kind with
rudely-carved backs; wood unidenti-
fied but possibly olive or pear.
 Meal of excellent stewed beans
& bread with unusually good wine, 
of the usuak W. Cretsan variety of
maderized red wine.
   The rain began at our arrival
and poured down in torrents; when
we left it was quite difficult 
to find our way out among the
confused and half-dflooded lanes of
the village.

cultivation.
Small riverine wood of ap-

a non-concave hillside.
   Ancient pollards and other
old trees are in a [????minority] and

standard trees, up to c. 9" dia.
Cultivation seems to have in-
creased in recent years.

Disease evidently much less

[SYMBOL[
The western of three headlands
4 km W. of Canea. Almost an
island joined by a narrow cause-
way. Marly Limestone, strongly
case-hardened.
The island, about 200 yards across,
[22290-22291]
2290
is flat-topped. A large doline
in the middle. The whole is honey-
combed with caves, one of which
forms a passage from the N. coast
into the doline. The N. coast is 
protected by large detached blocks
of limestone, evidently resulting
from past collapses of caves.
The top of the island is thickly
strewn with Minoan & Roman
sherds, many of which are cemen-
ted into the top surfaces of the 
detached blocks.
   The adjoining mainland has
a network of wide roads with
street-lamps (now rusting away),
the result of an abortive urban-
ization attributed to the Colonels'
period.
   The two little headlands to the
2291
E. are also important Minoan
sites.
     Phoenix Theophrasti
About 2 moles W.of the middle of
Canea, on the M. side of the main
road, is a litle Turkish villa with
about 12 big palm-tees in  the
garden. Some 6 of them are iden-
tified by Jenny as Theophrasti.
These are slightly shorter, more 
heavily built, with snorter broader

[DIAG]
The road is cut into the hillside
about 200 ft above the river -
much higher than shown on the
geological map. It crosses the
ravine shortly above a fork. About
20 yds above the road, the stream
descends a waterfall somw 20 ft
high; this may be partly due to
2293
making of the road. The face is
N.E. and the site very shady with
Arbutus and Q. ilex on the cliff.
Ordinary phyllite rock.
  Woodwardia bout 20 plants;
each wirh 4-5 fronds about
2 to 4 ft long. These appear to

   Chestnuts re quite leafless, so
disease not certsinly identifiable on

are dead, if any.
Primrose. Seversl plants found by
J. Diamant in one place, under
chestnut by stream int he
Sassalo-Mylonon valley.
   Macchia and gariga do not
occur under chestnuts; instead
there is rather tenuous grsss-
land, with abundant Cyclamen
and other herbs.
   The only nuts lying about are
a few undersized ones.

    Sassalou Pharangi
   Wide gorge with varied topo-]
graohy, including mighty cliffs.
   Screes on E.-facing side, below
Sassalo, are very imposing, ex-
tending thousands of feet almost
to the crest of the ridge.
   We returned from Sassalo to
Phloria, through mainly cultivated
xountrt on steep slopes. A festure 
of this area, which is mainly p[hyl-
lite, are many fields put
down to grass.
Weather. Exceptionally cold, about
5°C all day, with strong wind. We
picknicked in an exposed place by
the Pharangi Mesarlias! Cloudy most
of the day: light rain in afternoon.
