Clunch-pit, Harlton
Grid ref. (391,520)
Can be divided into:

thin rendzina overlying
the chalk ridge.

fresher sides of the pit
(long disused)
3. Scree slopes below, in
parts compacted.
4. Scrubby grassland in
the bottom.

trees, in an older and
partly filled in part of
the pit.
37. Acrocladium cuspidatum.
[5214-5215]
very abundant generally
in the grassland and on
scree. On compact chalk
earth slopes, it develops a
peculiar coarse habit and
reddish colour.

Very abundant and
charcteristic on compact
earth in the scree region,
forming detachable mats.
39. Fissidens vindulus
Local in the scree zone.
40. Campylium chrysophyllum
Abundant and occasionally
almost pure,ibid.

woods inside pit.

abundant in the grassland.

-lvd form, rather similar
to some of the poorer Con-
tinental specimens.

abundant isolated blocks
of clunch.
Pellia fabbroniana. Local, scree,
with Leiocolea.
Bryum capillare. Abundant,
trunks and roots of trees.

been found fruiting here
on one occasion.
Hylocomium splendens. Rare,

side of the Rh. triquetrus

rosus. Straggling and
poorly developed. Apparently 
the only natural occurrence
in the county.

dant on divere trees.
Bryum erythrocarpum. Abundant
on compacted earth.
Viola odorata was found
flowering, the pit being very
sheltered.

A gray squirrel was
seen about dusk in West 
Road. It climbed up a

follow it.
