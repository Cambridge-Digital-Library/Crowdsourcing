[DIAG]
Fomes annosus.
Large gaps 
are very numer-
ous in this region,
sorophores scarce.
60. Ganoderma lucidum
(Feb. 24, Hardwick Wood).
Many were seen 
around three widely separ-
ated old stumps, apparent-
ly oak. Up to 7-6-1/2, but
very irregular.
P. variously shaped,
dull crimson, usually with
a thin fawn-brown surface
film, [SYMBOL] matt, [!!!!]tangentially
sulcate. Crust ganoder-
man, with a fibrous layer
underneath. Margin vertical,
deeply sulcate.
S. very various, usually
buried to within 1 in. of
the top surface like the
P. but usually var-
nished, solid, soft when
fresh becoming woody.
[5236-5237]
P.S. ginger-brown, with
a white pruina easily re-
moved when fresh. P. me-
dium sized (150[????]), angu-
lar, dense (5 to the mm).
Tubes pale brown, to
3/8 in. long, in at least
two separable layers.
C. mid brown, corky
The P. takes several forms:
1. Central
2. Excentric.
3. Lateral (the commonest).
The S. is oblique to the
P. (perpedicular in the 
other cases) and ap-
pears to arise from the
back bending sharply
down.
The P. in commonly
round or rhombic bu tmay
be lobed due to the pre-
sense of obstructions.
It sometimes, but not
often, incorporatess grass
or leaves. Two orig-
inally separate pilei were
found which had fused, 
the fusion being apparent
on top but not trace
of it being visible on
the P.S.
[DIAG]
[5238-5239]

[DIAG]
[5240-5241]
[DIAG]
The S. is sometimes
deeply buried in the 
ground and is ap-
parently continuous
with a long branched
sclerotium covered with
a brown shiny [!!!!]crust.
The sclerotium some-
times bears hollow
empty shells wich 
appear to be the bases
of old sporophores.
March 11.
Daphne laureda is
quite abundant among
old hawthorn scrub
in the bottom of the
old chalk-pit on Bar-
ring-ton hill.
[5242-5243]
Apparently primary
chalk grassland occurs
around the margin of
this pit.
March 12.
A very little snow 
fell in the afternoon.
March 13.
No snow today.
March 14.
There was a very 
thin transient layer of

[TABLE]
The Mahonia has
lost most of its lvs by
frost.
March 18.
The two ash trees out-
side Thorpe branch library
that were parasitized
by Ganoderma have
been cut down together
with the oak tree that
was there.
There is still snow
lying in sheltered places
at Norwich, and the
[5244-5245]
ground is partly frozen.
A little snow fell.
The roses have
not been much dam-
maged by frost.
Oak rafters removed
from the triforium roofs
at the E. end of the
Cathedral are much
attacked especially
at the ends by beetle
and dry rot. The lat-
ter has showed no
tendency to spread
and appears to be
dormant.
The Eranthis has
produced two lvs
but no fls.
Birds have at-
tacked the early crocuses.
Starlings come in
great numbers to feed
on bread soaked in
fat and put on the
back grass. They vary 
somewhat in size and
colour. They find dif-
ficulty in disposing of
the crust, but eventually
break it up and
fly off with it. No other
s[????]p take part, except 
the occasional sparrow.
March 19.
Camptothecium intes-
cens and Xanthoria pari-
etina grown abundantly
on tiles now being
removed from the chapel
[5246-5247]
roof, St Catharine's
March 20.
Dry rot has been
found in the attic
at the top of [????] stair-
case in the New
Court on the court 
side. It is situated
at the bottom of the
dead space between
the attic florr and
the ceiling below. It
has taken the end
off one of the 19th
cent. principal timbers
which span the
building and carry
the weight of the who;e
attic structure. It
has also attacked
the ends of the ceiling
joists. It probably orig-
inated in a leaky gutter.
March 21
A small quantity of
rotten timber has been
removed from the
bathroom of the set
DI, being converted 
from the Dean of Chapel's
set to a senior com-
mon room.
March 22.
Owls have been
heard about midnight.
March 23.
The dead branch
of the poplar in Leck-
hampton grounds which 
used to bear Pleuntus,
[5248-5249]
has been cut off. The
wood is still nearly as
hard as in unrotted
poplar. Woodpeckers
have made large holes
in the branch.
March 24.
A wren was seen
among creepers on
John's New Court.
March 25.
A water rat was seen
by the narrow dyke
separating the cause-
way leading to John's
S.W. gate from Trinity
Piece. Earless, with a
tail about half as long
as the body. It rapidly
plopped into the dyke
and disappeared into an
underwater hole in the
piling on the other side.
March 26.
Owls are very loud
and persistent in Leck-
hampton late at night.
March 27.
A tit was seen attack-
ing a milk bottle top at
Fanshawe. It made a
large hole.
March 28.
Daffodils are just starting
flowering.
March 29.
Plums are just starting
flowering.
March 30.
A bat was seen in
[5250-5251]
Queen's at 8 p.m. (summer
time).
March 31.
There was a heavy
thunderstorm with heavy
rain and soft hail, ten-
ding to snow. A transient
cover was formed.
April 1.
There was a heavy
shower of snow and rain
at Hinxton.  Bryophyte 62
At Whittlesford is a 
large beech with a very 
large lightning scar of long
standing running obliquely
down in the lower 20 ft.
The trunk twists appre-
ciably in a high wind.
Viola odorata is
flowering at Whittlesford.
It occurs abundantly by
the shelford road and
sparingly in the park
next the church.
April 2.
A very strong wind.
April 3.
A sharp thunderstorm
with heavy rain and hail.
A bat was seen in
Queen's Cloister Court about
8 p.m. summer time.

sheltered sitiations.
April 5.
Birds are very noisy
about 6 a.m. S.T.
[5252-5253]
April 6
Elders are very varia-
ble in time of production
of lvs.
April 7. NEWNHAM HOUSE
A dead hedgehog pro-
bably killed by a car)
was found in Selwyn
Gardens.
At Little Shelford, on
the E. side of the Whittles-
ford road just out of
the village is a fresh
beech stump about 4ft
diam. At one side is
a large Ganoderma.
The tree was probably
dead; it is all more or
lesss decayed except for 
a narrow strip along
one side. The most rotten
part is pale yellow of
mushy consistency.
There are many zone
lines. The majority are
very thick and double,
ranging from almost
touching to 2mm apart.
Between two lines is a
strip of relatively less de-
cayed wood. The zone
lines thus enclose re-
gions of wood on all
sides. Adjacent regions
differ in stage of decay.
The regions are usu-
ally [SYMBOL] radial, but with
very irregular outlines
and occasional enclaves.
The zone lines ex-
[5254-5255]
tended uninterrupted into
the bark and reach
for the surface. The
zones thus appear to
represent several inde-
pendent infections ad-
vancing in succession,
rather than one infection
advancing by jumps.
There are a few
narrow single zone lines;
these do not define
regions of more or
less rotting, and cut 
across the main system.
No A[????]cina was
found, but the bark
was mostly very rot-
ten.
Bryophytes in Rayner's Grove (grid
467,488) and Park Wood
(469,488), Whiitlesford.
These woods belong
to the paper mills at
Sawston and are reached
by the loke that runs 
by the Bees in the Wall.
Fen woods, mainly of
elm, uneven-aged and
not much attended to.
Much standing water in
pools, probably lower in
summer. There are a
few old larches, fairly healthy.
Some young pines have
been planted, but some
are dying.
[5256-5257]
63. Mnium punctatum. On 
a rotten log.

[5258-5259]
Ceratodon purpureus. Rather
scarce.
Leptodictyon riparium.
Scarce on wood, within
about 1 1/2 ft of the pre-
sent water level in pools.
The level is said to be
at a maximum now.
Camptothecium sericeum.
Scarce.
Thamnium alopecurum. Locally
abundant.
Metzgeria furcata. Densely
investing a single poplar tree.
Both woods contain
large pure stands of medium-
-sized single daffodils, known
for many years (probably in 
Ray) and probably native.
They formerly occurred 
on grassland in various 
parts of the parish.
Ribes spicatum and
grossularia are local.
Armillaria occurs 
in the wood, but is not
very damaging.
Auricularia mesenterica
is very abundant, coming 
up sometimes as flat cush-
ions under bark.
A rabbit was surprised
in the wood.
Allium ursinum forms
a dense pure stand in a 
[5260-5261]
small wood on the N.E.
side of the ring road at 465,
483. A few daffodils 
occur at the wood mar-
gin.
At 465,482 is the
Ophrys muscifera field,
apparently old chalk grass-
land.
Cankers up to 1 ft
diam. are to be seen on 
poplars in the little wood at
466,479.
Near the church at 
Little Shelford is a large
gall about 20ft from the
ground on a lime tree.
It is about 8ft diam. and
consists of a condensed
branch system bearing
long straight shoots.
There is no intricate
twiggy mass as in most
galls.
Two dead rabbits were
found at Whittlesford.
April 8.
Some more rotted timber
has been brought out of
Mr Walker's rooms.
April 9.
The stump at Little 
Shelford was revisited.
About 1/3 of the surface,
roughly distributed in two 
sectors containing islands,
is characteristic of Poly-
porus squamosus (soft
yellow rot, [????] cubical,
with pockets of white
[5262-5263]
mycelium). This rot usu-
ally has a single (some-
times weakly double)
zone line where it meets
other rots. It is not it-
self subdivided by zone
lines.
April 10.
