The small wood at
Bower-house Tye, Polstead,
is coppice with standards.
The middle part of Whin-
nyfield Wood, Polstead, no
longer exists; the rest is
probably coppice with stan-
dards.

[8722-8723]

Stack Wood, Polstead, is
perhaps coppice with standards,
parts being devastate.
Hintlesham Great Wood is
possibly standards only.
Holly is frequent E. of
Hadleigh, but trunks and
big branches are frequently
dead and bleached.

12. Sph. recurvum, as 10.
weissia is abundant and
much fruiting on the larger
branches. 
Cabbage bases if left
in the ground eventually
produce several rather loose
small rosettes of edible leaves.
Physalis jam (imported

sweet bland jam in colour

many.
