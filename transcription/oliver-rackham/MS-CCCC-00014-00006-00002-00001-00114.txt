February 25 1967
To Ipswich
via Sudbury
Several flocks of lap-
wings were seen over plough-
land.
Snowdrops occur just
inside Suffolk by the banks
of the Stour at Wixoe, in
a seemingly natural situ-
ation in open country:
706436
The small wood at
Bower-house Tye, Polstead,
is coppice with standards.
The middle part of Whin-
nyfield Wood, Polstead, no
longer exists; the rest is
probably coppice with stan-
dards.

[8722-8723]

Stack Wood, Polstead, is
perhaps coppice with standards,
parts being devastate.
Hintlesham Great Wood is
possibly standards only.
Holly is frequent E. of
Hadleigh, but trunks and
big branches are frequently
dead and bleached.
February 25 57 Corder Road Ipswich
Plants are
less advanced than at
Cambridge.
February 27
The Akebia has begun
flowering.
February 28
The dark-coloured Eccremo-
carpus has produced flower
buds.
March 1
The weather continues
stormy with frequent gales.
March 2
Crocuses are in full
flower in Pembroke.
March 3
Repottig of Succulents
1. Sempervivum Multerberg[????]tas
1956. Rosettes now down
to 2, large 3/8", & one
tiny offset. ONe flowered
during the year. Reduced
by about half.
2 1/2" pot [SYMBOL] 2 1/2".
2. Big Aloe. See p. 8646.
Main rosette has 17
active leaves. 12 visible

[8724-8725]

rosettes, the largest with
8 leaves. 1 stolon not
emerged. Moved from 6"
to 7 1/2" pot. Root system
concentrated at sides of
pot but not in lower
half. Some stolons came
up at side of pot.
Has increased to nearly
double in the past year.
3. Sempervivum styriacum.
3" to 4 1/2". Pot about half
full of roots. 11 rosettes up
to 5/8". Just over doubled.
4. Sedum telephium (Cringle-
ford). 4 1/2" to 6". Pot full
of roots, mostly apparently
dead, exceedingly fine,
forming a cage round the
outside. 4 Hesperis
seedlings removed and
potted seperately.
March 4
Hepatica is in flower at
Coton.
A plum tree at Coton
was uprooted with some
difficult using a winch
and two thicknesses of
stout 1-strand fence wire.
Diameter c.11 in. Age c.
72 years. Heart-wood deep
pink, smelling of plums.
Snowdrops are well out
at Coton (along with many
other flowers).
On the ancient Queen
apple tree at Coton, Dicrano-

[8726-8727]

Bryophytes [????] (4/3/66)
5: Parmelia saxatiis: several
large patches (to c.3in. diam)
on larger branches of an
ancient Queen apple tree
at Coton.
6: Plagiothecium curvifolium,
on peat surface under birch
coppice, Flitwick (11/3/66)
7: Campylopus pyriformis ibid.
8: Pohlia nutans, wet hollow
ibid.
9. Plaguothecium denticulatum,
peat surface ibid.
10: Sphagnum fimbriatum, large
masses under light birch wood
ibid.
11. Cryptothallus mirabilis, among
the above.
12. Sph. recurvum, as 10.
weissia is abundant and
much fruiting on the larger
branches. 
Cabbage bases if left
in the ground eventually
produce several rather loose
small rosettes of edible leaves.
Physalis jam (imported
from S. Africa) is a very 
sweet bland jam in colour
and flavour resembling
pineapple, but less acid.
Pips small, soft, yellow,
many.

tion with particular atten-
tion to ditches.

[!!!!] many in other com-
partments and may reach
standard size.
Oak. Abundant in most
compartments. Stumps about
as many as in Hayley.
Elm. Several genotypes prob-
ably involved. Exclusive
only in the S.W. part of the
old wood (compartment 2).
Never appears to kill oak.
Dominant over the whole
S.W. part of the wood, [!!!!]
[!!!!] except around
the pond and in the S. part
oof Section 2, and at the
N.E. corner (Sec. 11). Abundant
around the pond and in
Sec. 10 & 12. Absent from
the N.E. part of 2 and 4, and
the whole N. quarter.
Probably an invader in
the old wood.
Hawthorn. Generally not
important Cratoegus monogyna
in the S.E. hald and oxyacan-
thiodes in the N.W. half.
Hazel. Almost throughout.
Stools usually small in the 
E. part of the wood
Privet. Frequent in the S.E.
half.
Maple. Stools frequent, large
(but not as large as in

Hayley), low. Mainly in
the N.W. half of the wood, though
it occurs in the S.E. hald
and has been recently cut
for coppice.
Sallow. Locally abundant,
up to c. 40ft high. Mainly
in an area E. of the
pond.
Anum. Abundant throughout
the Wood, especially in mercury
areas.
Deschampsia coespitosa. Not
abundant.
Helleborus. Many plants in-
cluding some small ((? young)
ones.
Crab. Only one seen, at
point 35.
Horbeam. Standards &
coppice both occur. The
standards are not appar-
ently of coppice origin.
Dryyopteris dilatata. One
plant seen at the N. end
of Section 10.
Violets. None seen.
Daphne laureola. Several
pants in recently-cut
coppice, flowering vigorously.

[8744-8745]

Birhc. One large tree in Sec.
5.
Some of this informa-
tion has been entered on maps in Hatley East file.
March 6.
Prunus spinosa is flow-
ering abundantly at Cam-
bridge.
March 7
Akebia is monoecious
Flowers in racemes, with
3 sepals and 6 stamens
or 6 carpels. Probably proto-
gynous: the top flowers in
each raceme are male,
a small number at the
bottom female.
March 8.
The Clematis was pruned,
each of the two main
branches being shortened
to about 2ft long.
March 9
Clianthus is growing slowly.
March 10
Parosiflora is flow in growing
March 11
Flitwick Moor.
The peat depth is not
normally more than 4ft.
It is dug out either in 
strips c. 4ft apart or in
rectangular basins c. 4ft
square. In either case it
is cut down to the 
underlying soft clay, which
is rather liquid.

6-9 in down. Taste
characteristic, like unripe

Watre very ferrignious &
heavily incrusting on leaves &c.
Cryptothallus was found
in many places where
looked for.Always under
large very loose tussocks
of vigorous Sphagnum. The
plant is ascending in habit,
part cream, with large
erect incipient sporophytes.
Thallus very large and thick,
not quite terete, with curious
short lateral lobes. Shrinks
and goes stiff when dry.
