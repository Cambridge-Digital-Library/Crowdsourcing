ham Cathedral is said to be
an iron pan found in the
river gravels. Some of it,
however, notably in the Despencer
alterations, is a pure sandstone
without flints, lighter than the
iron-pan; closely resembling
carr. [SYMBOL]
There is Sandringham-
carr building at Quebec
Hall, near Dereham.
The old village street in
Elmham Park is a deep hollow
with large hawthorn bushes.
[SYMBOL]. Nettles occur on the
habitation site (re-sown not
very recently) but sparsely.

[11134-11135]

1134
A thick dark gray Pertus-
aria occurs on Elmham Park
wall.
About half the corn in
Norfolk is cut.
There is comparatively little
gale damage in Norfolk.
Hockering Wood is mainly
deciduous in the S. and may
well be 3-storeyed. There
is an island of tall conifers
in the middle.
August 25. 64 H.L
The pear tree is bearing
heavily this year. The fruits
are nearly ripe. Some were
gathered.

Impatiens glandulifera
is abundant by the river
at Lenwade.
River Farm Wood, Great
Witchingham, is a possible 3-
-layered wood.
The valley of the Boston
Beck contains several in-
teresting-looking fens and
fen woods.
The woods in Swanning-
ton and Felthorpe are
similar to Mousehold, with
large areas of small pioneer
oak and apparently even-
-aged birch. Other areas
have sweet chestnut coppice,
1137
usually simple. This tree
also appears to colonize
unplanted areas.
Drayton Drewray is
largely planted with pines.
Polyporus squamosus is
flourishing on the elder
tree (still living) in the church-
yard of St George's Tombland.

Hayley Wood (with Sir Frank Engledow).
Sison: railway verge near
the entrance, several plants.
Hypericum perforatum: abun-
dant ibid.
Campanula glomerata:now
flowering, some 30 flowering
stems.
The railway tracks were
taken away recently.
Many trees are turning
brown before their time,
perhaps pathologically.There
are several such within and
at the edges of the coppice
plots, notably the larger crab
in the 1967 plot and the
1139
small maple standard in the
1968 plot.
The smaller crab in 1967
is fruiting heavily.
There is little or no sur-
face water, but on the main
ride is much mud with
Callitriche.
Carex in the 1968 plot
appears to be all acutiformis:
it has grown to a larger size
than usual this year, but is
not flowering.
Several deer footprints were
seen on the main ride.

Knapwell Wood. Visit with
G. Peterken and Dr Irwin Peck,

A large quanitity of rubbish
has accumulated near the

smouldering.

September 8.
Irpex at Coton. On an
old apple tree in the Evans
garden. About 6 in. long and
1 1/2 in. thick, erumpent from
under the bark, which it pushes
off. Bright yellow with a
salmon-pink tinge. Rather
massive, corky in texture.
The huge green gourd grows
over a decrepit apple tree; its
gigantic fruits pull the slender
stems away from the bran-
ches, but although soft and
juicy they support a weight
of several pounds.

[11152-11153]

Sedum Telephium agg.
Grown in the sarcophagus-
plan on p. 277.
Black Head. Leaves 3-4
times as long as wide,
acute, cuneate at base,
shortly stalked. Stem branched
from near base. Upper
branches widely divergent.
Flowering season long,
later infls on lower bran-

bent and rooting at nodes.
Branches in upper third only,
angle narrow. Flowering season
short, all inflo with many
bracts. Flowers large. [SYMBOL]27.
Hayley Wood. As above,
but more vigorous. Leaves
frequently sessile and
ovate at base. Branching
lower. Stem decumbent
but less rooting. FLowers
large.
Both this and the Cringle-
ford plant are S. purpurascens,

[11154-11155]

115[!!!!]4
but the Hayley plant is
more extreme.

Hippophae occurs in
abundance on the xerothermal
schist slopes below Flie[SYMBOL].

houses. One dated 1579.

(unlined), 2 aquaducts, dated
1854. At one point is a stone
fort facing Switzerland, with
musket-ports of various
shapes, including some curved

Nauders. In an open plateau.
A few old oberinntaler stone
houses.
Toll[????]n[????]th in Tirol. According
to the parish notice-board:
1. Rabies has been absent
from Tirol several decades.
2. It reappeared earlier this
1157
year in a fox in Bezirk
Reutte.
3. Bez. Reutte has been declared
a special area.
(a) Foxes, badgers, martens
to be shot. Several thousand
foxes and a few of the other
[????]pp killed already. 60 foxes
found to be rabid.
(b) Dogs to be tied up &
cats kept in. Roaming dogs
& dubious cats to be shot.
(c) Other animals if suspected
to be shot.
(d) Transport of beasts of
prey prohibited.

the Inn, and the rest of Tirol
N. of the Inn and Sanna

and all Stanzertal. Foxes &c.
to be shot if possible.
Hippophae is frequent on
the N. side of Engiadina Bassa
between the frontier an Susch.
In the Lower Engadine
(Martina to Larin) parcels are
being marked out presumably
for aerial survey with white
papers on the corner posts.
The open land is almost
entirely hay-fields. Seldom
above 1/2 acre, usually squarish
but sometimes terraced. Boun-
daries not always evident, but
consisting usually of baulks
about 9in. wide and mown
some 6in. high. They become
1159
invaded by small bushes.
The system is similar to that
in Val Dantercepies.
The way up to Nauders
was most exciting because the
bus driver had been rudely
overtaken by a German in a
Mercedes and was determined
to get his own back by over-
taking, which he did at high
speed on this tortuous road
with Finsterm[SYMBOL]nz far below. For-
tunately I was the only passen-
ger.
Most of the lower Engadine
villages have one or more short
square towers, ruined (Steinsberg,
Ardez) or built into houses
(Susch).

The N.W. to N. facing
slopes S. of the Sp[SYMBOL]l bridge and
in the W. part of "selva" are
also terraced. There are E.
facing terraces on the other
side at "S[SYMBOL]sa" and Chans".
Terracing is fairly general
in the Zernez basin, but used
only on S. facing slopes. On
the way up to Pras[SYMBOL]ra the
1187
terraces are partly grass and
partly coniferous forrest, but the
flora of the terrace banks
remains even under trees:
abundant Polemonium, Berberis,
and other spp of type F.
Berberideto-Rosetum
appears to be the natural
vegetation on all aspects on
sites that are not wooded
and not heavily grazed. Pre-
sumably mainly secondary to
woodland.

The woods on the Pras[SYMBOL]ra

The Latschen form is
