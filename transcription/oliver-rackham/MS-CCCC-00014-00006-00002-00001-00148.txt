carr building at Quebec
Hall, near Dereham.

The woods in Swanning-
ton and Felthorpe are
similar to Mousehold, with
large areas of small pioneer

also appears to colonize
unplanted areas.

in the 1967 plot and the
1139
small maple standard in the
1968 plot.
The smaller crab in 1967
is fruiting heavily.
There is little or no sur-
face water, but on the main
