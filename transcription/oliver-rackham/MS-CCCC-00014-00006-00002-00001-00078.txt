5. Amnillariella
mellea. Abun-
dant on stumps of all kinds,
mainly hard-
woods, and often
on living hardwood trees.
A Hallimaschbaum was
found in the Wildsee Urwala.
A medium-sized beech tree
has two trunks one dead,
the other living. Toadstools
are very abundant round
the base of the tree and
to a height of about 6ft
on both trunks. They are
on one side only of the living
trunk, where much of the 
bark is coming away, with
rhizomorphs underneath.

(Sept.20)The thermophilous commu-
nities of the Kaiserstuhl are
well developed all round
the Oberbergen valley espe-
cially on the Mondhalde.
They are surprisingly indepen-
dent of aspect. Different spp
have different ranges. The
widest ranges are those of
Aster arnellus (from the Ihr-
ingen vineyards right through
to the Katharinaberg) and
Dianthus carthusianorum
(mainly on Mondhalde, but
descends via the Katharina-
berg to the Amoltererheide
and nearly into Endingen).
Quercus pubescens seems
to be confined to the
slopes between Oberbergen
and Neunlinden, but oaks
with a strong pubescens ten-
dency are frequent in
wood margins all along
the Mondhalde and Katharina-
berg. Linosyris has a narrow
range, being confined to
the Mondhalde and usu-
[6282-6283]
ally associated with Eryngium
and Trinia. Anthericum
has nearly as wide a
range as Aster, and is
particularly frequent on
N. facing slopes. Silene otites,
Asperula tinctoria, and Artemi-
sia campestris have narrow
ranges.
Campanula media is
naturalized on disturbed
dry slopes near Oberbergen.
Trinia has a rather
restricted range on the Mond-
halde, but one plant was
seen in the Ihringen vine-
yards.
Arjuga chamaepitys is rare
in the [!!!!]Mondhalde[!!!!]Oberbergen vineyards.
Erigeron acris is scarce
around Oberbergen.
Malva moschata was
found on a dry slope near
Oberbergen.
Cytisus sagittalis is
restricted to dry slopes
on the Katharinaberg, with
no other thermophils save
Kohlrauschia (also confined
to this district), Dianthus
carthusianorum, and Aster.
6(Sept.21). Frequent in the
woods around the Feldsee,
in small groups. ⅞ in. high.
Branched irregularly, mainly
in the upper half. Tips
many, short, very fine, ein-
seitwendig. Pale cream with
a purplish tinge, blackening
[6284-6285]
at the base, especially with age.
[DIAG]
(Sept.21).
Ptilium
pulcherrimum
is the most
abundant
bark bryophyte
in the Feldberg
district. Lichens
are few; mainly Evernia spp.
Usnea and Lobaria were not
seen.
On Grafenmatt are areas
of boggy grassland looking
superficially very like the
Ölztaler Bückelwiesen. The
general surface is a Molini-
etum, with scattered hum-
mocks of Vaccinium. The
latter, however, appear to
be always based on
old stumps. Small spruce
trees often grow on them.
In the same place,
a small spruce tree cut
off near the base (c.4ft
from the ground, where it is
c. [????]in. diam.) is regenera-
ting from several branches.
Cytisus sagittalis is
locally abundant in the
grassy moorland of [!!!!]Grafe[!!!!] Her-
zogenhorn.
Polygonum bistorta is
scarce in the Grafenmatt
bogs.
Cirsium acaule grows
very sparingly by the Feldsee
Impatiens nolitangere
[6286-6287]
was found by a flush
in the woods on the E.
facing cliffs of the Feldsee.
Plants small, rather poor,
in light shade of conifers.
Seed production very small.
7 (Sept. 21). Armillaria mellea
Frequent in the Feldsee
woods, mainly on stumps.
Bazzania trilobata is
frequent in the Feldsee
woods, especially the Urwald
type.
Sambucus racemosa is
frequent in light woods and
the edge thereof in the
Feldberg district.
6 (Sept.23). Flammula (Gymno-
pilus) sapinea. One on a
fallen log, Wildseewald.
The forneo (p.6266, n[SYMBOL]. 2)
lives for several years. A
log was found which had
fallen since the sporo-
phores were first developed.
A new set of tubes was
produced on a small pileus
at right angles to the
first.
[DIAG]
[6288-6289]
7(Sept.23). Many, frequently
in very large groups, on
rotten beech logs, Wild-
see. 1½ (long) x ¾ (wide).
P. laterally sessile,
obovate, white, smooth, matt,
humid.
L. thin, crowded, narrow,
adnate, white.
C. thin, white, fungus
smell.
[DIAG]
Pleurotus
dryinus.
[!!!!] certain.

8(Sept.23). A mass about
3 in. diam. on a conifer
stump, Wildsee Urwald. A
branched resupinate Erina-
ceus.
Branches many from a
common centre, sparingly
and irregularly branched
again, ultimate
[DIAG]
[6290-6291]
branches tending to turn
downwards. Spines of the
same texture as the branches,
[SYMBOL] in. long, very acute,
straight down, mostly on
the ends of the branches
but not confined thereto.
Whole fungus white,
pink-tinged, yellowish when
old.
C. soft, fleshy, faint
fungus smell.
September 24
Cirsium oleraceum is
frequent in Kinzigtal and
upper Nagoldtal.
Carlina acaulis is fre-
quent on dry banks
with juniper in the lime-
stone country around Hoch-
dorf.
Sambucus ebulus was
seen near Nagold.
September 25.
[DIAG]
1. Armillaria
mellea. Frequent on stumps
in Wimberg woods. Does
not appear to attack living
trees.
2. Hypholoma fasciculare.
Rather frequent on stumps
ibid.
3. Calocera viscosa. Fre-
quent on stumps, roots,
and buried wood.
September 26.
Cirsium oleraceum is
frequent on grassy road-
[6292-6293]
sides in the forest.
September 27.
Sambucus racemosa is
the commonest sp. here.
September 28.
1. A large troop in the
spruce forest on the way
to Zavelstein. 6-2-1⅛

very concave, margin convex,
smooth, sticky, [SYMBOL] shiny.
S. paler, whitish on the
surface, cylindric, smooth,

of one length, occasionally
forked near the base, ad-
nate. Milk abundant, white,
in about 50 sec. bright
lemon - to sulphur-yellow.

ly changing colour be-
cause of the milk, some-
what peppery (taste slow-
ly developing).

2. A troop in mixed (beech
& conifers) forest, near Zavel-
stein. 4½-2½-[SYMBOL].
P. flat, slightly umbo-
nate, hygrophanous, smooth,
humid. wet: dark brown
in centre, through brownish
gray to smoky gray at the
margin. Dry: ochraceous
tendency in the lighter
parts, umbo remaining
vandyck. Partly covered(in
curious marbly patches)
with a remarkable rather
firmly attached pruina,
recalling the salt ef-
florescence on boots after
wetting and drying.
S. slightly bulbous based,
pale smokey gray, smorth,
matt, hollow, fleshy with
a pronounced fibrous cortex.
L. thin, crowded, some
incomplete, dirty cream-
-white, slightly decurrent.

late, irregular, margin incurred,
with anastomosing grooves

salmon pink both sides,

tween Calw and Zavelstein.
