5. Amnillariella
mellea. Abun-
dant on stumps of all kinds,
mainly hard-
woods, and often
on living hardwood trees.
A Hallimaschbaum was
found in the Wildsee Urwala.
A medium-sized beech tree
has two trunks one dead,
the other living. Toadstools
are very abundant round
the base of the tree and
to a height of about 6ft
on both trunks. They are
on one side only of the living
trunk, where much of the 
bark is coming away, with
rhizomorphs underneath.

(Sept.20)The thermophilous commu-
nities of the Kaiserstuhl are
well developed all round
the Oberbergen valley espe-
cially on the Mondhalde.
They are surprisingly indepen-
dent of aspect. Different spp
have different ranges. The
widest ranges are those of
Aster arnellus (from the Ihr-
ingen vineyards right through
to the Katharinaberg) and
Dianthus carthusianorum
(mainly on Mondhalde, but
descends via the Katharina-
berg to the Amoltererheide
and nearly into Endingen).
Quercus pubescens seems
to be confined to the
slopes between Oberbergen
and Neunlinden, but oaks
with a strong pubescens ten-
dency are frequent in
wood margins all along
the Mondhalde and Katharina-
berg. Linosyris has a narrow
range, being confined to
the Mondhalde and usu-
[6282-6283]
ally associated with Eryngium
and Trinia. Anthericum
has nearly as wide a
range as Aster, and is
particularly frequent on
N. facing slopes. Silene otites,
Asperula tinctoria, and Artemi-
sia campestris have narrow
ranges.
Campanula media is
naturalized on disturbed
dry slopes near Oberbergen.
Trinia has a rather
restricted range on the Mond-
halde, but one plant was
seen in the Ihringen vine-
yards.
Arjuga chamaepitys is rare
in the [!!!!]Mondhalde[!!!!] Oberbergen vineyards.
Erigeron acris is scarce
around Oberbergen.
Malva moschata was
found on a dry slope near
Oberbergen.
Cytisus sagittalis is
restricted to dry slopes
on the Katharinaberg, with
no other thermophils save
Kohlrauschia (also confined
to this district), Dianthus
carthusianorum, and Aster.
6(Sept.21). Frequent in the
woods around the Feldsee,
in small groups. ⅞ in. high.
Branched irregularly, mainly
in the upper half. Tips
many, short, very fine, ein-
seitwendig. Pale cream with
a purplish tinge, blackening
[6284-6285]
at the base, especially with age.
[DIAG]
(Sept.21).
Ptilium
pulcherrimum
is the most
abundant
bark bryophyte
in the Feldberg
district. Lichens
are few; mainly Evernia spp.
Usnea and Lobaria were not
seen.
On Grafenmatt are areas
of boggy grassland looking
superficially very like the
Ölztaler Bückelwiesen. The
general surface is a Molini-
etum, with scattered hum-
mocks of Vaccinium. The
latter, however, appear to
be always based on
old stumps. Small spruce
trees often grow on them.
In the same place,
a small spruce tree cut
off near the base (c.4ft
from the ground, where it is
c. [????]in. diam.) is regenera-
ting from several branches.
Cytisus sagittalis is
locally abundant in the
grassy moorland of [!!!!]Grafe[!!!!] Her-
zogenhorn.
Polygonum bistorta is
scarce in the Grafenmatt
bogs.
Cirsium acaule grows
very sparingly by the Feldsee
Impatiens nolitangere
[6286-6287]
was found by a flush
in the woods on the E.
facing cliffs of the Feldsee.
Plants small, rather poor,
in light shade of conifers.
Seed production very small.
7 (Sept. 21). Armillaria mellea
Frequent in the Feldsee
woods, mainly on stumps.
Bazzania trilobata is
frequent in the Feldsee
woods, especially the Urwald
type.
Sambucus racemosa is
frequent in light woods and
the edge thereof in the
Feldberg district.
6 (Sept.23). Flammula (Gymno-
pilus) sapinea. One on a
fallen log, Wildseewald.
The forneo (p.6266, n[SYMBOL]. 2)
lives for several years. A
log was found which had
fallen since the sporo-
phores were first developed.
A new set of tubes was
produced on a small pileus
at right angles to the
first.
[DIAG]
[6288-6289]
7(Sept.23). Many, frequently
in very large groups, on
rotten beech logs, Wild-

straight down, mostly on
the ends of the branches
but not confined thereto.

old.
C. soft, fleshy, faint
fungus smell.
September 24
Cirsium oleraceum is
frequent in Kinzigtal and
upper Nagoldtal.

stone country around Hoch-
dorf.

gray to smoky gray at the
margin. Dry: ochraceous

vandyck. Partly covered(in
curious marbly patches)

recalling the salt ef-
florescence on boots after

matt, hollow, fleshy with
a pronounced fibrous cortex.
L. thin, crowded, some
incomplete, dirty cream-

[DIAG]
Phlegmacium traganum. [????]
certain.
[DIAG]
Ants' nests seem to
be more frequent on the ed-
ges of the wood. There are
several large ones by the
road which skirts the wood
N. of the Wimberg estate.
The ants are very warlike
and sting canvas shoes.
No smell was detected.
Dicranum rugosum (267)
was found again, on a
hummock in the drier part
of the Teichelwald bog, in
[6312-6313]
light shade with Leucobryum.
The white form of Ver-
bascum palverulentum is
abundant on Burg Waldeck
in disturbed ground (Sept.29).
Euphrasia ericetorum is
abundant on dry banks at
Neubulach, and occasionally
bears an orange rust (Sept.
29).
Trifolium incarnatum
occurs on a roadside at

are colourless when fresh.
October 3.
Dune Flora, Hook of Holland.
L. Waste ground near town.
Rosa rugosa abundant
freq. planted. Resists salt
spray very well.
Diplotaxis muralis: v. ab
phleum arenarium: disturbed
ground.
Eryngium campestre(sic).
Hippophae rhamnoides.
Elymus
2. Blowouts on the seaward
side of the great dune
ridge. The seaward edge
of the dunes is continually
shifting, with fierce blowouts.
Marram is the chief colon-
izer. It is not planted,
but the sand is stabilized
by "planting" tufts of dried
reeds.
3. Stable dunes on the sea-
[6314-6315]
ward side of the great
ridge.
Hippophae: abundant, in
large low thickets, but
burnt in places.
Senecio*: abundant, and
seemingly naturalized in
places.
Populus alba: forms dense
low thickets. The bushes
are much out back by
the wind, and have by
now lost most of their
leaves. Attempts at planting
aspens and sycamores in
the town have largely failed,
the seaward branches
dying off, and sometimes the
whole tree dying.
Rosa rugosa: mainly near
the town.
In S.E. Holland, W. of
Venlo, there are considerable
areas of unreclaimed marsh.
Most of this appears to be
Molinietum. There is much
birch wood, but most of the
trees are dead, perhaps of a
change in the water level.
There are large areas
of reed fen near Einthoven,
and some of this is cut
for thatch &c.
