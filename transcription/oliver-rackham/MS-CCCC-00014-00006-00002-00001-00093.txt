Doubtful. P. cuticularis is too

zoinus is too pale, and has
a characteristic smell; some
other spp are too hard. Apparen-
tly not the same as Fomes
cryptarum of Ramsbottom Mush.

[DIAG]

[7550-7551]

[DIAG]
Polyporus giganteus.
Almost certain.
41. Scleroderma aurantium.
Occasional. Per. turns pale
pink within c. 30 sec. of 
being cut.
42. One in the Menilius
corium copse. A mysterious
and formless mass, some 2 1/2 ft
long and 6 in. wide, appar-
ently on buried wood. In-
corporating beech leaves and 
litter.
P. absent.
P.S. covering the whole
sporophore, except for 
ridges on the upper surface
which lack P. all over
highly convoluted. Above
ground. White, directed side-
ways or upward. Below
ground, where exposed in
cavities in the litter, salmon
pink, directed downward. P.
small (0.2 mm), thick-walled,
round. T. less than 1 mm,
concolorous.
C. corky, zoned, cream,
smelling of Fomes or Gano-

[7552-7553]

derma.
[DIAG]
43. Several under lime trees
in a belt near the Round
Clump, and perhaps else-
where. Diam. of recurved [!!!!] expanded [!!!!]
Exp. 2 1/2; of Endo. 1 1/4.
Exo. splitting to about
3/4 way into 6 broad acute
lobes, expanded, then recurved,
thick, rigid, firm. Ectexo
thin, papery, chestnut. Endexo
thick, fleshy, firm, chestnut,
soon cracking [SYMBOL] concentrically
but not forming a collar
as in G. triplex.
Endo. globose, papery, pale
dull brownish, smooth, matt.
Mouth very large, fimbriate,
ill-defined, pale. Endo.
definitely contracted towards
the base.
Geaster rufescens
44. In several places.
Near the site of G. forni-
catus; in the belt going
down to the Round Clump,
and in the Round Clump
itself; in the woods below
the Buried Gods, and else-
where in the belt along

[7554-7555]

the Haverhill road. Always
under beech. Usually in
rings; in the Round Cump
a ring some 30ft square
with about 20 sporophores.
The sporotphore forms in the 
upper mull layer and
works itself out by the
actio of the Exo. By
brushing away the litter, the
holes in which sporophores
were formed can be found.
It is very similar in
size and appearance to the
preceding, but differs thus:
Lobes shorter. Endexo. forms
a collar about the Endo.
Endo. not contracted at the
base, with a concolorous
or zoned, better-defined, mouth.
45. Astraeus hygrometricus.
One in the Round Clump.
