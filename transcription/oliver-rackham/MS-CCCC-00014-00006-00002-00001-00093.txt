[DIAG]

[7548-7549]

Polyporus cryptarum.
Doubtful. P. cuticularis is too
thin and C. too pale; P. ben-
zoinus is too pale, and has
a characteristic smell; some
other spp are too hard. Apparen-
tly not the same as Fomes
cryptarum of Ramsbottom Mush.

41. Scleroderma aurantium.
Occasional. Per. turns pale
pink within c. 30 sec. of 
being cut.
42. One in the Menilius
corium copse. A mysterious

long and 6 in. wide, appar-
ently on buried wood. In-
corporating beech leaves and 
litter.
P. absent.
P.S. covering the whole
sporophore, except for

highly convoluted. Above
ground. White, directed side-
ways or upward. Below
ground, where exposed in
cavities in the litter, salmon
pink, directed downward. P.
small (0.2 mm), thick-walled,
round. T. less than 1 mm,
concolorous.
C. corky, zoned, cream,
smelling of Fomes or Gano-

[7552-7553]

derma.
[DIAG]
43. Several under lime trees
in a belt near the Round
Clump, and perhaps else-
where. Diam. of recurved [!!!!] expanded [!!!!]

Exo. splitting to about
3/4 way into 6 broad acute
lobes, expanded, then recurved,
thick, rigid, firm. Ectexo
thin, papery, chestnut. Endexo
thick, fleshy, firm, chestnut,
soon cracking [SYMBOL] concentrically
but not forming a collar
as in G. triplex.
Endo. globose, papery, pale
dull brownish, smooth, matt.
Mouth very large, fimbriate,
ill-defined, pale. Endo.
definitely contracted towards
the base.
Geaster rufescens
44. In several places.
Near the site of G. forni-
catus; in the belt going
down to the Round Clump,
and in the Round Clump
itself; in the woods below
the Buried Gods, and else-
where in the belt along

[7554-7555]

the Haverhill road. Always
under beech. Usually in
rings; in the Round Cump
a ring some 30ft square
with about 20 sporophores.
The sporotphore forms in the 
upper mull layer and
works itself out by the
actio of the Exo. By
brushing away the litter, the
holes in which sporophores
were formed can be found.
It is very similar in
size and appearance to the
preceding, but differs thus:
Lobes shorter. Endexo. forms
a collar about the Endo.
Endo. not contracted at the
base, with a concolorous
or zoned, better-defined, mouth.
45. Astraeus hygrometricus.
One in the Round Clump.

October 24 Hayley Wood
1. Lactarius subdulcis. One
under an oak near the
"Hayley Ditch"
2. Mycena gelericulta. Abun-
dant on stumps and
oak branches felled in
1914-18.
3. Spinellus macrocarpus. On
the L. of the above. On
being kept moist for a few
days, it forms abundant
brilliant sporangiophores
up to 1 1/8 in. long with
minute sporangia. These
sprout from the P. as well
as the L., but not the S.,
nor adjoining fungi of other 
spp.

ochre, decurrent.
C. thinnish, white, slightly
and slowly pink-tinged. Milk
copious, white quickly and
painfully peppery.
[diag]
Lactarius cir-
cellatus. Almost
certain.

[7562-7563]

7. Camarophyllus niveus. A
small group in the south
quarter. Quite large (2-2-3/8)
but unlikely to be virgineus
because teh C. is very thin.
Orton says of both spp. "mostly
in fields but occasioally in
woods, probably originally pasture-
land"
8. A large group just inside the
old boundary ditch on the N.E.
ride. 5 1/2-3-1. Overlapping.
P. flat, very irregular
and somewhat wavy, umber,
slightly innately fibrillose,
matt, clammy.

There seems to have been
no frost yet
October 28
Lyophyllum ulmarium. One
hugh in a big snag of an
elm tree near the Observa-
tory.
October 29
Fomes pomaceus. A white
erumpent mass shows the
beginning of a sporophore
at the base of the great
pear tree in the Bursar's

[7566-7567]

garden. It is difficult to
see how this could be a 
branch infection, as the
trynk is clear of branches
for the first 15ft or so.
October 30
Rhytidindelphus squamosus
is abundant in much of
the middle lawns of Leck-
hampton.
October 31
A wild day with severe gales and rain.
November 1
Again a wild day. The
only damage seems to have
been a branch spilt off a
elm in the Backs, which was
due to an inclded pocket
of bark in the fork.
November 2
A fine calm day
November 3 The Brack
A very clear calm day.
Heavy frost in the preceding 
night, with air temperatures
many degrees below freezing.
Frost persistted in sheltered
places on teh Breck all
day. It seems to have
been universal, even under
trees, and the air temper-
ature remained below
freezing most of the day.
