[SYMBOL]  31 JULY 1975 
Cley Shingle Ridge
   Silene m[?????]: big isolated 
pu[????]ines on unstable shingle
of about 1' dia.
   So[????]us aviensis frequently 
grows in these patches. Also 
Festuca rubra and 
Agropyron pungens. 
  So[????]us is capable also 
of growing up through shingle.

  Much clonal variation in 
Silene.
  Rx crispus grows also in
Silene patches, but frequently 
by itself. Much damaged
by spray. 

  Suaeda o[????]g infrequently 
very high on the shingle ridge, 
  
[17222-17223]
almost to the crest. One 
such plant excavated appears 
to have been pushed landward 
by successive burials. 
  
Senecio jacobaea occasional,
chiefly in rather stabilized 
places. 
Limonium vulgare rare on 
stabilized shingle well above the 
marsh. 
Plantago maritima usually 
among Silene. Much grazed 
by rabbits.
Sedum [????] occ. on more 
stable shingle.

Honckenya peploides infreq. 

  This description is of the first
half-mile of Blakeney Point to the W. 
of the coastguard station. Very unlike 
Scolt Head Island. Consists of a 
rather steep narrow ridge of coarse 
pebbles about 1" dia.; no sand-
-dunes, very little fine material at 
all. Various irregular ridges and 
hollows. The degree of stability of the 
shingle varies. 
   Behind the ridge is a narrow 
fringe of salt-marsh dominated by 
Limonium vulgare. Lower levels 
of the marsh not represented. 
   Cley and Blakeney Eyes are 
clearly visible as low hills in the 
fresh-marshes.  Short grassland. 
No remains of the chapels to be 
seen. 
   Cover of higher plants is never 
complete, even on stable shingle.

           Sampling barley on 
           stripes at Grime's Graves. 
August 2. 
   Near the Adelaide (Ely) 
is a remarkable sight, of 
a large asparagus bed 
overrun with Calystegio which 
has climbed up and over-
whelmed many of the tall plants. 

   Barley at Grime's Graves. 
0.13 chain. soil pit about 
1m. to S. with marker.
O is W. end of chain. 
0.10 ch. is opposite rack. 
0.62 ch. is about 20 c[????] N. 
of soil pit and marker. 

Sample row is 1.0 chain 
from rabbit fence. 
Chain is about 1.2 links 
longer than distance beteween 
markers. 

[17226-17227]
Freak ear     [DIAG]
of barley in 
this sample: 
two pairs of 
spikelets
from the 
same nodes, 
and two
gaps in the 
rhackis.
  The object 
was to collect 
as close as
possible to the 
transect sampled last year. 
   D.E. Coombe's direction for finding
the place are given opposite. 
   Rabbit damage was avoided
in placing the transect.

On this very hot cloudless day
a branch some 6 in. dia. fell
                     young

Severe wilting & browning 
of birch is widespread in the 
Woking-Aldershot area. 
   The big beech at Fanshawe 
has lost its leaves from 
several feet of the topmost 
twigs: this has happened in 
the last few weeks, the tree
having previously been quite 
healthy. 

Great Bottom. 
   A pair of Victorian cottages, now 
made into the Evanses' house, and
another just adapted into Mrs 
Ridley's. Also a hovel, a tin barn 
with remains of creosoting plant, 
and a derelict orchard. No evidence 
of ancient settlement. Small 
group of elms.

August 8. 
   Michael Stratton's Estates. 
   Has been in the family 3 
generations. 

[DIAG]

[17238-17239]
  The house at Stockton Manor 
is one of 3 built in the parish 
by wealthy merchants in the late 
16th cent. Interiors mostly 
Georgian; roof partly original. 
Apparently incorporates a small 
earlier building. Walls of Chilmark
stone. 
   Magnificent garden and walled 
orchard. 
   The stables are a cruck 
building, the upper floor being 
recently made into a room for 
games and meetings. 
   There is also a large 
timber-framed barn on a high 
stone plinth formerly larger, 
now somewhat dilapidated. 
Thatched. 

   Most of the estate is cereals,
mainly barley. There is also a 
dairy farm at [????]Stockton. The only 
sheep are at Great Bottom. 
   The estate includes most of 
the parish of Codford St Mary. 
Arable, mainly cereals, in great 
hedgeless fields on former downland.
Several small conifer plantations, 
including one newly set on a steep
slope. 
   The Codford Circle is a hilltop
earthwork. 
   Most of Stockton parish above 
the railway is also in the estate. 
Almost wholly arable, save for the 
steep S.W. facing slope of Great 
Bottom, which is chalk grassland
and scrub, and various small 
patches of scrub and oaks on Stock-

 
[17240-17241]
ton Down, relics of more extensive 
scrubland before the war. 
   Michael Stratton has a flock 
of several hundred sheep on the 
triangle between High Grove, Great
Ridge, and Great Bottom. They 
are on rotation grassland, but
have access to the chalk grass-
land and scrub on the S.W. facing 
scarp of Great Bottom. Not normally 
attended. 
   Michael Stratton showed us his 
exotic trees planted in Stockton
Wood, and took us to see the 
chalk-heath in Great Ridge and
the hidden valley of Snail-creep
Hanging.
Stockton Earthworks. Grazed by 
cattle. Very complex; [????]quite good con-
dition, though vegetation coarser 
than well-grazed chalk grassland.
