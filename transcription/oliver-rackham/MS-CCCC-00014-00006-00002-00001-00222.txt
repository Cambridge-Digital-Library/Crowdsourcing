Cley Shingle Ridge
   Silene m[?????]: big isolated 
pu[????]ines on unstable shingle
of about 1' dia.
   So[????]us aviensis frequently 
grows in these patches. Also 
Festuca rubra and 
Agropyron pungens. 
  So[????]us is capable also 
of growing up through shingle.

  Much clonal variation in 
Silene.
  Rx crispus grows also in
Silene patches, but frequently 
by itself. Much damaged
by spray. 

  Suaeda o[????]g infrequently 
very high on the shingle ridge, 
  
[17222-17223]
almost to the crest. One 
such plant excavated appears 
to have been pushed landward 
by successive burials. 
  
Senecio jacobaea occasional,
chiefly in rather stabilized 
places. 
Limonium vulgare rare on 
stabilized shingle well above the 
marsh. 
Plantago maritima usually 
among Silene. Much grazed 
by rabbits.
Sedum [????] occ. on more 
stable shingle.

Honckenya peploides infreq. 

  This description is of the first
half-mile of Blakeney Point to the W. 
of the coastguard station. Very unlike 
Scolt Head Island. Consists of a 
rather steep narrow ridge of coarse 
pebbles about 1" dia.; no sand-
-dunes, very little fine material at 
all. Various irregular ridges and 
hollows. The degree of stability of the 
shingle varies. 
   Behind the ridge is a narrow 
fringe of salt-marsh dominated by 
Limonium vulgare. Lower levels 
of the marsh not represented. 
   Cley and Blakeney Eyes are 
clearly visible as low hills in the 
fresh-marshes.  Short grassland. 
No remains of the chapels to be 
seen. 
   Cover of higher plants is never 
complete, even on stable shingle.

   Michael Stratton's Estates. 
   Has been in the family 3 
generations. 

[DIAG]

[17238-17239]
  The house at Stockton Manor 
is one of 3 built in the parish 
by wealthy merchants in the late 
16th cent. Interiors mostly 
Georgian; roof partly original. 
Apparently incorporates a small 
earlier building. Walls of Chilmark
stone. 
   Magnificent garden and walled 
orchard. 
   The stables are a cruck 
building, the upper floor being 
recently made into a room for 
games and meetings. 
   There is also a large 
timber-framed barn on a high 
stone plinth formerly larger, 
now somewhat dilapidated. 
Thatched. 

   Most of the estate is cereals,
mainly barley. There is also a 
dairy farm at [????]Stockton. The only 
sheep are at Great Bottom. 
   The estate includes most of 
the parish of Codford St Mary. 
Arable, mainly cereals, in great 
hedgeless fields on former downland.
Several small conifer plantations, 
including one newly set on a steep
slope. 
   The Codford Circle is a hilltop
earthwork. 
   Most of Stockton parish above 
the railway is also in the estate. 
Almost wholly arable, save for the 
steep S.W. facing slope of Great 
Bottom, which is chalk grassland
and scrub, and various small 
patches of scrub and oaks on Stock-

 
[17240-17241]
ton Down, relics of more extensive 
scrubland before the war. 
   Michael Stratton has a flock 
of several hundred sheep on the 
triangle between High Grove, Great
Ridge, and Great Bottom. They 
are on rotation grassland, but
have access to the chalk grass-
land and scrub on the S.W. facing 
scarp of Great Bottom. Not normally 
attended. 
   Michael Stratton showed us his 
exotic trees planted in Stockton
Wood, and took us to see the 
chalk-heath in Great Ridge and
the hidden valley of Snail-creep
Hanging.
Stockton Earthworks. Grazed by 
cattle. Very complex; [????]quite good con-

   Covers about 5 acres of steep
hillside around 958367. Density 
very variable. Bushes get taller and
more dense lower on the slope and
species other than juniper predomi-
nate, especially ash. The bottom
of the valley is occupied by a belt
of middle-aged beeches, evidently 
planted; there is no tendency for 
beech to colonize the scrub. 
   Juniper bushes vary greatly in
habit; [????]from[????] the commonest shapes 
are columnar and vase-shaped, 
but there is a continuous range. 
To some extent the columnar 
bushes become more floppy when 
old. 
   There is not much turnover of 
juniper; few young bushes, though
some old ones sprout from the base. 
In the oldest scrub, developing into 
ash woodland, there are a few dead
junipers. 

[17244-17245]
   There is a strong tendency for 
other spp to arise out of the middle
of junipers; privet is perhaps the 
commonest to do this. Usually
the juniper remains alive. [SYMBOL]9 etc. 
   The community seems to be 
rather stable. Intensive sheep acti-
vity (and erosion by trampling)
prevent further establishment of 
bushes. The oldest ashes (except
at the foor of the slope) appear 
to be about 20 years old.

   There was a spectacular

lightning and thunder probably

   Near Stockton Earthworks, at

tain, but it could be the tree 
mentioned by Colt Hoare on this 
or a nearby barrow. 
   There is no tendency for 
beech-woods to develop on chalk 
in this area. This and other
planted beeches do not give 
rise to saplings. 

   Soil in Great Bottom is a very
thin rendzina: planning brings up 
chalk fragments. Slightly more 
fines on little terrace where the 
houses stand. Above the houses
the track, perhaps an ancient 
highway to Chilmark, becomes 
a rocky ravine. 
   On the S.W. facing slope are 
several banks of Celtic fields.

The bank at the bottom of the

seems to be a natural spring 
at its last junction with a

   Telephone cable being laid

difficulty in doing this, even

of chalk boulders near the 
surface. Hardly possible to get 
the cable below plough depth. 
The men contrived to cut the 
water-pipe to reat Bottom in 
the process. 
   Until the plough-up after 
the last war Celtic fields are 
said to have been very extensive
