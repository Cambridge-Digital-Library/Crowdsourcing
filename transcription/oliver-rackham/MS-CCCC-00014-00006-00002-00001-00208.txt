Botanic Gardens
The new Ailanthus on the site of
the big old one, probably a sucker,
has reached about 11/2ft high.
Base of big branch of old tree  - 96±2 rings
Cladonia pocillum. Abundant
on rocks of the sandstone rock 
garden.

Cypropedium  One plant in flower
of each of:
C. calceolus
C. calceolus v. pubescens
C. acaule

Trillium kamschatkicum. Sterile,
looks very like a large 3-leaved
Paris.

[16230-16231]

Opuntia has survived the winter
in the limestone rock garden.

Gunnera.  One infl. has a
slight terminal fasciation.

Sequoia semper.  Almost totally
brown. Has made very little
growth in recent years.  (Tree by
the lake.)

28 May.
  Devil's Ditch - Reach to Mil-
denhall railway.
Blue butterrfly seen.
several Tortoi, Gu White,
Orange Tip.

Profile  Completely preserved
in the two end quarters.
6231
In the middle half, the
fields extend down into the
fosse;  the worst place (2/3 way
from Reach) is thus:
    [DIAG]
Bushes.  For the length of
the last field from Reach on
the Burwell side the whole
bank and most of thr ditch
are free of bushes, largely
through recent clearing.  The
ditch between the road &
bank towards Reach is grassed.
Otherwise almost completely
bushed over.  The path is
much used;  it varies from
[16232-16233]
c. 10ft wide to the state
in which the bushes have to
be pushed aside. Much
clearing in the last winter.
  From the railway to the
next road the whole Burwell
slopes and part of the Swaffham
slope are clear.  Beyond the
next road the whole earthwork
is clear save for bushes scat-
tered on the Burwell slope.
  Old railway still largely
grassland: bushes much in-
creasing on the N. side.
  Hawthorn almost pure. 
Some Rosa canina. Rhamnus
rare.  Privet formns an under-
storey in many places.  Ivy
carpet evertywwere that bushes
are well established.
6233
Prunus spi9n. freq.
Viburn. lent. rare

Chalk grassland
  Large area near the rail-
way.  Otherwise only a
few patches up to c. 10 yds
across.  Some of them rescued
by recent felling.
Brachypodium pinn.
Bromus erecltus
Sainfoia
Poterium sangui
Helianthemum
Pilosella
Hippocrepis

  For the last stretch before
the railway there are remains
of a hawthorn hedge on a 
small bank
[DIAG]
Much regrowth, esp. privet, in
cleared areas.

  Lithospermum arv.  3
plants close together bout 100
yds from railway.

places around rhe roots of a
great ash tree.  Much muddied
by cattle.
  Possible slight early elm

U. procera showing signs of
previous atrtack, swaffham Prior

  Thunderstorm in the evening -
lightening not very close.  Rain

One of the sycamores in
the back of Newnham College
is only just comng into leaf
-- Armillaria attack?
Wimpole Avenue.
6343
  Much variation in leafing
times of different elms - some
local carpinif., some probably
proc.  All appear healthy ex-
cept two dead ones in the 2nd
row from the E. about 100 yds
N. of the road.

  A horizontal branch c.9in. dia.
has fallen off one of the two
young-mature Ulmus procera
in Newnham Coll. at the angle 
Grange Road-Sidgwick Avenue.
Large wet-wood cylinder but
apparently no other decay.  Prob-
ably fell off due to weight
of rain without wind.

3 June.
  With Cambridge Conservasion Corps
scouring King's Ditch, on the W.

  Evidently not done for many
years.  Contained up to 4ft of

tree branches and occasional old
bottles and the like.
  Roots of willow trees hang in
big tufts from revertment.
  Slight flow established.

  Honeydew already appear-
ing in leaves of Tilia vul-
garis.

years (at c. 30 ft up).  Wet
wood to within c. 3 in. of cam-
bium, cracks slight to none.
Dutch elm Disease marks gray-
ish and rather faint but
numerous in 1970, 1, 2 rings.
Moderate in 1933, 4, 5.  Probably
no other infections (as seen in a
section of upper trunk) but
wetwood very dark.
[16246-16247]

June 4.
Elm Disease.
None noticeabe as far N. as
Croxton.
Weald & Winteringham Green
End St Neots.  About 20%
of elms infected, 15% se-
verely.  Branch-by-branch
attack, single trees rather 
than groups.  Elms extremely
numerous, mixture od species
including procera.  Few trees
stone-dead. Vigorous regrowth
including epicormics from the
lower trunk of otherwise
dead trees.
Diddington: about 60% of
elms attacked, abundant re-
growth from partly affected
trees.
6247
Buckden. about 20% attack.
Alconbury < 1%.
Stilton slight, uncertain.
Haddon turn on the A1: several
dead & damaged elms in a 
roadside belt.
