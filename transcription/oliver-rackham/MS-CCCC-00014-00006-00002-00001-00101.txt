Trifolium
ochroleucon occurs in several
places by the roadside between
Holbein's Farm and the top of
Croydon Hill.
Rhinanthus occurs in a
big patch on the E. side of
this road halfway between
Croydon Hill Farm and Hol-
bein's Farm.
Several plants of Cirsium
eriophorum occur in this
locality a few yards away
(NGS, apart from last year's
record near Croydon Wilds).

Quy Fen (McBurneys).
Chalk grassland on N.E.

presumably to a rise in
water level.  This bears a
normal rosette at the top.
The geology of the fen
can be followed on the
ground.  The peat strip (an
old course of the Little
Wilbraham River) is an
obvious band of wet peat
with a few willow trees.
The first river terrace just
comes onto the common;
the second can be seen as
a slight rise in the ground
in the next field.
The memorial to William
Ison, blasted by lightning
on the fen in 1873, is of
oolite.  It has small gray
crustose thalli to 1[SYMBOL] in. diam.,

Rosa arvensis occurs
abundantly in Hayley
Lane.  A few plants were
seen inside the wood,

8077

for instance in the 1965 plot.
It flowers about 10 days
later than the other spp.  It
is abundant in hedges in
the Bourn district.
Callitriche stagnalis "var.
serpyllifolia" was found
on drying mud on the
N.W. main ride.
Heavy rain has caused
the surface water to increase
appreciably.

A rabbit was seen on
the College playing-field at
dusk.

Dry-rot has been found
in the floor of the College
lecture-room, I6.  The floor

[8078-8079]
8078

is double-framed and the
attack is on the ends of
the common joists where
built into the wall on an
embedded wooden plate on
the Trumpington Street side.
The opposite (E) side is
also affected, although on
an interior wall; some of
the joists are decayed, and
one of the two main
binders has been attacked
where it supports the front
of the masonry hearth
projection.  The other binder,
which spans the middle
of the room, and the ceiling
joists, are unaffected.
Dry rot also occurs in the
floor of the Parker Library,

8079

where it has attacked the
wooden plates embedded
in the walls to carry the
ends of the common joists,
but has been detected without
further damage.
June 22.
The following is reported
about Chrysanthemum segetum
at Hopton and transplanted
to Norwich.  In the cornfield
they are considerably more
advanced than those self-
-sown in the garden.  In
the field they are simple, but
in the garden much branched
and bushy. This year they
are much less abundant in
the fields than last year.

The lateral umbels of
Heracleum mantegazzianum
go on growing when the
terminal umbel has done
flowering, and eventually
reach nearly the same size.
June 24.
A rabbit was seen about
7 p.m. quitely eating grass
just beyond the Himalayan
cedar in Leckhampton.
June 25.
Most of the long grass
in Leckhampton has been cut
in the past few days.
June 26.
Another rabbot was seen
in Leckhampton: about 9.30 on
a Sunday morning eating
grass near the Henry Moore

8081

statue.
Kingston Wood (Joan Wilson)
The main wood and
its southern outlier were
visited.
The most obvious
differences from Hayley are:
1. Fewer but larger oaks.
Stumps are few and very
decayed, suggesting that the
last felling was c. 1900.
2. Much less ash. No
standards.  Old stools occur
but are rather local.
3. A much smaller wet area.
Poplars are very local.
Mercury is dominant on
the ground over almost
the whole wood.
4.  Coppicing much more recent.

Western Clearing
In a MB area.
Abundant seedlings:
Picris echi.
Hypericum hirs.
Cirsium arv.
Atriplex
Sonchus [!!!!]asper[!!!!] oleraceus
Bryonia
[????]Cizzium velagure[????]
This is in Compartment II.
The hazel and some maple
stools have been uprooted,
leaving the standard oaks
and maples and big stool
ashes.  There is much bare
ground (not severely puddled)
being colonized by many
seedlings.  The mercury has
been severly damaged but

KINGSTON WOOD Southern part 8085
[DIAG]

is returning.

[8086-8087]
8086
[DIAG]
8087

Much of the wood seems
to have been cut in the past
10 years, but none more recently
than 6 years.

Section 1.  Coppice in good con-
dition, about 10 years old,
mainly hazel but with some
coppice hawthorn (which
grows up with the habit of
hazel but rather smaller).
There is one enormous
tree of Salix cinerea, some
30 ft high.
As seen from the clearing
on the E. side, the coppice
canopy is very uniform
and flat-topped.  There
are oak standards in small
numbers but no ash, nor

[8088-8089]
8088

maple.

Section 2. Similar, but varying
in quality and somewhat
older.
The beck, ("New Ditch"
at the bottom of the wood
runs in a small ravine
like those in Eversden Wood
but larger, about [!!!!]6f[!!!!] 8 ft wide
and 4 ft deep.  It is overhung
with big hawthorns and other
bushes.
Roses are abundant at
the margins of the wood, but
scarce inside it.  Not R.
arvensis.

Section 3.  Hazel about 12
years old, of excellent

8089

quality.  Standards few.
At the N.E. corner is
a disturbed area with ash
trees, nettles, and tall
herbs including Carex disticha.
The belt along the E.
side is of conifers (Douglas,
spruce, larch, &c.) and ash,
in good condition.  There
are a few larches some
50 ft high a short distance
in from the E. side.
Mercury maintains a
closed and almost pure
canopy under the densest
shade.
This N. part of the
wood is on a good crumbly
soil and quite dry.


[8090-8091]
8090

Section 4. Probably a recent
addition to the wood. A
small plantation of widely-
-spaced poplars on tall
marsh vegetation.
Section 5. Old neglected cop-
pice, mainly hazel, stools
weak.

Section 6. Felled and replanted
with ash and mixed conifers.
This is a very dense
stand about 6ft high, the
new planting being mixed
with oak, maple, and hazel
from the old stumps.  Ground
vegetation formerly mercury,
which still persists as
an understorey though
reduced in vigour.  The upper

8091

herb layer is very tall,
dominated by dense Epitobium
hirsutum and Chamaenerion.
The main ride between
6 and 7 ends in a dense
growth of nettles at the
bottom of a slope.

Section 7. 
The northern part is old
neglected coppice (including
some ash) under oak.
The southern part is
an elm area.  The elms
are co-dominant with ash,
to the exclusion of oak,
but there is no tendency
for the elms to shade out
the ash nor to form a
dense stand; the situation

[8092-8093]
8092

recalls Buff Wood rather than
Hayley.  Both ash and elm
appear to be an even-
-aged stand resulting
from old coppice.  There is
no other coppice.  The elm
is U. carpinifolia, with rather
spreading branches in the
crown, not suckering very
freely.

Section 8.  The S. part of this
section is old hazel, ash,
and maple coppice resem-
bling Hayley Wood.  There
are two elm areas, one
derived from that in Sec-
tion 7, the other perhaps
from a row of big elms
at the edge of the wood.

8093

The N. part is hazel
coppice recently cut, about
6 years old, but regenera-
ting rather patchily.
In the N.W. corner is a
small clearing planted with
mixed conifers and containing
Calamagrostis epigeios.

Sections 9 and 10. Resembling
Hayley.  Very old coppice, pre-
dominantly ash, maple, and
hawthorn rather than hazel.
Some big ash stools in the
N. part.  The ride between
them is disused.

Section 11. Hazel coppice, rather
old but nevertheless cut.
Little ash.

[8094-8095]
8094

Section 12. Old neglected coppice,
with much ash.

Section 13. Old neglected hazel-
-maple coppice, with some
big ash stools, especially
in the S. where one excep-
tionally large one was
seen near the ditch.
S. of the ditch, the
wood is scruffy and much
disturbed, with privet (other-
wise scarce in the wood).

Section 14. The middle and
E. parts seem to be old
rather thin coppice under
standards, much as in the
N. section of Hayley.  The
W. is lined with a belt

8095

of mixed conifers (planted on
a very wide double-ditched
ride).  Adjoining the belt
is a strip of dense black-
thorn scrub, behind which
is a belt (apparently natural)
in which poplar is dominant.
No Carex riparia was
found here (or anywhere in
the wood) despite a search;
although this is the wettest
part of the wood, there is
no sign of any surface water
and the shade is dense.

Section 15. Like the E. of
Section 14.

Sections 16 and 17. Old and
rather dark coppice containing

[8096-8097]
8096

much hawthorn.

Near the W. corner of Section
9 was found some presumptive
sun-scald of mercury leaves.
Affected leaves turn
straw-coloured in a very
narrow strip around the
margin (including any
holes in the leaf).  All
leaves on the plant are
equally affected.  No sign
of any pathogen.  The site
is about 20 yards in from
the edge of the wood, with
fairly light shade, and the
affected area could be
reached by sunlight coming
under the canopy about
4 p.m.

8097

Rides. Mostly narrow but
not arched over.  Some of
the conifer plantings appear
to be on old very wide
rides.  Ride 9-10 is dis-
used and overgrown.  The
ride 10-11 and 1-15 is
new, used to communicate
between Kingston Manor and
Edgehill Farm.
Most of the rides are
ditched, with a shallow
ditch on one side only.
Characteristic ride plants:
Oxlip.  On all rides through-
out the mercury area.
Meadowsweet. On the less-used
rides; perhaps injured by treading
and cutting.
Fragaria.

[8098-8099]
8098

Creeping Jenny.  On several
rides in the N. part.
Cynosurus       [SYMBOL] On a puddled
Juncus bufonius [SYMBOL] ride (3-5).

Cornus is scarce.
Rubus caesius is local.
The typical under-storey to
recent coppice is excellent
very uniform mercury.
Bluebells are very local.
Hawthorn consists of
the two species in about
equal proporations, with abun-
dant hybrids.

Polyporus squamosus.  Occasional
on ash.

Lodging of barley is

8099

quite severe after recent high
winds and rain.  Around
Edgehill Farm, it is con-
spicuously more severe in
the furrows of old ridge &
furrow.
June 27.
Letters receeived from GHR re
Chrysanthemum segetum.
Two plants [!!!!]planted[!!!!] from seed at
Norwich in full sun have a
much-branched bushy habit
with 15-20 heads.  Those
transplanted in previous years
remained simple or little
branched.
Those growing in a barley
field at Hopton (barley 12-15 in.
high now, [!!!!])[!!!!] just coming into
flower) are simple with one
