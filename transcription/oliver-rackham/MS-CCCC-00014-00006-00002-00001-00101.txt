Trifolium
ochroleucon occurs in several
places by the roadside between
Holbein's Farm and the top of
Croydon Hill.
Rhinanthus occurs in a
big patch on the E. side of
this road halfway between
Croydon Hill Farm and Hol-
bein's Farm.
Several plants of Cirsium
eriophorum occur in this
locality a few yards away
(NGS, apart from last year's
record near Croydon Wilds).

Quy Fen (McBurneys).
Chalk grassland on N.E.
side of the big pit. On
spoil from the pit (mainly

[8070-8071]

chalk marl with some river
gravel). Among hawthorn
bushes, which show no
sign of further encroachment.

Cirsium arvense has
abundant seedlings on the
mud.  Some of the older
[DIAG]
plants have a leafless
stem 1 ft long, with only
2-3 internodes, corresponding

289: the same.

Very abundant in grass-
land A; generally the most
abundant foliose Cladonia
on Lakenheath & Fox-hole.
291: as 289.
292: C.arbuscula, ibid.
Less abundant than C. im-
pexa; not in grassland A.

294: C. tenuis, ibid.

presumably to a rise in
water level.  This bears a
normal rosette at the top.
The geology of the fen
can be followed on the
ground.  The peat strip (an
old course of the Little
Wilbraham River) is an
obvious band of wet peat
with a few willow trees.
The first river terrace just
comes onto the common;
the second can be seen as
a slight rise in the ground
in the next field.
The memorial to William
Ison, blasted by lightning
on the fen in 1873, is of
oolite.  It has small gray
crustose thalli to 1[SYMBOL] in. diam.,

[8076-8077]

and a minute Candelariella.
Six hares were seen on
the disused Mildenhall railway
between Quy Fen Drove (Fran-
cis station) and Honey Hill.
The McBurneys have a
young tawny-owl.  It eats
dead mice, and meat mixed
with fur.
June 20.
One of the Eccremocarpos
plants from Cambridge
market is developing a
small infl.

Rosa arvensis occurs
abundantly in Hayley
Lane.  A few plants were

Hayley Wood (changing charts).
Rosa arvensis occurs
abundantly in Hayley
Lane.  A few plants were
seen inside the wood,

8077

for instance in the 1965 plot.
It flowers about 10 days
later than the other spp.  It
is abundant in hedges in
the Bourn district.
Callitriche stagnalis "var.
serpyllifolia" was found
on drying mud on the
N.W. main ride.
Heavy rain has caused
the surface water to increase
appreciably.

A rabbit was seen on
the College playing-field at
dusk.

Dry-rot has been found
in the floor of the College
lecture-room, I6.  The floor

[8078-8079]

is double-framed and the
attack is on the ends of
the common joists where
built into the wall on an
embedded wooden plate on
the Trumpington Street side.
The opposite (E) side is
also affected, although on
an interior wall; some of
the joists are decayed, and
one of the two main
binders has been attacked
where it supports the front
of the masonry hearth
projection.  The other binder,
which spans the middle
of the room, and the ceiling
joists, are unaffected.
Dry rot also occurs in the
floor of the Parker Library,

8079

where it has attacked the
wooden plates embedded
in the walls to carry the
ends of the common joists,
but has been detected without
further damage.
June 22.
The following is reported
about Chrysanthemum segetum
at Hopton and transplanted
to Norwich.  In the cornfield
they are considerably more
advanced than those self-
-sown in the garden.  In
the field they are simple, but
in the garden much branched
and bushy. This year they
are much less abundant in
the fields than last year.
June 23.

The lateral umbels of
Heracleum mantegazzianum
go on growing when the
terminal umbel has done
flowering, and eventually
reach nearly the same size.
June 24.
A rabbit was seen about
7 p.m. quitely eating grass
just beyond the Himalayan
cedar in Leckhampton.
June 25.
Most of the long grass
in Leckhampton has been cut
in the past few days.
June 26.
Another rabbot was seen
in Leckhampton: about 9.30 on
a Sunday morning eating
grass near the Henry Moore

8081

statue.
Kingston Wood (Joan Wilson)
The main wood and
its southern outlier were
visited.
The most obvious
differences from Hayley are:
1. Fewer but larger oaks.
Stumps are few and very
decayed, suggesting that the
last felling was c. 1900.
2. Much less ash. No
standards.  Old stools occur
but are rather local.
3. A much smaller wet area.
Poplars are very local.
Mercury is dominant on
the ground over almost
the whole wood.
4.  Coppicing much more recent.

Western Clearing
In a MB area.
Abundant seedlings:
Picris echi.
Hypericum hirs.
Cirsium arv.
Atriplex
Sonchus [!!!!]asper[!!!!] oleraceus
Bryonia
[????]Cizzium velagure[????]
This is in Compartment II.
The hazel and some maple
stools have been uprooted,
leaving the standard oaks
and maples and big stool
ashes.  There is much bare
ground (not severely puddled)
being colonized by many
seedlings.  The mercury has
been severly damaged but

is returning.

Much of the wood seems
to have been cut in the past
10 years, but none more recently
than 6 years.
