Procedure: pace in a S.W.
direction along Main Ride from
the 1966-7 [????] coppice junction.
Record the location of each
Carex patch, and the species
if fruiting. The only fruiting
species present are acuti-
formis and riparia. Sterile
plants are recorded as such
and not determined. Each
patch, or part of a patch, is
cursorily looked at and the
widest leaf measured in 16ths
of an inch. The two sides of
Main Ride are recorded separately,
as are the populations in 3rd N.
Ride and the 1968 coppice.
Plants evidently take about
a year's exposure to flower.

A most complex wood,
which could not be investigated
in detail.
The three parcels along
Bury Lane, A, B, E, have a
remarkable structure of aspen
poles over small hazel coppice
stools, not known elsewhere.
Presumably secondary (tho partly
pre- 1837).
Parcel C appears to be

[12438-12439]
2438
old secondary woodland,
which its earthworks confirm.
D is probably the original
wood. What little was
seen of it suggests typical
ancient "heavy" woodland.

Half Grove, Stanton.
F is a [!!!!]post[!!!!]pre- 1837 secon-
dary wood.
G has hazel coppice and 
medium-sized ash stools.
Status uncertain. Could be
primary. Transition to light
woodland (bracken is abun-
dant around Alecock's Gra[????]
a short distance W.).

Small coppice hazel

Oak: one coppice stool.
Stool at ground level, 83"

One seedling oak.

Large areas of [????] with
no ash. Little ground veg.
occ. bracken & Oxalis, little
mercury. Oak-birch (mainly

2441
pubescens) - hazel wood.
Very sharp boundary to the
ordinary boulder - clay with
mercury - primrose.
Ivy near edge

Very little maple at all

Hawthorn mainly mono but
oxy. present.

Elm at NE corner carpinif.
spreading as poles from original
ruinous tree.

1. Good woodland structure with
many unevenaged standards.
2. [!!!!]Ex[!!!!] Light and heavy types both
present, with excellent sharp

[12442-12443]
2442
transition: oak-ash (maple)
-hazel - MP vs oak-birch
-hazel-(Pt)Oxalis.
3. Ancient woodland plants:
Cr. oxy., Milium, Melica.
4. Good boundary bank.

This appears to be a 
primary woodland.* Despite
much encroachment by
bungalows &c. the eastern
side is still relatively undis-
turbed, though neglected, and 
provides a good transition
between the dry variants of
light and heavy boulder-clay
woodland.
* Relatively small ash stools,
possibly due to transition to 
light woodland type.

2443
Hinderclay Wood.
A large wood with straight
S. and W. sides. It looks like
and intact 3-layered wood but
the interior may have been planted 
with poplars.

Crickets were heard after 
dark in grass or a sugar
beet field by Grundle House.
A soft and tinkly drilling
noise going on for about 2 sec.
at a time.

Facon's Hall, Rikinghall Su-
perior, is a large moated farm

gular hedge enclosing perhaps 50
acres.

Liberty Boundary, Walsham le
Willows and Westhorpe (048-
709).
Marked by a belt of scrub
on rather shallow earthworks 
alongside the road.
Hedge of about 6 woody
species including Crat. oxy. There

2445
is some mercury but no other
ancient woodland plants were
seen.
Mulley's Grove, Ash Grove,

almost unaltered.
