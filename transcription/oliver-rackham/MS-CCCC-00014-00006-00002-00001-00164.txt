about Sept. 1.
Main Glade: 2 widths

wheat. They have a large de-
tachable sticky aril. [DIAG] [SYMBOL].

Procedure: pace in a S.W.
direction along Main Ride from
the 1966-7 [????] coppice junction.
Record the location of each
Carex patch, and the species
if fruiting. The only fruiting
species present are acuti-
formis and riparia. Sterile
plants are recorded as such
and not determined. Each
patch, or part of a patch, is
cursorily looked at and the
widest leaf measured in 16ths
of an inch. The two sides of
Main Ride are recorded separately,
as are the populations in 3rd N.
Ride and the 1968 coppice.
Plants evidently take about
a year's exposure to flower.
