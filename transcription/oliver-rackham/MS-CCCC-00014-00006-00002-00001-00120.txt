[SYMBOL]22 June 1967
Hayley Wood
perambulation cont.
Mr. Horsford's clearance
along the E. side of Hayley
Wood involves cutting all
the trees and bushes in
the whole width of the
Lane, except for a row
of trees about 10 yards
apart along the E. side 
of the Lane. A strip of
woodland is left intact
between the Lane and the
Bishop's Dyke. The bushes
around the S.E, pond are
not felled. Bush cover is
still fairly good on the E.
side of the wood, although
there are some gaps.
Sanguisorba flourishes

[9130-9131]
9130
on the E. side of the Wood
although quite close to this 
operation.
The Melampyrum hedge
contains 4 plants of Mel-
ampyrum cristatum and
2 flourishing plants of Gen-
ista tinctoria. The tall grass
could do with cutting.
The colony of Sedum Te-
lephium in the 1965 plot
contains some 40 shoots,
to 14 in. high, all apparently
blind. Taste like lettuce.
Coltsfoot occurs on the 
1965 bonfire sites.
Oxlip leaves are rapidly
dying. One infl. was found
in the Glade.
The regrowth of ash in

9131
the 1966 plot is appreciably
better on stolls which have 
been protected against deer
by thorns. Some of the
unprotected stools have 
gone away none the less,
the performance being
somewhat better than in
previous years.
June 23.
A Dipsacus grown in the
Leckhampton loke.
June 24.
THree privets have died
in the garden at Norwich: two
on the Nunns' side of the gate
and one adjacent to it on the 
road side. They appear to
have died suddenly soon
after starting growth.

Excursion with the Norfolk
Research Committee
Several good fossils were
seen in the Caistor chalk pit:
particularly belemnites (with
a cavatiy which enlarges and
becomes thin-walled at the
big end). A large sea-urchin
was found with a flint com-
pletely filling it and forming
a big nodule coming out of
the bottom end.
Mill Common Shotesham
(218981) is a tract of rough
grassland on a gentle S.
facing slope. It has thorn
thickets and scattered large
thorn bushes, but there is
little tendency for the thorns
to invade.

9133
The glassland of Bixley
extinct village is not of
much interest: overgrazed
and with isolated groups
of Cirsium arvense
A pond in the earthworks
(a later insertion) has spar-
ganium ramosum, Potamo-
geton crispus, and P. berch-
toldii.
Heracleum mantegazzianum
occurs as small plants in
caistor chalk-pit, and well
developed on the verges of
the Bungay road.
The derelict and ruinous
15th cent. farm, Shotesham
Greatwood Farm, is built
of oak with wattle & daub
panels. The walls slope slight-

[9134-9135]
9134
ly inwards and hence are very
damp. Oak and hazel are both
badly consumed by death-watch.
25 June.
Thunder flies are rather
a nuisance.
A fine Verbascum at Coton
has a pulverulentum habit
with a complex inflorescence
up to 11ft high, flowers open-
ing in a complex sequence, green
leaves, flowers like nigrum and
with purple filaments. It has 
been there for many years.
26 June.
Between Ostend and Bruges,
is a large silt plain, quite
flat but apparently well above
sea level, mainly pastoral but
well wooded.

27 June.
On the S. side of the
Chiemsee and by the Grosse
Ache are several peat
bogs with birch scrub, some
with active peat cuttings.
Pinus Cembra was seen
only once on the whole
crossing of the E. Alps, a
few trees on crags at
the N. end of the Tauern
Tunnel. It does not occur
in large numbers on the E. side of Gastein.
The vegetation of the
Drau-Möll valley appears
completely recovered from
the floods, except for a
few fields which were
deeply covered in gravel.
The valley between

[9136-9137]
9136
Jesenice and Ljublijana
has a great variety of
trees along the river,
spruce predominating. Tilia
and Ostrya frequent. Little
Abies. Some oak (tendency
to Q. pubescens_. On S.
facing rock outcrops
is Pinus sylvestris woodland
with Erica carnea and
Melica ciliata. Alnus in-
cana by the river (A. gluti-
nosa occasional near Dim-
žale).
Epiphyric bryophytes
are not very luxuriant
on trees in the Ljubljana
area, though Leucodon
occurs on avenues at 
Domžale.

9137
Fire-flies are exceedingly
numerous and spectacular
at Domžale. They were
seen about an hour after
sundown in cornfields.
They were not uniformly
distributed, being most nu-
merous in one corner of
a barley field. They have 
a very bright golden-
-yelloe light which some-
times shines continuously
when the insect is resting 
but usually flashes rapidly
on and off when it is
flying. They dash around
in a somewhat aimless
way. They can fly up to
10ft above the ground,
but are most numerous

[9138-9139]
9138
in and just above the
crop. The light comes from
four sources on two of
the hind segments of
the abdomen. They were
also seen, thought less
commonly, in short grass
around the house.
A fine Catalpa is among
trees planted at Domžale,
around the Institute.
Lilium bulbifernum is
abundant at the edges
of woods and by the railway
line in the valley of the sava
dolinka.
Nematis flammula is
abundant in Pinus sylvestris
woods in the Sava dolinka
valley.

28 June.
The Logaška Planota S.W. of
Ljublijana is an area of
rolling limestone hills with
countless small dolines
up to 100 yards across.
The forests are mainly spruce
but mixed with oak, beech, &c.
The dolines have a rich
limestone flora on the 
grassy sides: the flat
bottom has a silt-like
soild and is sometimes 
cultivated.
Pinus nigra is frequent
in the hills between Vrhnika
and Ilirska Bistrica, sometimes
forming pure woods on S.
aspects.
The polje between

[9140-9141]
9140
Logatec and Planine is a
flat-bottomed plain of
hay-meadows and unculti-
vated fen, with a few low
wooded hills, It has a
sluggish river but has no
outlet. The Pirka polje is
similar but cultivated.
S. of Ilirska Bistrica is 
an area of more conventional
hill country Quercus pubes-
cens extends N. about as
far as Postojna, but most
submediterranean species
do not extend N. of the
Croatian border, and few
true Mediterranean plants
were seen on the mainland
at all.

9141
Around Rupa N. of 
Rijeka is a large tract of
low limestone jills and
dolines. Vegetation is
maquis and low woodland.
interspersed with glassland
patches. Prominent spp:
Quercus pubescens
Robinia
Acer monspessulanum
Ostrya
Fraxinus Ornus
Kohlhauschia
Buphthalmum
Tilia cordata: introduced?

Vineyards begin about
10 miles N. of Rijeka.
Melica ciliata occurs in 
limestone cuttings in the N.

[9142-9143]

outskirts of Rijeka.
Cotinus Coggygria
occurs in the suburbs of
Rijeka.
Cletis Australis is
planted as a street tree
in Rijeka.
Pinus maritima is
occasional in the suburbs of
Rijeka.
SPartium occurs just
above the docks at Rijeka.
Beech is very much
