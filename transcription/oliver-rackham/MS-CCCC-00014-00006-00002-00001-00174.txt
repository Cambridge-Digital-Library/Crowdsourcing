  The rides in the wood
have a very poor flora, ap-
parently because of re-sowing.
  The whole wood is very
dry apart from the pond
and ditches in the S.W. which
have some 2 ft of water.
These do not conform to the
main ride but extend as
wet hollows across it.  Small
areas of water elsewhere in
the Fakenham Ride ditches.
  Large oaks are frequent 
throughout the wood.
