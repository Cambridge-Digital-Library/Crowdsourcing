  The rides in the wood
have a very poor flora, ap-
parently because of re-sowing.
  The whole wood is very
dry apart from the pond
and ditches in the S.W. which
have some 2 ft of water.
These do not conform to the
main ride but extend as
wet hollows across it.  Small

  The E. boundary degenerates
from a strong and sinuous
bank just N. of the corner E.
of the pond to a straight
and totally unbanked boun-
dary (simple ditch) at the
junction with the Great Wood.
This transition appears to
be gradual.


[13114-13115]
31214
    Fakenham Great Wood.
  Three main woodland types:
(i) Dry calcareous with ash,
maple, hornbeam as well as
oaks and hazel.  Mercury ground
dominant.  The richest type,
in species, especially of woody
plants.  Probably not more than
1/8 of the wood.  Remains of
a 3-layered structure.
(ii)  Dry acid.  Oak and hazel
with occasional birch and poplar.
Sycamore and beech rare.
Ground vegetation mainly
woodland brambles (not caesius).
Anemone rare.  Occasional wet
areas without much difference
in species.  Originally 2-layered.
Many big oak standards.
3115
Much the largest thype in ex-
tent, floristically poor.
(iii) Dry acid with bracken.
Much affected by felling and
planting, but apparently a
"hesth" woodland with scattered
oaks, much birch, and no
regular coppice.  Possibly two
generations of oak, one around
1810 and one around 1870.
Daffodils apparently confined
tp this type, locally very abun-
dant. Has more of the rarer
trees & shrubs than (ii).
  No evidence was seen on
the relation between (ii) and
(iii). A trench dug near the
Heath Cottages showed sand
overlying chalky boulder clay

[13116-13117]
3116
which may explain the re
lation between (ii) and (iii).

For its size, this is flor-
istically poorer than any of
the great East Anglian woods
save North Elmham.  It in-
cludes most of the rarer
trees but usually in very
small numbers.
  The soil is slightly pod-
solized in much of the (ii)
and (iii) areas.  No deep accu-
mulations of litter (cf Bradfield).
Wood-bank very uniform
and well-preserved, save in the
N. half of the E. side.
  Within area (ii) meercury
and primroses regularly occur
3117
along the edges of ditches.
Occasional waterlogging could
be important in excluding
merury and bracken.
  The earthworks in the
W. sectioon consist of a 
4-armed pond about 3 ft
deep, two other ponds, and
some shallow unbanked ditches,
one of which appears to be
shown on the 2 1/2" map.  They
are evdently earlier than
Fakenham Broad Ride.
  Oak standards in the
wood sometimes exceed 4 ft
dia. and 60 ft high.  Well
grown, though rather widely
spaced (c. 15 to the acre), now
over-mature.

[13118-13119]
3118
  The two great beeches
by the cross-roads are each
c. 3 ft dia. and 70 ft high.  No
dating features. Presumed to
be planted.
  No evidence on the original
vegetation od the central planted
area.
  Sycamowe infiltration is
still local.  Few standard trees,
numerous saplings.
  One horse-chestnut sapling seen by
Fakenham Broad Ride.
  Note that New Ride (on 1st ed.
O.S.) is not ditched, thus probably
later than the other main Rides.
  The N.W. compartment is
full of deep dry holes, pre-
sumably very old sand and
3119
gravel pits, especially in the
"heath" area.
  The green lane along the
E. of the wood is a very fine 
one, remarkable for its range
of trees & shrubs.
  Woodhouse has completely
disappeared and the site is
plowed.  In the adjoining
wood there is a small elm
area with nettles and the 
stumps of a few very large
trees.
  The earthworks in the
S.E. part of the wood are
certainly artificial, probably drain-
age ditches, except for the 
curious apparently asymmetrical
bank.

[13120-13121
3120
Notable features.
1. Size.
2. Fine and complete boundary
earthwork, on shape recalling
a medieval park
3. Oak standards perhaps un-
surpassed in any Boulder-clay
wood. (Woodland structure
otherwise poor).
4. No signsa of secondsry
woodland (w=excewpt sand pits,
which may indicste former
heath).
5. Longish list of trees & shrubs:
   Oak              Horse-chestnut
   Ash              Dogwood
   Elm              Betula pubesc.
   Beech*           Rhamnus[SYMBOL]

  Betula verruc.
  Malus sylv.
  Ulmus glabra

  6. Some trees particularly rare
  or absent: ash, all willows.
  7. Good series of acid and
  calcareous dry woodland, n-
  cluding one of the largest
  
  [SYMBOL] Rare in woods of this type.
  [SYMBOL] Old record not seen today.

dry acid breamble type.*
8. Hornvbewam occurs as pol-
lards, large, and small coplpice:
comparable situation only at
Buff Wood.
9. Daffodils
10. Vinca minor, perhaps intro-
duced.
11.Hop in woodland.
12. No bluebells.  Anemone rare
13. Rides largely devoid of interest
probably because of re-seeding.
14. Phosphatic plants rare.
15. Apparently no oxlip.
Note that there are appar-
ently no boundary pollards.
 *Mainly 2-layered oak-hazel with
only scattered birch.
3123
Sheep hurdles.
  A few in use in the fields
N. of the N.E. part of the
wood.  Made apparently of
sallow poles, all of which
except the three uprights & two braces are
paired split halves, both
halves of each pole being
used in rhe hurdle.  The
two ends are halves of
slightly thicker poles, with
drilled mortices for
the rails.  The
spacing of the top      [DIAG]
2 poles is 6 in.
and of the bottom 2
4 in., the others being 5 in.
The braces and middle up-
right are riven from larger

[13124-13125]
3124
timber and nailed on with
rose nails. Hurdles are joined
together by a rectangular
ring welded from thin
iron rod and permanently
fixed round one upright.
3125
Wellmere Grove.
Three main woodland types:
(i) Dry calcareous with ash,
maple, oak, hazel.  Mercury
ground dominant, but patchy.
Differs from the corresponding
type in Fakenham in that ash
is dominant in the LC, with
moderately large stools.  Much
better-developed 3-layered
structure.  This covers most
of the S. and middle of the
wood, but not the southernmost
compartment or S.E. handle.
(ii) Dry acid. Exactly as in
Fakenham.  Mainly in the  N.
of the wood, but boundary
irregular and patches delsewhere.
(iii) Dry calcareous without 3-

[13126-13127]
3126
-layered structure, but including
ash as once-cuts.  Appears
to be secondsary.  Prunus avium
characgteristic.  S. compartment
and S.E. handle.
  Similar floristically to the
Grest Wood.
  Earthworks are very complex
and puzzling.
A appears to
be an old
lane boundary
[!!!!younger than] older than or
coeval with
B-G which    [DIAG]
abut upon
it and
in the
case of G
3127
cause an alteration in it.  H
is perhaps the original N  end
of the wood and I a later
continuation of it.  J is cut
across B and undoubtedly
younger  (its course is
determinbed for a
few feet by  [DIAG]
the presence lof
B) but wobbles.
It is probably a drainage
ditch cut through woodland
and determined by the need to
avoid particular trees.  J
seems to be continued by K
although K now has a well-
-defined wood-bank.  L is
not a continuation of K but 
conforms to a field boundary

[13128-13129]
3128
(with old pollards) to the S.
Suggested sequence:
[SYMBOL] Wood   [DIAG]
occupies 
compartments
I and 
an unspe-
cified area
further E.,
contained
by a 
wood
bank.
This is either
primnary and divided into
parcels fo several ownership,
or (more likely) secondary
incorporating a previous field
system.
3129

further course being E. of

of wood to the E. of it.
[SYMBOL] Addition of compartments II

[13130-13131]
3130
and III, the former perhaps
by abandonment, the latter
almost certainly by encroach-
ment.
  The joining of this wood to
Fakenham, and the N. contin-
uation of the lane are not
definitely assignable to any of
these periods.

Prunus occurs chiefly in
the S.E. handle but is scattered
elsewhere.  The three great stan-
dards rival those at Hindlesham.
Rugged bsrk. Tops decayed,
and in one case the whole
trnk rotten, but the trees
still viogorous and the flowers
abundant and conspicuous

3131
from the road to the S.
Note the marginal elms,
here not explained by any
building yet forming a definite
row.

Notable features.
1. Earthworks of remarkable
complexity, interpretation very
uncersin but undoubtedly
involving woodland of at least
3 types of history though all
earlier than 1835-6 O.S.
2.  List of trees & shrubs:
Oak      Hazel
Ash      Prunus spin.
Elm             avkum
Dogwood  Betula pubesc.
Rhamnus  Malus sylv.

[13132-13133]
2132
Ulmus carpin.  Aspen
Maple

3. Willow rare or absent.  Ash
abundant, in contrast to the
remarkable scarcity of this tree
in the more calcareous parts of
Fakenham.
4. Rather poor calcareous
woodland but with quite large
ash stools.
5. Cherries perhaps unsurpassed
in East Anglia.
6. Phosphatic plants rare.
7. Apparently no oxlip.
6. Bluebells absent, anemones
absent?
3123
   New Park Grove.
  Apparently an old secon-
dary wood, possibly intended
as an oak wood with chest-
nut and elm coppice.
  The slight wood bank on
the E. side, with the W. boundary
determined by Fakenham Ride,
and the absence of large
ash stools all distinguish it
from Wellmere Grove.  The wood
bank is the lesser of the two
although it is the parish boundary.
  Complex earthworks exist
in Park Grove.
  The most notable tree is
the alder, not otherwise in the 
Fakenham complex.

[13134-13135]
3134
     Sapiston Great Grove.
   Appears to be a fine wood

Abundant oxlips.  As seen
from the road it appears
to be dominated by hornbeam
LC, but has many other trees.

      Livermore.
  Fine plantations of mixed
conifers in the Park and many
outlying woods.

  At Ixworth is a windmill that
grinds stone-grund flour.  Visi-
ble for a long distsance by the
flour dust on the black wall

12 trees, all small, apparently
maidens, largest c. 10 ft high
and c. 2 in. dia.

Occurs in a tract of about
15 yards of the stream coming
from the old plantation (fed
entirely from sand areas).
In light to dense shade.  Dom-

  The grest incrase in ox-
lips is probably due to more
(and bigger) infls per plant
than to more plants, as sgown
by comparison wirh adjoining
uncut areas.  Hybrid plants are
particularly responsive.
  The primrose belt is very
narrow and well-defined.
Hybrid plants are fr=quent in
the oxlip belt near it.
  Three tilia cordata stools
were found in the S.E.
part of the zone without

Bush Ride.
  The diagram of p. 313
shows that the ditches of 
Bush Ride (here rather massive)
are intersected by the boundary
of Root's.  There is no exit
from the ride, the footpath
being diverted to the N.
This diversion is long-standing 
as shown by the huge, though
well-drained, ash stools growing
in the ride itself.  It is
probable that Bush Ride once
met the edge of the wood but
was cut ofF by the making
of Root's.  It is therefore prob-
ably medieval.
  The Allium ursinum in
this area is the first recorded
