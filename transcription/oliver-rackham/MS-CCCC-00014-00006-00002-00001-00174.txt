  The rides in the wood
have a very poor flora, ap-
parently because of re-sowing.
  The whole wood is very
dry apart from the pond
and ditches in the S.W. which
have some 2 ft of water.
These do not conform to the
main ride but extend as
wet hollows across it.  Small
areas of water elsewhere in
the Fakenham Ride ditches.
  Large oaks are frequent 
throughout the wood.

  The E. boundary degenerates
from a strong and sinuous
bank just N. of the corner E.
of the pond to a straight
and totally unbanked boun-
dary (simple ditch) at the
junction with the Great Wood.
This transition appears to
be gradual.

    Fakenham Great Wood.
  Three main woodland types:
(i) Dry calcareous with ash,
maple, hornbeam as well as
oaks and hazel.  Mercury ground
dominant.  The richest type,
in species, especially of woody
plants.  Probably not more than
1/8 of the wood.  Remains of
a 3-layered structure.
(ii)  Dry acid.  Oak and hazel
with occasional birch and poplar.
Sycamore and beech rare.
Ground vegetation mainly
woodland brambles (not caesius).
Anemone rare.  Occasional wet
areas without much difference
in species.  Originally 2-layered.
Many big oak standards.
3115
Much the largest thype in ex-
tent, floristically poor.
(iii) Dry acid with bracken.
Much affected by felling and
planting, but apparently a
"hesth" woodland with scattered
oaks, much birch, and no
regular coppice.  Possibly two
generations of oak, one around
1810 and one around 1870.
Daffodils apparently confined
tp this type, locally very abun-
dant. Has more of the rarer
trees & shrubs than (ii).
  No evidence was seen on
the relation between (ii) and
(iii). A trench dug near the
Heath Cottages showed sand
overlying chalky boulder clay

[13116-13117]
3116
which may explain the re
lation between (ii) and (iii).

For its size, this is flor-
istically poorer than any of
the great East Anglian woods
save North Elmham.  It in-
cludes most of the rarer
trees but usually in very
small numbers.
  The soil is slightly pod-
solized in much of the (ii)
and (iii) areas.  No deep accu-
mulations of litter (cf Bradfield).
Wood-bank very uniform
and well-preserved, save in the
N. half of the E. side.
  Within area (ii) meercury
and primroses regularly occur
3117
along the edges of ditches.
Occasional waterlogging could
be important in excluding
merury and bracken.
  The earthworks in the
W. sectioon consist of a 
4-armed pond about 3 ft
deep, two other ponds, and
some shallow unbanked ditches,
one of which appears to be
shown on the 2 1/2" map.  They
are evdently earlier than
Fakenham Broad Ride.
  Oak standards in the
wood sometimes exceed 4 ft
dia. and 60 ft high.  Well
grown, though rather widely
spaced (c. 15 to the acre), now
over-mature.
