Viaduct. Massive arches of

bridge and an asphalt water-
proofing layer. The next arch has
shifted several inches more
recently, cracking in the classic
hinge process. Partly broken
down by an immense poplar

falling on it.
Vegetation mainly ivy - nothing
visible of the ancient woodland
plants said to occur here.
Tide The river Ouse, though
much silted up, is still very
tidal. Part of the site, at a low
level, is used as a washland
with a hatch letting water in.
Railway land itself has recently 
been made into another washland,
with a hatch at a higher level.

Downs. A great deal of the 
steep chalk slopes east of Lewes
is young ashwood.
