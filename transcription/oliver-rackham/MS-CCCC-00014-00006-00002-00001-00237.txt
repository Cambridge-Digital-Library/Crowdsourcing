TORTWORTH CHESTNUT
[DIAG]
Has a great central trunk, much
decayed, about 3/4 of whose cir-
cumference bears bark.  Four live
[18354-18355]
8354
limbs.  The rest of the tree
consists of five limbs missing
at or near the base of the
trunk, which have sprawled 
and taken root and sent up 
further trunks.
The oldest limbs have very
stubby twigs with annual incre-
ments of an inch or less.  The
younger & middle-aged limbs
vary much in vigour.
  Surrounded by 19th-cent. railing
and an old stone wall.

Several mercury clones
Even the oldest twigs fruit.
Original trunk forked into two,
both of which still bear branches,
though the N.W. one is almost dead
save for epicormics.  The top of this
latter fell many years ago and
is still lying about.  Slightly
attaqcked by wet-rot & deathwatch.
Annual rings mostly uncountable,
but where visible run at about
6-8 per inch.

Bronze plate on enclosure:
THIS TREE SUPPOSED TO BE
Six Hundred Years Old 1st Jany
         1800.
May Man Still Guard thy Venerable form
From the Rude Blasts, and Tempestuous
storm.
[18356-18357]
8356
Still mayest thou Flourish
    through Succeeding time,
And Last, Long Last the Wonder
of the Clime.
  Original trunk very fluted
Bark reticulate. Epicormics few
but flourishing; one may gener-
ate a new limb.
  In practice surroundings, with 
oaks, chestnuts, Pinus nigra,
cedars,  &c but no trees
obviously >250 y.
 Nuts this year seem to
have been small and not good.

New trunks tend not to be very
rootfast;  several have fallen and 
in some cases have taken root again. 
Girth 30'1"
  Secondary trunks are up to
c. 2 ft across and 40 ft high.
They overtop the original trunks and
are probably responsible for its
decline. Probably up to 150 years 
old.
Remarkably little lichenized.

  Also at Tortworth is a very
fine lime tee, some 100 ft high and
3 ft dia.  Appears to be Tilia cor-
data.  [SYMBOL] 12.
  Between Wotton-under-Edge 
and Tortworth is a country of
scattered farms and lanes. At
[18358-18359]
8358
Bradley is a fine green. Lanes
are winding and of irregular width.
  At 740942 is a scheduled
ancient monument consisting of
banks in grassland of unknown
purpose.
Hedge pattern is remarkably
complex. Hedge appears to be
mostly of 6-8 species, All are
well-kept. Entiree counr=try is
permanent improved grassa. Some
recent hedge-laying but most 
hedges are mechanically cut to
a rectsngular section.  Walls are
rare in this area (common on the
Cotswold plateau ansd S. of Kings-
wood).
Several roadside  purprestures
including one near Howley, some
100 yds x 2-10 yds, both of
8359
whose hedges survive, the younger 
one (of 3-4 species) having recently
beenb cut-&-laid ([SYMBOL]).  these are
all agricultural purprestures without
houses.
  Elms relatively few in this
country. No large trees left alive;
most of the dead ones have by
now been felled (as in S.E. Gloucs
generally). Suckers have died
within 3-10 ft of dead elms,
but away from standard trees
they are alive.
Hedgerow trees comparatively 
few, mostly oaks. A few oak
and ash pollards. Few trees
freestanding in fields.
From Damery up to Trotworth
is a very steep hill. The sides
of the holloway are abundantly
[18360-18361]
8360
covered with Allium ursinum - a
characteristic plant of the district,
tgough not usually in hedges -
up to about 40 ft above the
level of the river.
  Allium is not particularly
associated with other plants of
flushes or wet sites.
  Ferns slightly more frequent
than in E. England - chiefly
Scolopendrium.
 The road past Trotworth church
is straight, between hedges of 2
species.
  The little Avon is a clear
fast river. Banks have alder -
seen nowhere else in the area -
and abundant garlic.

Tortworth Great Copse (near
8361
Charfield). Intact, apart from 
big quarry now long-disused.

Grove in Wootton Hill.
Small circular enclosure
containing about a dozen Pinus
nigra trees planted in 1887 to
replace their predecessors planted 
in 1815 by then decrepit and
consumed in the Jubilee bonfire.
In 1937 some successors to
the 1887 trees were planted, but
have been overshadowed by the
latter and have not prospered.

Stachys alpina.
  On Wootton Hall, 756943.
Reserve of Gloucs Naturalists' 
Trust.
  Small pasture between road
[18362-18363]
8362
and wood.
[DIAG]
Pasture is separated from
road by ancient hedge (c.5 spp
which is strongly sinuous.
Between pasture & wood there
[18364-18365]
8363
is no bank or a slight one.
Wood strongly resembles West-
ridge Wood: beech coppice, ash
&c.
Stachys plants are in about
a dioen groups, marked by
pegs. Each group consists of
1-4 plants each with severasl
stems.  Theyu flowered well last
year. Most are at the foot
f the roadside lynchet, some
near the edge of the wood. Total
about 40 plants.
