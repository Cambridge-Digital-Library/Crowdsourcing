TORTWORTH CHESTNUT
[DIAG]
Has a great central trunk, much
decayed, about 3/4 of whose cir-
cumference bears bark.  Four live
[18354-18355]
8354
limbs.  The rest of the tree
consists of five limbs missing
at or near the base of the
trunk, which have sprawled 
and taken root and sent up 
further trunks.
The oldest limbs have very
stubby twigs with annual incre-
ments of an inch or less.  The
younger & middle-aged limbs
vary much in vigour.
  Surrounded by 19th-cent. railing
and an old stone wall.
Inside enclosure.

8355
Several mercury clones
Even the oldest twigs fruit.
Original trunk forked into two,
both of which still bear branches,
though the N.W. one is almost dead
save for epicormics.  The top of this
latter fell many years ago and
is still lying about.  Slightly
attaqcked by wet-rot & deathwatch.
Annual rings mostly uncountable,
but where visible run at about
6-8 per inch.

Bronze plate on enclosure:
THIS TREE SUPPOSED TO BE
Six Hundred Years Old 1st Jany
         1800.
May Man Still Guard thy Venerable form
From the Rude Blasts, and Tempestuous
storm.
[18356-18357]
8356
Still mayest thou Flourish
    through Succeeding time,
And Last, Long Last the Wonder
of the Clime.
  Original trunk very fluted
Bark reticulate. Epicormics few
but flourishing; one may gener-
ate a new limb.
  In practice surroundings, with 
oaks, chestnuts, Pinus nigra,
cedars,  &c but no trees
obviously >250 y.
 Nuts this year seem to
have been small and not good.

8357
New trunks tend not to be very
rootfast;  several have fallen and 
in some cases have taken root again. 
Girth 30'1"
  Secondary trunks are up to
c. 2 ft across and 40 ft high.
They overtop the original trunks and
are probably responsible for its
decline. Probably up to 150 years 
old.
Remarkably little lichenized.

  Also at Tortworth is a very
fine lime tee, some 100 ft high and
3 ft dia.  Appears to be Tilia cor-
data.  [SYMBOL] 12.
  Between Wotton-under-Edge 
and Tortworth is a country of
scattered farms and lanes. At
[18358-18359]
8358
Bradley is a fine green. Lanes
are winding and of irregular width.
  At 740942 is a scheduled
ancient monument consisting of
banks in grassland of unknown
purpose.
Hedge pattern is remarkably
complex. Hedge appears to be
mostly of 6-8 species, All are
well-kept. Entiree counr=try is
permanent improved grassa. Some
recent hedge-laying but most 
hedges are mechanically cut to
a rectsngular section.  Walls are
rare in this area (common on the
Cotswold plateau ansd S. of Kings-
wood).
Several roadside  purprestures
including one near Howley, some
100 yds x 2-10 yds, both of
8359
whose hedges survive, the younger 
one (of 3-4 species) having recently
beenb cut-&-laid ([SYMBOL]).  these are
all agricultural purprestures without
houses.
  Elms relatively few in this
country. No large trees left alive;
most of the dead ones have by
now been felled (as in S.E. Gloucs
generally). Suckers have died
within 3-10 ft of dead elms,
but away from standard trees
they are alive.
Hedgerow trees comparatively 
few, mostly oaks. A few oak
and ash pollards. Few trees
freestanding in fields.
From Damery up to Trotworth
is a very steep hill. The sides
of the holloway are abundantly
[18360-18361]
8360
covered with Allium ursinum - a
characteristic plant of the district,
tgough not usually in hedges -
up to about 40 ft above the
level of the river.
  Allium is not particularly
associated with other plants of
flushes or wet sites.
  Ferns slightly more frequent
than in E. England - chiefly
Scolopendrium.
 The road past Trotworth church
is straight, between hedges of 2
species.
  The little Avon is a clear
fast river. Banks have alder -
seen nowhere else in the area -
and abundant garlic.

Tortworth Great Copse (near
8361
Charfield). Intact, apart from 
big quarry now long-disused.

Grove in Wootton Hill.
Small circular enclosure
containing about a dozen Pinus
nigra trees planted in 1887 to
replace their predecessors planted 
in 1815 by then decrepit and
consumed in the Jubilee bonfire.
In 1937 some successors to
the 1887 trees were planted, but
have been overshadowed by the
latter and have not prospered.

Stachys alpina.
  On Wootton Hall, 756943.
Reserve of Gloucs Naturalists' 
Trust.
  Small pasture between road
[18362-18363]
8362
and wood.
[DIAG]
Pasture is separated from
road by ancient hedge (c.5 spp
which is strongly sinuous.
Between pasture & wood there
8363
is no bank or a slight one.
Wood strongly resembles West-
ridge Wood: beech coppice, ash
&c.
Stachys plants are in about
a dioen groups, marked by
pegs. Each group consists of
1-4 plants each with severasl
stems.  Theyu flowered well last
year. Most are at the foot
f the roadside lynchet, some
near the edge of the wood. Total
about 40 plants.

  The reserve is divided in
two by a fence. |The E. half is
evidently more grazed than the
W. Within the E. half [!!!the] one
group of plants has been pro-
tected by a fence. No grazing
has taken place since the
plants emerged this year, They
appear not to have been harmed
by past grazing.

Warren's Garden
Steep S.W. facing slope
Strong lychet at bottom with
big trees. Some of these are elms,
all long dead; no elm suckers,
perhaps because of grazing in
adjoining field.
  Oak in bottom fence has passed
through a staghead phase and
8365
is now going sragheaded again.
No obvious explanation for
changes.
  Myrtle-bush about 8 ft high.
Fruited copiously last year. Some
what damaged by frost.
  Ruscus fruiting freely.
  Deep almost stone-free soil.
  Old Prunus avium with
several very large cankers.
15 April.
Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge.
Limited to ducks, geese and
swans apart from a small trop-
ical aviary.
  Six species of flamingoes
which are fed on a soup contain
ing a carotenoid pigment which
maintaibns the proper colour of the
[18366-18367]
8366
feathers.
  Several pairs of black swans.
  A remarkably large proportion of
the world's ducks have blue bills.
  Scores of Hawaiian ne-ne
walk around among the visitors.
  Fine view over the Severn to
the Forest of Dean.
  There is a small decoy in
working order.  It
is a historic
decoy, remarkable  [DIAG]
for having two
parallel pairs of pipes.
  Trumpeter Swans sound very
like an inexperienced trumpeter.
The Nympsfield plateau
is of fone-grained reddish soil,
with fragments of linestone rag-
8367
stone.
  Scarp woods around Uley &
Owlpen are mainly of beech.
Some ash, mainly on the drier
slopes, e.g. below Nympsfield
Long Barrow.

16 April.
Avebury.
The stsnding stones are rela-
tively little lychenized.  Small tufts
of Ramalina high up; extensive
patches of thin crusts, inc. Rhizo-
carpon spp.  The western faces are
quite bare and silver-gray.
  The sarsen of Avebury often has
cavities of vsrious shapes formed
during consolidation. One block
has an embeddedd flint.
  The ditch of the Ring is
[18368-18369]
8368
is wet in the bottom at times.
avebury now has fewer hedge
trees than on Stukeley's plan
(which shows them in detail).
Some residual hedge banks within
the ring.
  Sarsen-stone blocks in the
church and other buildings sre 
little lichenized.

  In a bottom bretween Fy-
field and W. Overton are many
sarsens lying half-buried in
the grass of a meadow.

  Note a "Hailey Wood" in
Ashbury, W. Berks.
8369
  Several large p-types elms
left alive at Beverstone.

Derry Woods, Chippenham Forest.
  Steep slope.
  Good mixed coppice, chiefly
ash & hazel, part apparently in
rotation. Few old pines, &c.,
otherwise few old trees.
Abundant garlic.

Uffington White Horse.
  Good chalk grassland,insuf-
ficiently grazed on the horse,
though Uffington Castle is grazed.
The Dragon Hill is a knob of
chalk;  its summit appears artificially
levelled.
  Remarkable cattle-terracing on
the steep slopes.

tion with the Icknield Way.
About 4 ft long.
  Yew trees scattered among
grass or scrub on several of the
very steep spurs of the Chiltern

Aston-Rowant.

Elms.  Very few left alive between
Chinnor and Hemel-Hempstead.
8373
  The woods aound the White

growth.  This forms a dense
dark canopy. Ivy carpet; little
other vegetation. No evidence of
management. Occasional ashes
& other trees but no evidence of 
a succession to ash.
  On less stable scree there
is dominant ash; probably
some once-cuts. Cornus, Viber-
num lantana, privet &c. One
flourishing wych-elm in the
bottom. Small patch of elm
suckers - prob. internal origin.
  Ruins of two lime-kilns
and tiles from roof of a collapsed
building.
  Nettles restricted to near
a kiln near the S. end and
there dominant.
  Grass on floor of pit and
5385
there round top of S. edge. Invading
scrub has been removed with
considerable success.
  Sesili libanotis. Several
plants in grassland on lip of
S. edge. They grow chiefly
right in the             [DIAG]
edge of the 
cliff or on the
overhanging brow of
root-bound soil. A
few are said to grow
on ledges.
  Some rubbish is shot into
the pit by passers-by and is
doubtless the origin of plants
like Aubretia.
  Grass in the bottom is
kept very short by rabbits.

Elm Disease.
Fenstanton, St Ives, Lolworth,
King's Repton. Vast numbers of
elms, mainly Boxworth-type,
disease slight or none.
Abbot's Ripton. Many elms of
various genotypes, mainly Box-
worth-type. No definite
virulent disease. Lord De Ram-
sey has injected many trees
twice. See wood notebok.
Godmancheste, Conington. No
disease seen.
Knapwell. A few old pollards
8387
killed.
Abbot's Ripton Hall.
  Mainly Regency house, said
to have older parts.
  Magnificent garden, much of
it made for Lord De Ramsey.
  Two lakes made by damming
the beck. One of them stores
the runoff from 80 acres of
concrete on Alconbury airfield
which is used for irrigation.
  Swan on nest.
  Border devoted to albino
forgetmenots, tulips, bluebells, &c.
  Clumps of pampas-grass

  Beginnings of an hermitage
over the beck.
  Huge elm of very erect
habit.
  Two great oaks just ouside
the garden: one at 242776 (?x),
one at 241779 (spire)
  Swimmng-pool made in
the shape of the impluvium of

Platycerium, Selaginella,
Cyathea (loses all its leaves
in moving), &c. Tillandsia
(just planted; said to be more
8389
difficut than other bromeliands).
  Grey Border.
  Fine statuary & urnage.
  Tennis-court netting dis-
guised by alternate green & golden
hops.

     [Chateau d'Yquem!]

Abbot's Ripton.
  Street-plan of vilage has
evidently been totally altered.
Modern hedges are straight
and of pure hawthorn.
  Many rows of old pollards
& other elms.
  Relatively few hedges remain
on the estate, but there sre
many elms and oher hedgerow
trees.  De Ramsey planted 
[18390-18391]
8390
many elms (as being "the tree
of the county", altho' he doesn't
much like them) along the lane
to Wild Goose Leys just before
the epidemic.

Conington. Many old pollard
elms, almost as Knapwell.

 Elm fruiting this year is
mostly light or nil, except for
U. glabra and hybrids, many
of which have more than average
fruit even though their twigs
were exhausted by last year's
heavy crop.
