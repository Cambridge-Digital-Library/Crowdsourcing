TORTWORTH CHESTNUT
[DIAG]
Has a great central trunk, much
decayed, about 3/4 of whose cir-
cumference bears bark.  Four live
[18354-18355]
8354
limbs.  The rest of the tree
consists of five limbs missing
at or near the base of the
trunk, which have sprawled 
and taken root and sent up 
further trunks.
The oldest limbs have very
stubby twigs with annual incre-
ments of an inch or less.  The
younger & middle-aged limbs
vary much in vigour.
  Surrounded by 19th-cent. railing
and an old stone wall.
Inside enclosure.
Bluebells 50% dom.   Arum
Mercury 30%          Ru fv - [????]

                         one patch
8355
Several mercury clones
Even the oldest twigs fruit.
Original trunk forked into two,
both of which still bear branches,
though the N.W. one is almost dead
save for epicormics.  The top of this
latter fell many years ago and
is still lying about.  Slightly
attaqcked by wet-rot & deathwatch.
Annual rings mostly uncountable,
but where visible run at about
6-8 per inch.

Bronze plate on enclosure:
THIS TREE SUPPOSED TO BE
Six Hundred Years Old 1st Jany
         1800.
May Man Still Guard thy Venerable form
From the Rude Blasts, and Tempestuous
storm.
[18356-18357]
8356
Still mayest thou Flourish
    through Succeeding time,
And Last, Long Last the Wonder
of the Clime.
  Original trunk very fluted
Bark reticulate. Epicormics few
but flourishing; one may gener-
ate a new limb.
