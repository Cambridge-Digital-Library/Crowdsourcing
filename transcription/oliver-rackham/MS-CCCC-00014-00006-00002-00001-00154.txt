The above are the
numbers of rings (starting
with the sapling) on three
spearate stool ashes cut
today.
After heavy rain the
Wood has nearly its maximum
standing water. Large pools

on the 1st & 2nd N. ridge.
Pond full well up the triple
oak.
The 1969 plot is drier
thank the 1968 and has no
standing water.
Near the inside edge of
the 1970 plot is the "deer's
drinking bowl", a stool ash
with the middle rotter out and
a complete sound rim forming
a water-filled bowl. Many
deer tracks around.
No leaves visible of
oxlips, living or dead: a 
small proportion of plants
have buds which just break 
the surface.
No bluebells visible.

Ajuga is the most con-
spicuous small herb. [SYMBOL]

The Passiflorae are flour-
ishing and appear quite
undamaged by frost.
The two Umbilicus plants
in the Sarcophagus wall are
[!!!!]ver[!!!!] completely green and un-
damaged. [SYMBOL]
January 22.
A very warm day with
heavy rain in the evening. [SYMBOL]
January 23.
After much rain in the
last few days, the river
rose to its highest this winter,
and about noon had
flooded large areas of the fen.

Not much flooding [!!!!]below[!!!!]above
Fen Causeway. Crusoe's Island
and the Anchor quay were
both several inches 'under'.
January 24.
Again very warm and
sticky.
There has been much flood-
ing on the E. side of the river
opposite Grantchester Meadows.
Comparatively little in the
MeadowsL only the lamp-post
field is under.
A great elm near the
beginning of Grantchester Mea-
dows has fallen, the roots
having given way. [SYMBOL]

Final height of Ono-

January 26.
The Bourn Brook is very high
(probably higher still in the last
few days). The field imme-
diately N. of Toft Bridge is more
than half under water, which 
comes up to the base of the
big elm in that field and 
nearly up to the road. Φ8.

February 1.
Buff Wood (with D.E. Coombe;
examination of 1969 coppice
plot with further plans).
Hazel is flowering occas-
ionally in the Wood.
Primroses are flowering
copiously in the 1968 coppice
plot: each plant usually
has several flowers and
a number of leaves.
Oxlips are just visible.
A maple and small poplar
growing together in the 1968
coppice have been uprooted.

1969 coppice.
All the undergrowth & bram-
bles have been cut and burnt.

[11618-11619]
1618
Some of the fallen timber
has been burnt but much
remains particularly in the
back of the plot.
There are several groups
of oaks which interfere with
one another and could do with
thinning. Oaks down to 6 in. dia.
Elms are in a variety of
sizes but those under c. 3 in.
are much less frequent in the
"back" of the plot than the front.
There is a greater admixture
of ash and maple in the front
several of the ash have been
cut before but the only big
stool is on the moat bank.
No exotics.

have ivy growing over them.
When felled, the shakes
were seen to extend to the
middle of the tree. At the
butt, and also about [????]8ft
up, there was copious exu-
dation from the shakes on
the upper side. Below each
of these [????] cuts the interior
was wet but no actual
flow. Exudate colourless,
slight tendency to froth, smell
as usual for elm wood,
taste slightly lactic.
Wet-wood cylinder
slightly larger at butt than
in section. The wet-wood
is dark like heart-wood,
rather lighter above, darkening9
