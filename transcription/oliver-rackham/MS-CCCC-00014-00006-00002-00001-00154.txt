Haylet Wood (Coppicing).
The above are the
numbers of rings (starting
with the sapling) on three
spearate stool ashes cut
today.
After heavy rain the
Wood has nearly its maximum
standing water. Large pools

on the 1st & 2nd N. ridge.
Pond full well up the triple
oak.
The 1969 plot is drier
thank the 1968 and has no
standing water.
Near the inside edge of
the 1970 plot is the "deer's
drinking bowl", a stool ash
with the middle rotter out and
a complete sound rim forming
a water-filled bowl. Many
deer tracks around.
No leaves visible of
oxlips, living or dead: a 
small proportion of plants
have buds which just break 
the surface.
No bluebells visible.

January 22.
A very warm day with
heavy rain in the evening. [SYMBOL]
January 23.
After much rain in the
last few days, the river
rose to its highest this winter,
and about noon had
flooded large areas of the fen.

opposite Grantchester Meadows.
Comparatively little in the
MeadowsL only the lamp-post
field is under.
A great elm near the
beginning of Grantchester Mea-
dows has fallen, the roots
having given way. [SYMBOL]

The Bourn Brook is very high
(probably higher still in the last
few days). The field imme-
diately N. of Toft Bridge is more
than half under water, which 
comes up to the base of the
big elm in that field and 
nearly up to the road. Φ8.

Buff Wood (with D.E. Coombe;
examination of 1969 coppice
plot with further plans).
Hazel is flowering occas-
ionally in the Wood.
Primroses are flowering
copiously in the 1968 coppice
plot: each plant usually
has several flowers and
a number of leaves.
Oxlips are just visible.
A maple and small poplar
growing together in the 1968
coppice have been uprooted.

1969 coppice.
All the undergrowth & bram-
bles have been cut and burnt.

[11618-11619]
1618
Some of the fallen timber
has been burnt but much
remains particularly in the
back of the plot.
There are several groups
of oaks which interfere with
one another and could do with
thinning. Oaks down to 6 in. dia.
Elms are in a variety of
sizes but those under c. 3 in.
are much less frequent in the
"back" of the plot than the front.
There is a greater admixture
of ash and maple in the front
several of the ash have been
cut before but the only big
stool is on the moat bank.
No exotics.

[11620-11621]

have ivy growing over them.
When felled, the shakes
were seen to extend to the
middle of the tree. At the
butt, and also about [????]8ft
up, there was copious exu-
dation from the shakes on
the upper side. Below each
of these [????] cuts the interior
was wet but no actual
flow. Exudate colourless,
slight tendency to froth, smell
as usual for elm wood,
taste slightly lactic.
Wet-wood cylinder
slightly larger at butt than
in section. The wet-wood
is dark like heart-wood,
rather lighter above, darkening9

with age, darker around
the shakes which are the 
wettest parts.
Shakes still visible in
the wet-wood about half
way up the tree.
Wet-wood peters out
in the crown branches. Where
it looks very like heartwood
but is recognized by being
very wet but the sapwood
dry. It communicates with
the outside by running
into a few snags, but these
are probably secondary exits.
The infection almost certainly
started in the stool.
The wet-wood core is
very uniform at any one level.

1623
[DIAG]

[11624-11625]
1624
At c. 8 ft. it occupies some
35 rings, but the boundary
is somewhat helical as shown
in the diagram. Edge sharp
with discolouration beyond it.
Lobes rather few except along
big shakes.
One shake, though gaping
widely in the section, has 2
years' growth of callus over it.

Several other elms show
signs of wet-wood but none
is flowing now.

Oaks are of various habits,
usually somewhat lower than
the elms but seldom
seriously suppressed. They

1625
appear to be mostly older.
Some are very good and 
clean-grown.

Management suggestions.
Money is probably too short
for this plot to be done as
the 1968 plot was. Should
be spent in this order:
(a) Dealing with fallen timber
where in the way.
(b) Felling elms that seriously
interfere with oaks.
(c) Thinning as large an area
as possible down to a scien-
tifically desirable density of
about 60 trees to the acre.
This should include a number
of small and medium-sized

[11626-11627]
1626
elms l to be thinned further
at the next rotation if necessary),
ash, and a few maple. Optimum
canopy density is higher than
on the 1968 plot as there is
only one coppice storey here.
Oaks should not be felled 
unless seriously interfering with
one another.
About 6 elms of 2-3 in.
diameter and 3 of 4-6 in.
diameter to be left for wet-wood
investigation.
[DIAG]
A rabbit was seen
in the 1968 plot.
A dog appears to 
visit the wood frequently
from the village.

Hayley Coppicing.

Largest fire last time was
13 ft dia. very symmetrical
with a patch of charcoal in
the middle. Radiation frost
froze the white loose ash
more than anything else
in the clearing. Φ10
Maple stool S. of Glade.
13 trunks. About 5ft X 0.
Visible from S. margin.
Oxlips: a minority just 
visible above decayed leaves.
Mercury: a very small
proportion emerging.
Ptilidium: flourishing
and extending oer the fallen

1629
oak in the E section.
There is a rapid flow
of water up to 2 in. deep over
the S.E. ride in two places,
as well as by the Hayley
Ditch culvert. Flow rapid
along the S. side [!!!!]E[!!!!]W. from Hay-
ley Ditch. Water has been
nearly 1ft deep during heavy
rain, judging by debris lodged
in trees and bushes. Flow
hardly detectable [!!!!]W.[!!!!]E. of the Ditch.
There is much standing
water on the coppice plot and 
a large area of the ground
is heavily poached.
In the N.E. half of the
Triangle, the furrows are
under water to E. 1 ft deep.

[11630-11631]
1639
They are dry elsewhere.
[DIAG]

1631
A small pool has formed
just outside the S.W. corner
of the wood, owing to exces-
sive runoff from the wood
held back by the nibble
of a collapsed culvert.
Coppicing was almost
finished.

[DIAG]
[11632-11633]
February 4.
Aconites are flowering abun-
dantly at Fanshawe. Snowdrops
not yet out.
February 6.
The warm spell has come
to an abrupt end with snow
falling late in the day to pro-
duce a thin permanent layer.
February 7.
A cold spell with occasional
light snow showers maintaining
the layer.
Between 6.30 and 7.45 p.m.
there was a sudden, unexpected;
and very intense snowstorm.
Several inches of light powdery
snow fell, driven by a strong
N.W. wind which filled the air.

1633
with suffocating ice crystals. At
times it was impossible to
bicycle in the storm, while the
rapidly-accumulating snow
on the ground made progress
hazardous and the ice dust
pervaded everywhere. The
Queensboro' Feast, held this even-
ing, was decimated: e.g. the
Senior Tutor was reported stuck 
at Arrington. Some guests spent
the night on camp beds in the
Master's Lodge. Some outlying
parts of Cambridge were reported
inaccessible.
The snow was agitated by
dust-devils and settled on all
sides of walls and trees,
covering them in a most curious

[11634-11635]
1634
manner.
February 8.
No further snowfall after
midnight. A cloudless day.
Extreme frost, the most severe
this year, lasting all day.
About 1 1/2 in. of ice [!!!!]fell[!!!!] on
the Leckhampton pool, most
of it formed in one night. Ice
also on all backwaters &
ditches, & on pools on Sheep's 
reen. None on the river save
a large area of rather thin
ice on Newnham mill pool.
General depth of snow
probably 4 1/2 - 5 in., but very
uneven through drifting. Trees
heavily loaded early, but much
of this soon fell off in the sun.

1635
No damage observed. Snow
melted only in the sun, and
probably on the ground from
underneath.
Abundant icicles in the
Old Court, and heavy incrus-
tations around [????]e Garden
House sluice.
Ice formed inside all my
windows, but the plants on
the window-ledge appear un-
hurt. Φ 11
This drying frost has
withered Passiflora and other
evergreens. The frost penetrat-
ing under the arches of
Leckhampton has killed at the
leaves of the two large tub
Amaryllises there.

[11636-11637]
1636
The large and decrepit elm
directly outside the back gate
of King's has a stem flow
from a sawn-off branch some
6 in. dia. about 12ft up the
tree. This continued active in
the frost and the copious
exudate formed a series of
dropping icicles up to c. 2ft
long. Colour of light ale. Φ 15
One or two gulls seen 
over Cambridge.
Little or no road treat-
ment (Saturday) except along
Queens' Road. K.P. and Grange
Road partly cleared themselves:
Sidgwick Av. & Silver Str. very 
bad throughout the day & Selwyn
Gard. almost impassable. [SYMBOL]

Icicles about 3 ft long from
water shoots. Φ17
Roof of chancel: ash{????]ed

timbers. Victorian.
Nave roof: Perp., cambered,
very massive principals

[DIAG]

Large knots.
Most of the timbers.

[11638-11639]
1638
in this church are of trees
1'6" dia. or more. The 
cambers of the nave principals
make use of natural angles.

Another cloudless day,
temperature hardly reaching
freezing. No skating yet. Ice
again inside windows.
The following route traver-
sed: Selw. G. - Barton Road -
Barton - Comberton - Toft - Hard-
wick - Madingly Road - Coton
- Cambridge.
THere is little snow on the
fields in general, so that the 
plough furrows are everywhere
exposed on the sunward side.
The quantity has doubtless been

1639
reducted by sun & ground
thawing. It is difficult to sup-
pose that much has blown
away because drifts are not
very large.
Drifts are formed by the
N.W. wind. In ditches they
take the form of elegant
curling cornices with much
small-scale detail of ridges
and striations 1/4 in. wide or
less. Φ[????]16. Smaller ditches filled
altogether.
Drifts above ground form
in the lee of cut-down
hedges and especually in the
lee of gaps in fall hedges or
belts. They are long down-
-wind ridges up to c. 20 ft

[11640-11641]
1640
long. Depths exceeding
2 ft between Barton & Camber-
ton, Hardwick & Toft, and on
the Coton turn; greatest
depth less than 3 ft. All 
roads now passable with
little or no difficulty, unlike
Selwyn Gardens and others in
Cambridge.
A wren was seen about
the old elms in [!!!!]Coton back[!!!!]
Toft back lane.
There are some fine old
pollard elms immediately S. of
Comberton church.

Madingley Wood.
About half that part 
of the Wood within the Ameri-
can Cemetery is apparently
unaltered. The part nearest
the road, with the adjoining
belt, has been altered by
landscaping, and the N.E.
corner has been encroached 
on by building &c.
There are a few larches
in the E. part of the Wood
in the area shown.
The tree [SYMBOL] is an old
ash in the former belt which
partly collapsed, probably in
the summer gales.
Many rabbit tracks in 
the snow lead under the south

1643
gate, perhaps because there
is now a rabbit-fence E.
of the gate. The gate was
at one time rabbit-proof but
the wire at one end has got
lifted. [SYMBOL]
February 10.
Another nearly cloudless day.
Slight thaw.
February 11.
About 3 in. of heavy com-
pact snow fell in the night
& early morning. A thaw 
set in and it rained for
much of the day. The snow
very slowly melted.
Snow extended to the
outskirts of London, by now
completely covering the fields.

[11644-11645]
1644
There has been snow in the
built-up area but it has
almost all gone.
There are substantial ice
floes on Regent's Canal.
February 12.
The cold brilliant anticyclone
continues. Snow slowly decreases
mainly by evaporation.
February 13.
A slight thaw in the after-
noon. The river is quite high
(submerging part of the Anchor
quay).
Some flooding occurred in
the College Chapel by the holes
in the N. parapet which should 
let the water out getting
blocked with ice. The melting

1645
of the snow on the N. face of
the roof then filled with gutter
with water until it overflowed
down the inside of the wall
under the slates. A similar
flood was just averted on the
roof of the Hall lobby.
February 14.
Slight snowfall in the early 
morning. Another clear day
with slight melting and evap-
oration.
February 15.
A hard night frost with
ice inside the windows.
Snow cover in the Fens
varies but about half the 
fields are more than half
covered. The ditches have

[11646-11647]
1646
snow cornices and the smaller
ones are quite filled. All
shallow water is thickly frozen
but the rivers are clear and
Ely gravel pits have a very thin 
skin.
Snow cover gradually in-
creases eastwards and in Nor-
wich is almost continuous
and about 5 in. deep. A
hard frost continues. No ice
on the Wensum, although
backwaters of the Yare and
moats near Eaton are
frozen over.
No plants in flower (64 H.L.).
About 1 in. of snow fell in 
Norwich in the afternoon,
and more in the early evening.

This is a levelling survey
made at the S. end of
Hayley Ditch where a
start was made on building
an embanked pond.
The present water level in
the Ditch is controlled by a
gap A between the bank and

1649
the boundary bank. The
depth cannot exceed 9 in. This
gap A could be blocked
by a bank to increase the
depth of water by 10 in.
Dam A would then have to 
be extended northward by
heightening Hayley Ditch
bank. When the total height
reached 14 in. the overflow
would be into the boundary
ditch through the low place
B. If a second dam were
made here the two could
he heightened till the water
level was about 30 in. above
the present, which would
flood probably about half
an acre. The limitation

[11650-11651]
1650
[DIAG]

1651
[DIAG]

[11652-11653]
1652
would then be some low
places in the boundary ditch
E. of B.
Work was started on
two dams:
(i) A massive bank across
gap A. The existing vegeta-
tion (privet thicket) was cut 
down and loose silt, leaf-
mould, and twigs removed
as far as possible to get
a good foundation. A line
of stakes was then driven
to be interwoven with hazels
later. This is to be buried
in a clay bank, which was 
carried up c. 4 in. above
present water level.
(ii) A slighter bank was begun

1653
in gap B.
Material mainly dug
from a pit in the area to be
flooded. A little for bank A
was dug locally. The clay
was puddled by treading
or hammering after laying.

Coppicing was finished
and a few of the old ash
stools faced up and thorned.

Heavy snowfall in the
night and on the way to
Hayley Wood. 10.50 - 11.20 a.m.,
at times enough to blot out
the countryside. Total extra
depth c.3 in.
The whole of Hayley is

[11654-11655]
1654
snow-covered. Most of this 
appears to be new snow,
and most of the ground
is covered with ice under
the snow, partly formed by
frozen water and partly
by ve[????]irnt snow. Snow
depth usually c. 3 in.; very
uniform in the Wood but
depths of over 1 ft in drifts
by the level crossing. Snow
on the branches of trees
very impressive, 19 particularly in
Hayley Lane (Φ[SYMBOL]); differenti-
ates large & small coppice
layers to the 25 S.E. of the cop=
pice plots (Φ[SYMBOL]).
Ice on the Pond and
on Hayley Ditch Pond was

1655
strong enough to walk on;
in both cases [!!!!]about[!!!!] 3 in.
thick. Repeated walking 
and axeing of timber
[!!!!]broke[!!!!] cracked that on the
Ditch Pond but it still
held firm. Much of the ash
swamp is solidly frozen.
Ice on ride pools is not
always strong enough to
walk on.
No tracks seen in the
new snow except a few
probably of hares.
Development of hazel
catkins is held up.
No thaw except in sun,
but Hayley Ditch does run
a trickle.

Snow persists within a
few inches of a bonfire, even
in intense radiation.
Little difference is noticed
when felling frozen trees, though
if moribund they may con-
tain ice crystals.
Very few birds seen.
Carex acutiformis has
been badly damaged by
frost: at least half the
length of the leaves appears
quite dry.

The new snow has filled
many roadside ditches com-
pletely but there has been
little drifting.

1659
February 17.
Further light snow showers.
The Leckhampton Pool ice
is strong enough to walk on.
A frost almost all day.
February 18.
The backwaters and
ditches by the river are frozen,
but there has not been any
skating. The river itself is 
still quite clear and fast.
February 19.
Much snow encountered
in the fields on the way to
Monks' Wood, but the roads are
quite clear.
When returning from
Monks' Wood in the evening,
we met a heavy snowfall

[11660-11661]
1660
with a strong E. wind. It
started to lie on the roads.
February 20.
About 2 in. of new snow
fell during the night and
early morning.
A fairly rapid thaw set 
in during the day and there
was light continuous rain.
February 21.
The thaw and rain con-
tinued and the snow cover
is broken up.
February 22.
A very fine day with con-
tinuing rapid thaw. Little snow
left by evening.
February 23.
The river is running

1661
high and part of the Anchor 
quay is awash.
Privet hedges have been
severely damaged and most
of the leaves are a curious
fawn colour with only sickly
traces of green.
The Passiflorae have
had all their leaves killed
save a few near the base.
The Clematic shows no 
sign of damage.
The Eccremocarpos shows no
sign of life.
The apple tree overhanging
the Sarcophagus was finally
cut back so that it no longer
does so.
The wound on the trunk

[11662-11663]
1662
of the Fanshawe beech shows 
further deterioration. The
pitch and ribiit-wire covering
has badly cracked and a
small resupinate sporophore
appears to be pushing from
underneath it at one side.
Liquid comes out from the
cavity at the bottom left.
February 24.
The last traces of snow
melted in Leckhampton
today, but some still remains
between Cambridge and
Grantchester in ditches and the
lee of hedges.
The river at its height
submerged the Anchor quay
by several inches, but did

1663
not quite reach the level of
January 23 in Sheep's Green.
The Leckhampton swim-
ming-pool and some of the
pools in Sheep's Green still
have thick ice, but are
breaking up.
February 27.
Light snow and sleet feel
at times.
February 28.
Slight snowfall in the 
early morning at Cambridge.
In the Fens, many ditches
are still full of old snow.
A light powdering of new snow
in places.
The Ouse Washes are
entirely under deep water.

[11664-11665]
1664
A flock of several thousand
duck was roosting on the
water a few years N.W.
of the rail way embankment.
There are only patches of
water in the E. end of the
Nene Washes. Much of the
area has been ploughed.
A few horned sheep were
seen up to their hocks in
mud.
E. of Cowbit, by the Welland

Two hares were seen
about 10 a.m. (summer time)

Spalding is almost certainly
built directly on the silt fen
but Pinchbeck may be on a
very low island.
The edge of the Marshland
between South 40 ft Diam
& Helpringham is quite abrupt
some of the inner marshland
is covered with a peculiar
tawny gravel found also 
on the upland. There is 
no continuous peat between
the silt fen and upland,
but small pockets of peat
and skirt were seen.
On the Cornbrash of the
Lincoln Edge, the soil is
very shallow and much
rock is brought up by the

plough.
There is a fine wooded
fen with birch by the rail-
way on level ground at 
Blankney.
A tongue of fenland with
deep peat reaches up the
valley and across the rail-
way at Dunston.
The Witham fens at Lincoln
have much peat, which is
cut to form turf dykes at
the sewage farm.

Large snow cornices in

Gainsboro' and Sheffield.
In Sheffield itself, snow
distribution varies much with
altitude. None at all in the 
lower part of the town. Heaps
of old snow in the streets, and
occasional patches on side-
-walks, down to 400 ft. Con-
tinuous cover at c. 700 ft.
At the Lloyds' house, 930 ft.,
there has been continuous
snow cover for a month.
Depth very uneven but 
average about 12 in. Much
snow has fallen in the last
few days (about 1 in. early

[11668-11669]
1668
today) and it lies on
many roofs and on hedges
and trees; on the ground
it is added to verfirnt
remains of earlier falls.
There is solid ice on
most open water in Shef-
field.
March 1. 
Hallam Head
Sheffield
A light powdering of
further snow fell in the
night.
Sheffield, Rotherham, &
Doncaster are confluent
along the railway with
continuous houses and in-
dustry, except for a small
gap in the dolomite belt
W. of Warmsworth.

1669
The dolomite exposed
between Conisbrough and Warms-
worth is a coursely blocky
material, yellow (almost as
deep as Ham Hill), like the
cliff dolomite of the Dolomites,
and a building stone. There
are vast quarries and cement
works. To the E. is a short
stretch of a pinkish semi-rag
stone probably of the same
formation.
In the dolomite there are
some ancient quarries with
cliffs and pits, and some 
bold, precipices probably also
produced by quarrying. The
old quarries have wood-
land of ash and sycamore

[11670-11671]
1670
with occasional oak. No
understorey, but abundany
ivy on the trunks and the
ground.
The Idle at Bawtry has
overflowed to a width of
about 1/4 mile.
N.W. of Rossington is
a tract of apparently recent
birch woodland with even-
-sized young oaks.
Most of the W. end of the
Nene Washes is quite dry.

Outer 7 narrow. No trans

Ash. About 40% of the
large trees, mainly in small 
groups. Probably all maidens.
Up to c. 1 ft dia.
Tall and fast-grown
trees. Without exception, all
are going back at the
top, and about half are
dead except for epicormic
shoots from the trunk; a
few dead altogether. This
is not due to canker
which is rare and never
serious. It strong suggest
worsening drainage.
One tree felled (C).

This is strong evidence
for a steady decline of drain-
age in the 1930s without any
re-draining in the 2nd war.
Armillaria may be a 
factor but is not common.
No young trees.

Alder. About 40% of the
mature trees. Similar to
ash in size but somewhat

1679
taller. Many appear to
have been coppiced once.
Visible signs of water-
logging appear only in
a few of the largest, which
show slight crown die-back.

Salix fragilis. Frequent large
trees. Many of them fall
over, especially in groups
as this is a gregarious
species. The shallow roots
form root plates standing
up about 6 ft, thinner
than usual with fallen
willows.
The Snail main stream is
spanned in several places
by willows and poplars

[11680-11681]

fallen across it.

Poplars. Frequent along the
Snail embankment, rare
elsewhere. Tree like P. tre-
mula and with similar leaves,
but very large and with
bosses on the trunk. Bark
much as in large P. tre-
mula.
On the banks are several
fallen trees. One examined
on this side has recently 
fallen. Trunk abou 18 in.
dia. Roots decayed and
thus not forming a root
plate: no obvious fungi and
Armillaria almost ruled
out.

1681
On cutting onto the trunk
about 4 ft up a discolour-
ation was found. Bright
yellowish - golden - brown,
margin sharply defined
with a slight clay-brown border.
Discoloured wood little al-
tered in strength, markedly
wet compared with the white
wood. Discolouration to
within c. 1 in of the wood
surface. Dr Rishbeth pronoun-
ces this to be wet-wood.
No small trees.

Sallows Frequent in various
places.

Elder. Many large trees along

[11682-11683]
1682
the embankment. Apparently
venerable but section A shows
that their age can be decep=
tive.

Hawthorn. Frequent along
embarkment, not elsewhere.

The open areas have
reed-swamp with Phragmites
or sometimes Phalaris.
The peat surface is above
[!!!!]dry[!!!!] water in most places,
but water is only an inch
or so down and fills all
hollows. Depth of peat un-
known. Drains mostly
choked, up to 3 ft deep in a
few places but usually less.

1683
sleepers as bridges remain
from an earlier path system.
The river bank is clay.
In one place where the
peat surface is under
water for a considerable
stretch, a causeway was
made by cutting trees (mainly
sallow) to lengths of c. 18 in.
and laying them transversely.
A length of 50-60 yards was
laid by about 10 people in
about 1 1/2 hours. This has
no longitudinal members and
only works if the water is
shallow enough not to float 
the logs.
A gold-crest was seen
by the Snail main stream.

[11684-11685]
1684
It went about its business
within 10 yards of several
people eating. Slightly smaller
than a wren, colours predom-
inantly yellowist gray with
dull black and white stripes
over the head. The golden
crest is an inconspicuous
yellowish patch on the fore-
head. It poked about on
mud at the edge of the
river and in and among
fallen sallows.

Ivy. Frequent on the ground
on and near the Snail
bank. Rarely on trees, or 
on the peat.

1685
Notes that ash trees do
not fall or, apparently,
suffer root damage.

Lichens are very good on
ash (e.g. Evernia prunastri)
and rosettes of Parmelia
caperata reach 9 in. dia.

Sycamore. A few trees only,
maximum size c. 20 ft high
X 3 in. dia. On peat.
Much attacked by squirrels
(almost certainly) to the exclu-
sion of other tree spp. Large
areas of bark are removed down
to the wood. All the damage is 
apparently last year's, and
there has been considerable

[11686-11687]
1686
healing and callus formation
from the edge and from numer-
ous small islands of cambium
remaining, even in one severe
case where the tree was barked
all round for 4 ft up from the
base but the top still lived.
This may well limit the
performance of this species.

Snow lies under a few
hedges in the Fordham area.

March 3.
The Leckhampton bay tree
appears to have survived the
frost uninjured although not
protected in any way. All but
one or two of the Chimonanthus

1687
flowers have perished.

March 4.
Buff Wood (D.E.C. and others;
visiting coppice and selecting
area to be cut by But. Gard.
for small stakes). See map on 
p. 2078.
Additions to Flora:
1. Snowdrop. Several plants
by road opposite the George,
all outside the wood fence
but in the outermost road
ditch.
2. Holly. One plant c. 6 in. high
in the Handle.

The farmer has cut down 
all the scrub on the W. side

[11688]
of the wood outside the wood
fence.
Frost damage:
1. Ivy. Many leaves entirely
or partly killed (on trees).
2. Daphne. Many leaves entirely
or partly killed (plant in 1968
coppice). Dead areas nearly
white, buff tinge. Probably no
permanent damage.
3. Primrose. Many flowers
badly damaged and water
soaked, but remaining open;
buds undamaged and new
ones opening rapidly.
