Haylet Wood (Coppicing).
The above are the
numbers of rings (starting
with the sapling) on three
spearate stool ashes cut
today.
After heavy rain the
Wood has nearly its maximum
standing water. Large pools

[11610-11611]

on the 1st & 2nd N. ridge.
Pond full well up the triple
oak.
The 1969 plot is drier
thank the 1968 and has no
standing water.
Near the inside edge of
the 1970 plot is the "deer's
drinking bowl", a stool ash
with the middle rotter out and
a complete sound rim forming
a water-filled bowl. Many
deer tracks around.
No leaves visible of
oxlips, living or dead: a 
small proportion of plants
have buds which just break 
the surface.
No bluebells visible.

Ajuga is the most con-
spicuous small herb. [SYMBOL]

January 22.
A very warm day with
heavy rain in the evening. [SYMBOL]
January 23.
After much rain in the
last few days, the river
rose to its highest this winter,
and about noon had
flooded large areas of the fen.

There has been much flood-
ing on the E. side of the river
opposite Grantchester Meadows.
Comparatively little in the
MeadowsL only the lamp-post
field is under.
A great elm near the
beginning of Grantchester Mea-
dows has fallen, the roots
having given way. [SYMBOL]

The Bourn Brook is very high
(probably higher still in the last
few days). The field imme-
diately N. of Toft Bridge is more
than half under water, which 
comes up to the base of the
big elm in that field and 
nearly up to the road. Φ8.

Buff Wood (with D.E. Coombe;
examination of 1969 coppice
plot with further plans).
Hazel is flowering occas-
ionally in the Wood.
Primroses are flowering
copiously in the 1968 coppice
plot: each plant usually
has several flowers and
a number of leaves.
Oxlips are just visible.
A maple and small poplar
growing together in the 1968
coppice have been uprooted.

1969 coppice.
All the undergrowth & bram-
bles have been cut and burnt.

[11618-11619]
1618
Some of the fallen timber
has been burnt but much
remains particularly in the
back of the plot.
There are several groups
of oaks which interfere with
one another and could do with
thinning. Oaks down to 6 in. dia.
Elms are in a variety of
sizes but those under c. 3 in.
are much less frequent in the
"back" of the plot than the front.
There is a greater admixture
of ash and maple in the front
several of the ash have been
cut before but the only big
stool is on the moat bank.
No exotics.

[11620-11621]
1620
have ivy growing over them.
When felled, the shakes
were seen to extend to the
middle of the tree. At the
butt, and also about [????]8ft
up, there was copious exu-
dation from the shakes on
the upper side. Below each
of these [????] cuts the interior
was wet but no actual
flow. Exudate colourless,
slight tendency to froth, smell
as usual for elm wood,
taste slightly lactic.
Wet-wood cylinder
slightly larger at butt than
in section. The wet-wood
is dark like heart-wood,
rather lighter above, darkening9

with age, darker around
the shakes which are the 
wettest parts.
Shakes still visible in
the wet-wood about half
way up the tree.
Wet-wood peters out
in the crown branches. Where
it looks very like heartwood
but is recognized by being
very wet but the sapwood
dry. It communicates with
the outside by running
into a few snags, but these
are probably secondary exits.
The infection almost certainly
started in the stool.
The wet-wood core is
very uniform at any one level.

1623
[DIAG]

[11624-11625]
1624
At c. 8 ft. it occupies some
35 rings, but the boundary
is somewhat helical as shown
in the diagram. Edge sharp
with discolouration beyond it.
Lobes rather few except along
big shakes.
One shake, though gaping
widely in the section, has 2
years' growth of callus over it.

Several other elms show
signs of wet-wood but none
is flowing now.

Oaks are of various habits,
usually somewhat lower than
the elms but seldom
seriously suppressed. They

1625
appear to be mostly older.
Some are very good and 
clean-grown.

Management suggestions.
Money is probably too short
for this plot to be done as
the 1968 plot was. Should
be spent in this order:
(a) Dealing with fallen timber
where in the way.
(b) Felling elms that seriously
interfere with oaks.
(c) Thinning as large an area
as possible down to a scien-
tifically desirable density of
about 60 trees to the acre.
This should include a number
of small and medium-sized

[11626-11627]
1626
elms l to be thinned further
at the next rotation if necessary),
ash, and a few maple. Optimum
canopy density is higher than
on the 1968 plot as there is
only one coppice storey here.
Oaks should not be felled 
unless seriously interfering with
one another.
About 6 elms of 2-3 in.
diameter and 3 of 4-6 in.
diameter to be left for wet-wood
investigation.
[DIAG]
A rabbit was seen
in the 1968 plot.
A dog appears to 
visit the wood frequently
from the village.

Hayley Coppicing.

Largest fire last time was
13 ft dia. very symmetrical
with a patch of charcoal in
the middle. Radiation frost
froze the white loose ash
more than anything else
in the clearing. Φ10
Maple stool S. of Glade.
13 trunks. About 5ft X 0.
Visible from S. margin.
Oxlips: a minority just 
visible above decayed leaves.
Mercury: a very small
proportion emerging.
Ptilidium: flourishing
and extending oer the fallen

1629
oak in the E section.
There is a rapid flow
of water up to 2 in. deep over
the S.E. ride in two places,
as well as by the Hayley
Ditch culvert. Flow rapid
along the S. side [!!!!]E[!!!!]W. from Hay-
ley Ditch. Water has been
nearly 1ft deep during heavy
rain, judging by debris lodged
in trees and bushes. Flow
hardly detectable [!!!!]W.[!!!!]E. of the Ditch.
There is much standing
water on the coppice plot and 
a large area of the ground
is heavily poached.
In the N.E. half of the
Triangle, the furrows are
under water to E. 1 ft deep.

[11630-11631]
1639
They are dry elsewhere.
[DIAG]

1631
A small pool has formed
just outside the S.W. corner
of the wood, owing to exces-
sive runoff from the wood
held back by the nibble
of a collapsed culvert.
Coppicing was almost
finished.

[DIAG]
[11632-11633]
February 4.
Aconites are flowering abun-
dantly at Fanshawe. Snowdrops
not yet out.
February 6.
The warm spell has come
to an abrupt end with snow
falling late in the day to pro-
duce a thin permanent layer.
February 7.
A cold spell with occasional
light snow showers maintaining
the layer.
Between 6.30 and 7.45 p.m.
there was a sudden, unexpected;
and very intense snowstorm.
Several inches of light powdery
snow fell, driven by a strong
N.W. wind which filled the air.

1633
with suffocating ice crystals. At
times it was impossible to
bicycle in the storm, while the
rapidly-accumulating snow
on the ground made progress
hazardous and the ice dust
pervaded everywhere. The
Queensboro' Feast, held this even-
ing, was decimated: e.g. the
Senior Tutor was reported stuck 
at Arrington. Some guests spent
the night on camp beds in the
Master's Lodge. Some outlying
parts of Cambridge were reported
inaccessible.
The snow was agitated by
dust-devils and settled on all
sides of walls and trees,
covering them in a most curious

[11634-11635]
1634
manner.
February 8.
No further snowfall after
midnight. A cloudless day.
Extreme frost, the most severe
this year, lasting all day.
About 1 1/2 in. of ice [!!!!]fell[!!!!] on
the Leckhampton pool, most
of it formed in one night. Ice
also on all backwaters &
ditches, & on pools on Sheep's 
reen. None on the river save
a large area of rather thin
ice on Newnham mill pool.
General depth of snow
probably 4 1/2 - 5 in., but very
uneven through drifting. Trees
heavily loaded early, but much
of this soon fell off in the sun.

1635
No damage observed. Snow
melted only in the sun, and
probably on the ground from
underneath.
Abundant icicles in the
Old Court, and heavy incrus-
tations around [????]e Garden
House sluice.
Ice formed inside all my
windows, but the plants on
the window-ledge appear un-
hurt. Φ 11
This drying frost has
withered Passiflora and other
evergreens. The frost penetrat-
ing under the arches of
Leckhampton has killed at the
leaves of the two large tub
Amaryllises there.

[11636-11637]
1636
The large and decrepit elm
directly outside the back gate
of King's has a stem flow
from a sawn-off branch some
6 in. dia. about 12ft up the
tree. This continued active in
the frost and the copious
exudate formed a series of
dropping icicles up to c. 2ft
long. Colour of light ale. Φ 15
One or two gulls seen 
over Cambridge.
Little or no road treat-
ment (Saturday) except along
Queens' Road. K.P. and Grange
Road partly cleared themselves:
Sidgwick Av. & Silver Str. very 
bad throughout the day & Selwyn
Gard. almost impassable. [SYMBOL]

Comberton Church.
Icicles about 3 ft long from
water shoots. Φ17
Roof of chancel: ash{????]ed
braced collar, no longitudinal
timbers. Victorian.
Nave roof: Perp., cambered,
very massive principals
with steep camber.
Seats: early Perp. ? Lombardic

Tower floor: very massive
timbers, framed thus.
[DIAG]

Large knots.
Most of the timbers.

[11638-11639]
1638
in this church are of trees
1'6" dia. or more. The 
cambers of the nave principals
make use of natural angles.

Another cloudless day,
temperature hardly reaching
freezing. No skating yet. Ice
again inside windows.
The following route traver-
sed: Selw. G. - Barton Road -
Barton - Comberton - Toft - Hard-
wick - Madingly Road - Coton
- Cambridge.
THere is little snow on the
fields in general, so that the 
plough furrows are everywhere
exposed on the sunward side.
The quantity has doubtless been

1639
reducted by sun & ground
thawing. It is difficult to sup-
pose that much has blown
away because drifts are not
very large.
Drifts are formed by the
N.W. wind. In ditches they
take the form of elegant
curling cornices with much
small-scale detail of ridges
and striations 1/4 in. wide or
less. Φ[????]16. Smaller ditches filled
altogether.
Drifts above ground form
in the lee of cut-down
hedges and especually in the
lee of gaps in fall hedges or
belts. They are long down-
-wind ridges up to c. 20 ft

[11640-11641]
1640
long. Depths exceeding
2 ft between Barton & Camber-
ton, Hardwick & Toft, and on
the Coton turn; greatest
depth less than 3 ft. All 
roads now passable with
little or no difficulty, unlike
Selwyn Gardens and others in
Cambridge.
A wren was seen about
the old elms in [!!!!]Coton back[!!!!]
Toft back lane.
There are some fine old
pollard elms immediately S. of
Comberton church.
Ridge & furrow almost 
due E. & W. in two fields

Madingley Wood.
About half that part 
of the Wood within the Ameri-
can Cemetery is apparently
unaltered. The part nearest
the road, with the adjoining
belt, has been altered by
landscaping, and the N.E.
corner has been encroached 
on by building &c.
There are a few larches
in the E. part of the Wood
in the area shown.
The tree [SYMBOL] is an old
ash in the former belt which
partly collapsed, probably in
the summer gales.
Many rabbit tracks in 
the snow lead under the south

1643
gate, perhaps because there
is now a rabbit-fence E.
of the gate. The gate was
at one time rabbit-proof but
the wire at one end has got
lifted. [SYMBOL]
February 10.
Another nearly cloudless day.
Slight thaw.
February 11.
About 3 in. of heavy com-
pact snow fell in the night
& early morning. A thaw 
set in and it rained for
much of the day. The snow
very slowly melted.
Snow extended to the
outskirts of London, by now
completely covering the fields.

[11644-11645]
1644
There has been snow in the
built-up area but it has
almost all gone.
There are substantial ice
floes on Regent's Canal.
February 12.
The cold brilliant anticyclone
continues. Snow slowly decreases
mainly by evaporation.
February 13.
A slight thaw in the after-
noon. The river is quite high
(submerging part of the Anchor
quay).
Some flooding occurred in
the College Chapel by the holes
in the N. parapet which should 
let the water out getting
blocked with ice. The melting

1645
of the snow on the N. face of
the roof then filled with gutter
with water until it overflowed
down the inside of the wall
under the slates. A similar
flood was just averted on the
roof of the Hall lobby.
February 14.
Slight snowfall in the early 
morning. Another clear day
with slight melting and evap-
oration.
February 15.
A hard night frost with
ice inside the windows.
Snow cover in the Fens
varies but about half the 
fields are more than half
covered. The ditches have

[11646-11647]
1646
snow cornices and the smaller
ones are quite filled. All
shallow water is thickly frozen
but the rivers are clear and
Ely gravel pits have a very thin 
skin.
Snow cover gradually in-
creases eastwards and in Nor-
wich is almost continuous
and about 5 in. deep. A
hard frost continues. No ice
on the Wensum, although
backwaters of the Yare and
moats near Eaton are
frozen over.
No plants in flower (64 H.L.).
About 1 in. of snow fell in 
Norwich in the afternoon,
and more in the early evening.

This is a levelling survey
made at the S. end of
Hayley Ditch where a
start was made on building
an embanked pond.
The present water level in
the Ditch is controlled by a
gap A between the bank and

1649
the boundary bank. The
depth cannot exceed 9 in. This
gap A could be blocked
by a bank to increase the
depth of water by 10 in.
Dam A would then have to 
be extended northward by
heightening Hayley Ditch
bank. When the total height
reached 14 in. the overflow
would be into the boundary
ditch through the low place
B. If a second dam were
made here the two could
he heightened till the water
level was about 30 in. above
the present, which would
flood probably about half
an acre. The limitation

[11650-11651]

[DIAG]

1651
[DIAG]

[11652-11653]
1652
would then be some low
places in the boundary ditch
E. of B.
Work was started on
two dams:
(i) A massive bank across
gap A. The existing vegeta-
tion (privet thicket) was cut 
down and loose silt, leaf-
mould, and twigs removed
as far as possible to get
a good foundation. A line
of stakes was then driven
to be interwoven with hazels
later. This is to be buried
in a clay bank, which was 
carried up c. 4 in. above
present water level.
(ii) A slighter bank was begun

1653
in gap B.
Material mainly dug
from a pit in the area to be
flooded. A little for bank A
was dug locally. The clay
was puddled by treading
or hammering after laying.

Coppicing was finished
and a few of the old ash
stools faced up and thorned.

Heavy snowfall in the
night and on the way to
Hayley Wood. 10.50 - 11.20 a.m.,
at times enough to blot out
the countryside. Total extra
depth c.3 in.
The whole of Hayley is

[11654-11655]
1654
snow-covered. Most of this 
appears to be new snow,
and most of the ground
is covered with ice under
the snow, partly formed by
frozen water and partly
by ve[????]irnt snow. Snow
depth usually c. 3 in.; very
uniform in the Wood but
