Features supplementary to
the points on 2616 - 9.
1a. The boundary bank of the
old wood is remarkably com-
plete, sinuous and massive.  Other
banks define 2 outer enclo-
sures on the E. and minor
encroachment has taken place
on the S.W. and W.
3a.  Over-mature oaks are
remarkable, including some of
the largest in boulder-clay woods.
The 69 in. stump (p.2782) is a
record.  Living oak 126 in. girth.
5. Large coppice more constant
on the E. side. Some giant stools.*
6. Considerable coppicing up
to [!!!!1969] 1970.
7. Prunus Padus occurs through-
*Ash stools up to 8 ft dia.
2793
out the wood including the
E. enclosures. Occurs as large
coppice and scrub in the latter;
small coppice is largely confined
to the old wood.  Collapses
when overgrown;  suckers less
freely than P. spinosa.
12. Still no mercury.
16. Holly includes some huge
trees (p. 2385) the largest in
boulder-clay woods.
18. Well-defined hornbeam
areras, confined to the E. sec-
tions.  Hornbeam occurs as
large coppice only;  some large
stools, including the finest over-
grown hornbeam coppice
known in a boulder-clay
wood (p. 2388).  Probably does

[12794-12795]
2794
not regenerate.
19. Few but very large as-
pens, including over-mature
trees some of them probably
the largest known in boulder
clay woods.
20. Bracken patches are the
only sign of acidification.
21. Little recent planting:
sycamore and beech occasional
in the S.E. corner, few syca-
mores elsewhere.
22. Very free of nettles, ivy,
and other sec. woodland indi-
cators.
2795
"Old wood".
   Topographical and documen-
tary evidence strongly suggest
that it is primary:  it ap-
parently gives its name to the
hundred.  Contains ash stools
of exceptional size.  No horn-
beam.
South-east enclosure.
   Topographically should
be the earliest addition.  Wood
bank nearly as strong as
that of the main wood.  Docu-
mentarily this and the follow-
ing appear to have been in
separate ownerahip.  Vegeta-
tion not significantly distinct
from the old wood.  Ash
stools equally large.  No horn-

[12796-12797]
2796
beam.
East enclosure.
  This should be a later
addition.  Wood-bank strong
to the E., weak to the N.,
which suggests that it might
have run on northwards;
but it is already too long for
a furlong and about 150 yards
further N. is a field hedge
with ancient pollards.
   The hornbeam is confined 
to this part of the wood and
possibly indicates secondary;  but
the stools are very old and
there are in addition ash stools
as large as those in the old
wood.  Other small differences
in vegetation.  If this is secon-
2797
dary woodland it must be
very old.
Other additions.
Those to the S.E., S.W., and
W. are nearly all pre-1838.

alder dominant among
other trees.
  Traces of plateau
alder-wood on the E.

rather open woodland, cop-
piced more recently. [!!!!]
Moderately calcareaous.

  A considerable part of the 
former clearing remains as
an open area to the S.E.
No coppice anywhere in the 
sacred area.
  Probably planted with
larch and spruce about
[!!!!] 40 years ago:  now fine
old trees.  Oak and birch
perhaps natural invasion:
some of these are now
large.  There is a remarkable
stand of giant pure B. pub-
escens at the edge of the

  Line of big beeches nearby: certainly
                        planted.
         Lime.
  All apparently T. cordata.
  The group of stools in 
Bawdeswell Wood, at the 
edge of an acid area,
recalls those at Bradfield.
Stools ancient, low, long un-
coppiced.

       Features.
  For the present state of
the compartments, see G.F.P.'s
map.

1. Size.
2.Remarkable range of soil
types, similar to that at
Bradfield but geographically
less complicated.  Nearly
half acid.  Geological basis
not known.
Dry acid: most of the sacred
Ground and other [!!!!]
areas in the N.E. and middle.
2815
Wet acid stagnant: probably most
of the N.E.
Wet acid flowing: alder
valley.
Dry calcareous: steeper S.W.
slopes.
Wet calcareous stagnant:
much of the S.
3. Excellent wood-banks.
The N.W. and S.E. are the
largest, the N.E. and S.W.
distinctly smaller.  Bawdeswell
Wood has its own wood
bank.
4. Few internal earthworks
apart from ditches.  There
appear to be at least two

[12816-12817]
2816
natural streams.  A geome-
trical grid of ditches of fairly
long standing, mainly not
functional.  The big ditched
rides appear on the 1838
rides:  the other rides and
ditches may be later.  Some
new rides made recently.
The vegetation has probably
not been much affected by
drainage.
5. Typical ancient woodland
structure throughout except
the Sacred Ground.
6. Standards eliminated 
with remarkable thoroughness
(probably in 1921), except in
an area near the S.E. edge.*
7. [!!!!Lime] Ash stools often very large,
*And in Bawdeswell Wood.
2817
especially in calcareous area.
8. Maple abundant and
dominant in the drier cal-
careoous areas.
9, Elm scarce, all glabra,
probably the lowest proportion
of elm in any wood of this
size.
10. Valley alder wood in a
unique combination with
boulder-clay woodland.
11. Traces of plateau alder
wood.
12. Lime present but rare, eco-
logically typical [!!!!for/of] E. Anglia.
13. Sorbus aucuparia: unique
in boulder-clay woods.
14. Several bracken glades.
15. Cherry present.
16. Holly present, loc. ab.
[12818-12819]
2818
17. Attached secondary wood-
land in the Sacred Ground is
rare on acid soil.
18. Lemna trisulca probably 
unique in boulder-clay wood.
19. SPHAGNUM: not known
to be present at Hocking.
20. Little planting until recently.
21. Entirely free of secondary
woodland vegetation except 
Rhododendron.
22. Extreme calcifuges other
than Sphagnum and Rhodo-
dendron are rare.
23. Apparently no Crataegus
oxyacanthoides or Betula verru-
cosa.
24. No boundary pollards.
25. Beech present, but planted.
2819
  Shape, earthworks, structure,
and flora make this certainly
a primary qood. Probably
the N.E. and S.W. wood banks
[!!!!extended to the] are more recent, the wood
originally extending to the
stream & the parish boundary.
  No evidence to support the
"Foxley Park" of the 1838 O.S.
No sign of a laund: the
sacred ground is not one.

The old railways at Themel-
thorpe were mostly at ground
level and much of them has 
been ploughed up.

By P is an earthwork
like the big bank in Little
Wood, but straight.  At the N. end
it is considerably larger than
the wood bank, which is super-
imposed upon it.  Same diffi-
culty about determining whether
it runs on. At the S end
it comes to an abrupt stop
in a pond.

   Boundary in the north-

   Uses of Coppice.
   Lady Hastings says the coppice
was used in the brick kilns
(022312, now derelict).  Some
was used in hurdles (definitely
wovwn).
   Nowadays used for fascines
for stabilizing river banks.  The
coppice is cut under contract.
It is expected that this demand
will soon cease.
   The greater part of the small
coppice in both woods has been
cut within the last 8 years;
none more recently than 3 years.

Dryopteris austriaca

   Scattered in the N. half

groups mixed with oak coppice
or the remains of such.  Never
S. of the waist bank or 
among lime-hazel.
  Not regular and seldom
forming a closed canopy for
more than 6 trees together.
All middle-aged to old
(mainly c. 2' to c. 2'6" dia., a few
down to c. 7"). None appear 
to be over-mature.  Crowns
rather spreading, but more
columnar than oaks. They
were not much hemmed in
when young and have several 
big branches within 20 ft of the
ground, which turn upward and

[12848-12849]

contribute to the crown.  Bark
a remarkable coppery red for
much of the upper and mid-
dle trunk.  Needles rsther

oped shoot).
   Deserves consideration as

Further notes - Great Wood South.
  The area planted with
larch retains some traces 
of its former structure:  ap-
parently oak-over-oak
2851
without  Leucobryum.  Much birch.
Molinia occurs in the N.E.
corner; the only place where
it was seen in the wood.
   On the middle of the E.
side is about 1 acre of tall
old dense pine, presumably 
planted aince it has relict 
oak coppice under.

    Woodland Types.
A. Oak coppice with pine
& Leucobryum.  About 8 acres
in the Great Wood.  Standards
short, very pioneer in habit.
Stool heights very variable 
and a few pollard-like.
Both species of oak mixed
in both layers.  Frequent
[12852 - 12853]
2852
holly.  Only other vascular
plant is bracken.  Soil dry,
very acid, somewhat podsolized,
boundary sharp, but a few
outlying patches and scattered
tufts of Leucobryum.
   Presence of sparse bracken
suggests this may be secon-
dary woodland on the site
of a big glade, the bracken 
being the remnant of a 
denser stand reduced by
shade and podsolization;  but
some of the oak stools are
huge.
   Oak population probably
unevenaged;  pine may be
evenaged.
2853
B. Oak coppice with bracken,
brambles and no Leucobryum.
Differs from above in (i) stools
much less dense (but stan-
dards no less dense) (ii) dense
ground vegetation (iii) 
much longer neglected, (iiii) no
Leucobryum.  Wet, mainly stag-
nant, very acid, less pod-
solized.  Pines less frequent,
except for planted stands.
   Difference from A is
probably mainly edaphic rsther
thn historical.
Sphagnum is in this type.

C. Acid 2-3-layered wood-
land.  Oak standards (both
spp. occasionally other trees).

[12854-12855]
2854
Coppice mainly of lime, hazel,
and birch, lime the most abun-
dant.  Usually 2 co-dominants
but sometimes one only.  Ash
&  maple local.  Less strongly
acid, less podsolized.  Dry to
moderately wet, stagnant.
Typical "light" coppice-wood.
   Boundary with B is
well-defined: narrow transi-
tion zone suggesting retreat
of B.  Difference perhaps 

Bracken ioccurs in C in
glades and other open places.
Ground vegetation otherwise
mainly brambles.

D. Neutral to calcareous
2855
mixed coppice with alder.  Most
of Little Wood apart from the
bracken area.  Dominant ash,
hazel, birches.  Sallow freqwuent.
Crab, maple rare.  Alder
rather frequent, constant.
   Stagnant wet.
   The best example of
plateau alder after the 
Bradfields;  but alder forms
a much smaller proportion here.
   Remarkable difference
between the two woods.  The
bracken areas of Little are
perhaps the best regarded as
modified [!!!!] C.  No typical D
occurs in Great, although
in the S.W. and NW. there 
are calcareous areas with a

[12856-12857]
2856
high ash[SYMBOL]lime ratio.

E. Alder - Prunus padus coppice.
Often 1-layered but some-
times with associatd ash
LC and/or Prunus or hazel
SC.  Very wet stagnant or
slightly flowing, calcareous.
Small areas in both woods.
   Apparently unique.
   
      Tilia cordata.
   The commonest coppice
tree in Great Wood, unknown
in Little Wood.
Occurs schiefly as LC;
other coppice.  Stools unlike
those in any other wood,
2857
high, rather small diameter in
most cases.  Two rather low
boundary pollards (p. 2827).
also no hedge semi-pollards
(p. 2828 - 9).
  Stand of lime is probably 
uneven-aged;  no young
plants.  No standards.
      Prunus padus.
  Gregarious;  small patches in
wet calcareous parts of both
woods, associated with alder.
Mainly LC; stools sometimes 
huge ([SYMBOL] 27), always low.  Also
occurs as SC.  Probably regen-
erates by seed as well as
sparsely rhizomatous.
The semi-pollard (p. 2835) is
probably unique.

[12858-12859]
2858
          Alder.
   Distribution similar to Prunus
padus.  Mainly LC;  some SC
and shrubs.  Scattered thro'
the Little Wood. Occurs as
one standard (Great Wood) and
hedge semi-pollards (p. 2828 - 9).
Probably uneven-aged, re-
producing by seed.
       Rowan.
   Scattered through the
old wood as small coppice
and very occasionally large.
Stools all small.
      Leucobryum.
   Tussocks ([SYMBOL] 33, 34) to
c. 1 ft. dia., often breaking up,
with other bryophytes (p. 2839) often
2859
covering a large part of the
surfaces.
