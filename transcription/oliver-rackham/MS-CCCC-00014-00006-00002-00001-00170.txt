February 23.
    Wayland Wood.

the E. and S.W. sides were
explored:  G.F.P.did the

storey including a few very

large ash stools and one or
two hornbeams.

[12792-12793]

Features supplementary to
the points on 2616 - 9.
1a. The boundary bank of the
old wood is remarkably com-
plete, sinuous and massive.  Other
banks define 2 outer enclo-
sures on the E. and minor
encroachment has taken place
on the S.W. and W.
3a.  Over-mature oaks are
remarkable, including some of
the largest in boulder-clay woods.
The 69 in. stump (p.2782) is a
record.  Living oak 126 in. girth.
5. Large coppice more constant
on the E. side. Some giant stools.*
6. Considerable coppicing up
to [!!!!1969] 1970.
7. Prunus Padus occurs through-
*Ash stools up to 8 ft dia.
2793
out the wood including the
E. enclosures. Occurs as large
coppice and scrub in the latter;
small coppice is largely confined
to the old wood.  Collapses
when overgrown;  suckers less
freely than P. spinosa.
12. Still no mercury.
16. Holly includes some huge
trees (p. 2385) the largest in
boulder-clay woods.
18. Well-defined hornbeam
areras, confined to the E. sec-
tions.  Hornbeam occurs as
large coppice only;  some large
stools, including the finest over-
grown hornbeam coppice
known in a boulder-clay
wood (p. 2388).  Probably does

[12794-12795]
2794
not regenerate.
19. Few but very large as-
pens, including over-mature
trees some of them probably
the largest known in boulder
clay woods.
20. Bracken patches are the
only sign of acidification.
21. Little recent planting:
sycamore and beech occasional
in the S.E. corner, few syca-
mores elsewhere.
22. Very free of nettles, ivy,
and other sec. woodland indi-
cators.
2795
"Old wood".
   Topographical and documen-
tary evidence strongly suggest
that it is primary:  it ap-
parently gives its name to the
hundred.  Contains ash stools
of exceptional size.  No horn-
beam.
South-east enclosure.
   Topographically should
be the earliest addition.  Wood
bank nearly as strong as
that of the main wood.  Docu-
mentarily this and the follow-
ing appear to have been in
separate ownerahip.  Vegeta-
tion not significantly distinct
from the old wood.  Ash
stools equally large.  No horn-

[12796-12797]
2796
beam.
East enclosure.
  This should be a later
addition.  Wood-bank strong
to the E., weak to the N.,
which suggests that it might
have run on northwards;
but it is already too long for
a furlong and about 150 yards
further N. is a field hedge
with ancient pollards.
   The hornbeam is confined 
to this part of the wood and
possibly indicates secondary;  but
the stools are very old and
there are in addition ash stools
as large as those in the old
wood.  Other small differences
in vegetation.  If this is secon-
2797
dary woodland it must be
very old.
Other additions.
Those to the S.E., S.W., and
W. are nearly all pre-1838.

exists as a low hedge for
most of its length.

        Alder
  Two [!!!!] types of alder
wood, quite distinct.
  Valley alder-wood, in a 
region of abundant springs.
Fed by acid water but not
extremely acid.  Large coppice
alder dominant among
other trees.
  Traces of plateau
alder-wood on the E.
margin.  Very few stools in
rather open woodland, cop-
piced more recently. [!!!!]
Moderately calcareaous.
  No standard alder anywhere.
     Sacred Ground.
  Said to be differently
owned from the rest of the

[12810-12811]
[DIAG]

[12812-12813]
2812
wood and not leased to the 
F.C.  Not clear what gods it
is sacred to.
  A considerable part of the 
former clearing remains as
an open area to the S.E.
No coppice anywhere in the 
sacred area.
  Probably planted with
larch and spruce about
[!!!!] 40 years ago:  now fine
old trees.  Oak and birch
perhaps natural invasion:
some of these are now
large.  There is a remarkable
stand of giant pure B. pub-
escens at the edge of the 
temenes:  [SYMBOL] 18
  Understorey sparse: chiefly
2813
Rhododendron and holly ([SYMBOL]
18.)
  A strongly acid area but
without lime.  Surrounding 
ditches swampy and said to
contain Sphagnum.  Sacred area
itself is rather dry.
  Line of big beeches nearby: certainly
                        planted.
         Lime.
  All apparently T. cordata.
  The group of stools in 
Bawdeswell Wood, at the 
edge of an acid area,
recalls those at Bradfield.
Stools ancient, low, long un-
coppiced.
  There is a single lime
stool on the wood-bank of
Foxley very close to the Foxley
  
[12814-12815]
2814
-Bawdeswell-Hackford triple
point.  About 3ft x 1/2ft.
Coppiced more recently.
       Features.
  For the present state of
the compartments, see G.F.P.'s
map.

1. Size.
2.Remarkable range of soil
types, similar to that at
Bradfield but geographically
less complicated.  Nearly
half acid.  Geological basis
not known.
Dry acid: most of the sacred
Ground and other [!!!!]
areas in the N.E. and middle.
2815
Wet acid stagnant: probably most
of the N.E.
Wet acid flowing: alder
valley.
Dry calcareous: steeper S.W.
slopes.
Wet calcareous stagnant:
much of the S.
3. Excellent wood-banks.
The N.W. and S.E. are the
largest, the N.E. and S.W.
distinctly smaller.  Bawdeswell
Wood has its own wood
bank.
4. Few internal earthworks
apart from ditches.  There
appear to be at least two

[12816-12817]
2816
natural streams.  A geome-
trical grid of ditches of fairly
long standing, mainly not
functional.  The big ditched
rides appear on the 1838
rides:  the other rides and
ditches may be later.  Some
new rides made recently.
The vegetation has probably
not been much affected by
drainage.
5. Typical ancient woodland
structure throughout except
the Sacred Ground.
6. Standards eliminated 
with remarkable thoroughness
(probably in 1921), except in
an area near the S.E. edge.*
7. [!!!!Lime] Ash stools often very large,
*And in Bawdeswell Wood.
2817
especially in calcareous area.
8. Maple abundant and
dominant in the drier cal-
careoous areas.
9, Elm scarce, all glabra,
probably the lowest proportion
of elm in any wood of this
size.
10. Valley alder wood in a
unique combination with
boulder-clay woodland.
11. Traces of plateau alder
wood.
12. Lime present but rare, eco-
logically typical [!!!!for/of] E. Anglia.
13. Sorbus aucuparia: unique
in boulder-clay woods.
14. Several bracken glades.
15. Cherry present.
16. Holly present, loc. ab.
[12818-12819]
2818
17. Attached secondary wood-
land in the Sacred Ground is
rare on acid soil.
18. Lemna trisulca probably 
unique in boulder-clay wood.
19. SPHAGNUM: not known
to be present at Hocking.
20. Little planting until recently.
21. Entirely free of secondary
woodland vegetation except 
Rhododendron.
22. Extreme calcifuges other
than Sphagnum and Rhodo-
dendron are rare.
23. Apparently no Crataegus
oxyacanthoides or Betula verru-
cosa.
24. No boundary pollards.
25. Beech present, but planted.
2819
  Shape, earthworks, structure,
and flora make this certainly
a primary qood. Probably
the N.E. and S.W. wood banks
[!!!!extended to the] are more recent, the wood
originally extending to the
stream & the parish boundary.
  No evidence to support the
"Foxley Park" of the 1838 O.S.
No sign of a laund: the
sacred ground is not one.

The old railways at Themel-
thorpe were mostly at ground
level and much of them has 
been ploughed up.
  Haw Wood (Kerdiston) ap-
parently intact.
 Hindolveston Wood Much
