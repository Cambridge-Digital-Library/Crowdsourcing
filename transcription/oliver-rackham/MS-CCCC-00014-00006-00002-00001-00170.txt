February 23.
    Wayland Wood.
   With G.F. Peterken.  Mainly
the E. and S.W. sides were
explored:  G.F.P.did the
W. side.
   A notably dry wood
without standing water.

   Some sporadic cutting of
small coppice has gone on both
here and in the E. part of 
the "old wood".  No felling
of large timber.  Some coppice
cut this winter.

storey including a few very
2791
large ash stools and one or
two hornbeams.

Features supplementary to
the points on 2616 - 9.
1a. The boundary bank of the
old wood is remarkably com-
plete, sinuous and massive.  Other
banks define 2 outer enclo-
sures on the E. and minor
encroachment has taken place
on the S.W. and W.
3a.  Over-mature oaks are
remarkable, including some of
the largest in boulder-clay woods.
The 69 in. stump (p.2782) is a
record.  Living oak 126 in. girth.
5. Large coppice more constant
on the E. side. Some giant stools.*
6. Considerable coppicing up
to [!!!!1969] 1970.
7. Prunus Padus occurs through-
*Ash stools up to 8 ft dia.
2793
out the wood including the
E. enclosures. Occurs as large
coppice and scrub in the latter;
small coppice is largely confined
to the old wood.  Collapses
when overgrown;  suckers less
freely than P. spinosa.
12. Still no mercury.
16. Holly includes some huge
trees (p. 2385) the largest in
boulder-clay woods.
18. Well-defined hornbeam
areras, confined to the E. sec-
tions.  Hornbeam occurs as
large coppice only;  some large
stools, including the finest over-
grown hornbeam coppice
known in a boulder-clay
wood (p. 2388).  Probably does

[12794-12795]
2794
not regenerate.
19. Few but very large as-
pens, including over-mature
trees some of them probably
the largest known in boulder
clay woods.
20. Bracken patches are the
only sign of acidification.
21. Little recent planting:
sycamore and beech occasional
in the S.E. corner, few syca-
mores elsewhere.
22. Very free of nettles, ivy,
and other sec. woodland indi-
cators.
2795
"Old wood".
   Topographical and documen-
tary evidence strongly suggest
that it is primary:  it ap-
parently gives its name to the
hundred.  Contains ash stools
of exceptional size.  No horn-
beam.
South-east enclosure.
   Topographically should
be the earliest addition.  Wood
bank nearly as strong as
that of the main wood.  Docu-
mentarily this and the follow-
ing appear to have been in
separate ownerahip.  Vegeta-
tion not significantly distinct
from the old wood.  Ash
stools equally large.  No horn-

[12796-12797]
2796
beam.
East enclosure.
  This should be a later
addition.  Wood-bank strong
to the E., weak to the N.,
which suggests that it might
have run on northwards;
but it is already too long for
a furlong and about 150 yards
further N. is a field hedge
with ancient pollards.
   The hornbeam is confined 
to this part of the wood and
possibly indicates secondary;  but
the stools are very old and
there are in addition ash stools
as large as those in the old
wood.  Other small differences
in vegetation.  If this is secon-
2797
dary woodland it must be
very old.
Other additions.
Those to the S.E., S.W., and
W. are nearly all pre-1838.

Very acid and perhaps secondary.

Few stool oaks.
  Standards appear to have
been felled from this area
many years ago.  Much of
this woodland has been poi-
soned.  Rapid transition to the 
S.W. to mercury woodland.

  Directly alongside the road.
Note than the wood-bank on

  The parish hedge parallel 
to the N.E. margin of the wood
exists as a low hedge for
most of its length.

        Alder
  Two [!!!!] types of alder
wood, quite distinct.
  Valley alder-wood, in a 
region of abundant springs.
Fed by acid water but not
extremely acid.  Large coppice
alder dominant among
other trees.
  Traces of plateau
alder-wood on the E.
margin.  Very few stools in
rather open woodland, cop-
piced more recently. [!!!!]
Moderately calcareaous.
  No standard alder anywhere.
     Sacred Ground.
  Said to be differently
owned from the rest of the

[DIAG]

[12812-12813]
2812
wood and not leased to the 
F.C.  Not clear what gods it
is sacred to.
  A considerable part of the 
former clearing remains as
an open area to the S.E.
No coppice anywhere in rhe 
sacred area.
  Probably planted with
larch and spruce about
[!!!!] 40 years ago:  now fine
old trees.  Oak and birch
perhaps natural invasion:
some of these are now
large.  There is a remarkable
stand of giant pure B. pub-
escens at the edge of the 
temenes:  [SYMBOL] 18
  Understorey sparse: chiefly
2813
Rhododendron and holly ([SYMBOL]
18.)
  A strongly acid area but
without lime.  Surrounding 
ditches swampy and said to
contain Sphagnum.  Sacred area
itself is rather dry.
  Line of big beeches nearby: certainly
                        planted.
         Lime.
  All apparently T. cordata.
  The group of stools in 
Bawdeswell Wood, at the 
edge of an acid area,
recalls those at Bradfield.
Stools ancient, low, long un-
coppiced.
  There is a single lime
stool on the wood-bank of
Foxley very close to the Foxley
