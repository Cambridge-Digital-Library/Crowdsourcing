  The woods on Houndkirk
Moor are pine, beech, sycamore,
with large patches of birch, and
oak in places.  Probably origin-
ate from plantations but
have extended onto the moor.
Very wind-pruned in places.
Many trees (esp. oak &
sycamore) with pioneer habit.
Little undergrowth, mainly
Rhododendron ponticum.  Ground
veg. mainly grasses.  Tree
trunks blackened.
  Hawthorns occur as patches
of scrub in gulleys, and isolated
trees on the moor.
  Lichens occur on rocks
at the Grouse Inn (PH above
Nether Padley).

  Some of the plantations
are dying and occasionally
reduced to Rhododendron
bushes.
  Below Froggate Edge is a
notable litter of mossy boulders
up to car size in a syca-
more wood.
  The cliff of Curbar Edge is
composed of smooth cubical
blocks up to c. 30 ft high,
made by strong horizontal
bedding & vertical cracks.
  The Derwent at Froggatt
is lined on either side with a
beautiful row of large alders,
rather regularly spaced at
the same height above the 
water, and probably once
coppiced.

  S.E. of the Calver-Froggatt
bridge is a tract of alluvial
land planted with alder & pop-
lar.  It is traversed with
"ridge & furrow" like the drain-
age channels on water mead-
dows.
  Pleurococcus appears on
trees at Stoney Middleton.
  At Stoney Middleton several
houses back directly onto the
precipice forming the N. side of
the dale.
   Mercury abruptly replaces
most of the ivy c. 100 yards
up Eyam Dale.
  At the W. end of Eyam there
are numerous strip-fields
enclosed with stone walls.
