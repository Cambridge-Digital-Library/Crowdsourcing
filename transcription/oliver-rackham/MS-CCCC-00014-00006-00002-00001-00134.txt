  The woods on Houndkirk
Moor are pine, beech, sycamore,
with large patches of birch, and
oak in places.  Probably origin-
ate from plantations but
have extended onto the moor.
Very wind-pruned in places.
Many trees (esp. oak &
sycamore) with pioneer habit.
Little undergrowth, mainly
Rhododendron ponticum.  Ground
veg. mainly grasses.  Tree
trunks blackened.
  Hawthorns occur as patches
of scrub in gulleys, and isolated
trees on the moor.
  Lichens occur on rocks
at the Grouse Inn (PH above
Nether Padley).
[10190-10191]

  Some of the plantations
are dying and occasionally
reduced to Rhododendron
bushes.
  Below Froggate Edge is a
notable litter of mossy boulders
up to car size in a syca-
more wood.
  The cliff of Curbar Edge is
composed of smooth cubical
blocks up to c. 30 ft high,
made by strong horizontal
bedding & vertical cracks.
  The Derwent at Froggatt
is lined on either side with a
beautiful row of large alders,
rather regularly spaced at
the same height above the 
water, and probably once
coppiced.
191
  S.E. of the Calver-Froggatt
bridge is a tract of alluvial
land planted with alder & pop-
lar.  It is traversed with
"ridge & furrow" like the drain-
age channels on water mead-
dows.
  Pleurococcus appears on
trees at Stoney Middleton.
  At Stoney Middleton several
houses back directly onto the
precipice forming the N. side of
the dale.
   Mercury abruptly replaces
most of the ivy c. 100 yards
up Eyam Dale.
  At the W. end of Eyam there
are numerous strip-fields
enclosed with stone walls.

Screes in Cressbrookdale
Completely lichened
(crustose) but bryophytes and
higher plants few.
*Neckera 109
Camptothecium lutecscens
Sycamore & ash trees few
and scattered.
These screes are at
176754, on the S. side of the
head of rhe dale near Peter's
Stone.  Prof. Pigott says they
have become unstable in
recent years thrugh children
playing.  There is a sma;l
stable cliff above CP 27.
195
Woods in Cressbrookdale.
  Ash dominant in places, esp-
ecially on the less accessible E.
side.  Never large.  Usually 1-
trunked though some may have
           been once cut.
Maple
frequent in places but never
any large part of the wood.
Hazel generally abundant.
Regularly coppiced only near
Ravensdale.
Alder frequent in the more
marshy parts of the woods
but never abundant.
U. glabra apparently yhe only
elm.  Locally dom. mainmly on the
W. side.  Occasionally cut.
[10196-10197]
196
Hawthorn abundant as an
understorey, particularly where
the wood appears to have
encroached on grass clearings.
Birch frequent and generally
distributed, but never a large
part of the wood.
Aspen scattered
Desch caespit usually domin-ant, especially un der ash.
Vicia saepium freq.
Allium ursinum.  abundant 
near Ravensdale, locally dominant
under elm.
197
Mercury abundant but
seldom dominant.
Ranunc. rep sometimes domin-
ant in water.
Carex sylv. abundant
Beech frequent around Ravens-
dale.

Ivy generally rare mainly on cliffs
Yew.  Rare: several old trees
high up on the cliff face of Hay
Top;  two trees in the wood at
Creasbrook.  Not otherwise.

ently of limestone debris.  Prof.
Pigott says that the ash trees
rot and fall over on reaching 
medium size.  Daphne Meze-
reon is said to occur.
  Regeneration is generally
poor throughout these woods,
even on the E. side.

Lead rakes run in roughly
straight lines across the
valley.  They appear as
rows of shallow excavations
and grass-grown hummocks
of spoil heaps.  They repre-
sent igneous intrusions
of "toad-stone". One in Tans-

was made to count plants.
There is seldom any diffi-
culty in deciding what is an 
infl.
  Leaf damage consists of 
the cutting off and disap-
pearance of the end of the
leaf:  usually the tip only
in mature leaves, often
half or more of the leaf if
young.  Occurs in a high
proportion of the plants with
infl. damage in plot 1., a 
smaller proportion in plot 3
and not seen at all in plot 2.
Never seen in plants with
infls standing and probably
never in sterile plants.  On the
deer hypothesis it results
from the animal biting the
211
tips of the leaves, or in 
some cases the whole middle 
of the rosette, in one mouth-
ful with the infl.

display & improved corner post.
[DIAG] 36: plot 2, showing good
display.
[DIAG] 37: plant in plot 1, showng
2 scapes nipt off and modeate
leaf damage.
  The scape can be cut
off anywhere from just below
the umbel almost to to the
base,  Damaged plnnts in the
fenced plot are all amputated 
high.
Single-flower damage is
frequent in plot 3, but was
not seen elsewhere.  Infls

[10212-10213]
212
are recorded in all cases
according to the state of the
most advanced surviving flower.
  Deer footmarks are infre-
quent in Plot 1 and were 
not seen in 2 or 3.  The
ground is rather hard and
does not easily impress.
The evidence of deer ac-
tivity in 1 is good, notably
the corner post damage.
  The display of oxlips in
the wood as a whole is
better thsn last year.  The
damage of Plot 1 is repre-
sentative of much of that
part of the wood, though 
some areas have less dam-
age. The display is the 
fenced plot is much better
313
than in any surrounding area,
and is as good as anywhere
in that part of the wood.
  Oxlips do comparatively
well in the coppice plots,
notably 1964-5.  The number
of infls is greater than in
the undisturbed wood, and
the brambles and other 
vegetstion appear to protect.
