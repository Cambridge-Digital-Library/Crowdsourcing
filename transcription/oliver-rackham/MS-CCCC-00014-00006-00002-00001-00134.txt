  The woods on Houndkirk
Moor are pine, beech, sycamore,
with large patches of birch, and
oak in places.  Probably origin-
ate from plantations but
have extended onto the moor.
Very wind-pruned in places.
Many trees (esp. oak &
sycamore) with pioneer habit.
Little undergrowth, mainly
Rhododendron ponticum.  Ground
veg. mainly grasses.  Tree
trunks blackened.
  Hawthorns occur as patches
of scrub in gulleys, and isolated
trees on the moor.
  Lichens occur on rocks
at the Grouse Inn (PH above
Nether Padley).
[10190-10191]

  Some of the plantations
are dying and occasionally
reduced to Rhododendron
bushes.
  Below Froggate Edge is a
notable litter of mossy boulders
up to car size in a syca-
more wood.
  The cliff of Curbar Edge is
composed of smooth cubical
blocks up to c. 30 ft high,
made by strong horizontal
bedding & vertical cracks.
  The Derwent at Froggatt
is lined on either side with a
beautiful row of large alders,
rather regularly spaced at
the same height above the 
water, and probably once
coppiced.
191
  S.E. of the Calver-Froggatt
bridge is a tract of alluvial
land planted with alder & pop-
lar.  It is traversed with
"ridge & furrow" like the drain-
age channels on water mead-
dows.
  Pleurococcus appears on
trees at Stoney Middleton.
  At Stoney Middleton several
houses back directly onto the
precipice forming the N. side of
the dale.
   Mercury abruptly replaces
most of the ivy c. 100 yards
up Eyam Dale.
  At the W. end of Eyam there
are numerous strip-fields
enclosed with stone walls.

N. side of Tansleydale
Limestone grassland, steep
S. facing slope
Zerna erecta
Plantago lane
Thymus
Helianthemum
Festuca ovina
Orchis fuchleon?
Astragalus
Lotus
Carex flacca
*Cledonia cf pocillum 103
*Erophila rock outcrops
Tansleydale is a deep
narrow dry valley, permanent
grass grazed by sheep. On the
N. side there are outcrops 
of quartzite and other rocks
and mine heaps.
193
S. side
much longer turf
still F. ovina, poor in
spp
Black slurry soil
Plagiochila aspl.
humus Cladonia
Campanula rotun
Carex flacca
Senecio jacob.
Cirsium cf hetero cp
*Rhacomitrium   105
*Reboulia on outcrops 106
Ctenidium stones* 
Sorediate Cladonia humus 107
  This side closely resem-
bles Winnats in soil, but
has less rich flora and 
lacks the icicles.

[10194-10195]

* branched Cladonia floor 108



Screes in Cressbrookdale
Completely lichened
(crustose) but bryophytes and
higher plants few.
*Neckera 109
Camptothecium lutecscens
Sycamore & ash trees few
and scattered.
These screes are at
176754, on the S. side of the
head of rhe dale near Peter's
Stone.  Prof. Pigott says they
have become unstable in
recent years thrugh children
playing.  There is a sma;l
stable cliff above CP 27.
195
Woods in Cressbrookdale.
  Ash dominant in places, esp-
ecially on the less accessible E.
side.  Never large.  Usually 1-
trunked though some may have
           been once cut.
Maple
frequent in places but never
any large part of the wood.
Hazel generally abundant.
Regularly coppiced only near
Ravensdale.
Alder frequent in the more
marshy parts of the woods
but never abundant.
U. glabra apparently yhe only
elm.  Locally dom. mainmly on the
W. side.  Occasionally cut.
