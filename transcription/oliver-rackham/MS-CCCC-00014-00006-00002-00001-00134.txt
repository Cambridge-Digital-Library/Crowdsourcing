  The woods on Houndkirk
Moor are pine, beech, sycamore,
with large patches of birch, and
oak in places.  Probably origin-
ate from plantations but
have extended onto the moor.
Very wind-pruned in places.
Many trees (esp. oak &
sycamore) with pioneer habit.
Little undergrowth, mainly
Rhododendron ponticum.  Ground
veg. mainly grasses.  Tree
trunks blackened.
  Hawthorns occur as patches
of scrub in gulleys, and isolated
trees on the moor.
  Lichens occur on rocks
at the Grouse Inn (PH above
Nether Padley).
[10190-10191]

  Some of the plantations
are dying and occasionally
reduced to Rhododendron
bushes.
  Below Froggate Edge is a
notable litter of mossy boulders
up to car size in a syca-
more wood.
  The cliff of Curbar Edge is
composed of smooth cubical
blocks up to c. 30 ft high,
made by strong horizontal
bedding & vertical cracks.
  The Derwent at Froggatt
is lined on either side with a
beautiful row of large alders,
rather regularly spaced at
the same height above the 
water, and probably once
coppiced.
191
  S.E. of the Calver-Froggatt
bridge is a tract of alluvial
land planted with alder & pop-
lar.  It is traversed with
"ridge & furrow" like the drain-
age channels on water mead-
dows.
  Pleurococcus appears on
trees at Stoney Middleton.
  At Stoney Middleton several
houses back directly onto the
precipice forming the N. side of
the dale.
   Mercury abruptly replaces
most of the ivy c. 100 yards
up Eyam Dale.
  At the W. end of Eyam there
are numerous strip-fields
enclosed with stone walls.

Camptothecium lutecscens
Sycamore & ash trees few

These screes are at
176754, on the S. side of the
head of rhe dale near Peter's
Stone.  Prof. Pigott says they
have become unstable in
recent years thrugh children
playing.  There is a sma;l
stable cliff above CP 27.

Woods in Cressbrookdale.
  Ash dominant in places, esp-
ecially on the less accessible E.
side.  Never large.  Usually 1-
trunked though some may have
           been once cut.
Maple
frequent in places but never
any large part of the wood.
Hazel generally abundant.
Regularly coppiced only near
Ravensdale.
Alder frequent in the more
marshy parts of the woods
but never abundant.
U. glabra apparently yhe only

W. side.  Occasionally cut.
[10196-10197]

Hawthorn abundant as an
understorey, particularly where
the wood appears to have
encroached on grass clearings.
Birch frequent and generally
distributed, but never a large

dale.

Pigott says that the ash trees

  Regeneration is generally
poor throughout these woods,
even on the E. side.

Lead rakes run in roughly
straight lines across the
valley.  They appear as
rows of shallow excavations

was made to count plants.
There is seldom any diffi-
culty in deciding what is an 
infl.
  Leaf damage consists of 
the cutting off and disap-
pearance of the end of the
leaf:  usually the tip only
in mature leaves, often
half or more of the leaf if
young.  Occurs in a high
proportion of the plants with
infl. damage in plot 1., a 
smaller proportion in plot 3
and not seen at all in plot 2.
Never seen in plants with
infls standing and probably
never in sterile plants.  On the
deer hypothesis it results
from the animal biting the
211
tips of the leaves, or in 
some cases the whole middle 
of the rosette, in one mouth-
ful with the infl.

leaf damage.
  The scape can be cut
off anywhere from just below
the umbel almost to to the
base,  Damaged plnnts in the
fenced plot are all amputated 
high.
Single-flower damage is
frequent in plot 3, but was
not seen elsewhere.  Infls

[10212-10213]
212
are recorded in all cases
according to the state of the
most advanced surviving flower.
  Deer footmarks are infre-
quent in Plot 1 and were 
not seen in 2 or 3.  The
ground is rather hard and
does not easily impress.
The evidence of deer ac-
tivity in 1 is good, notably
the corner post damage.
  The display of oxlips in
the wood as a whole is
better thsn last year.  The
damage of Plot 1 is repre-
sentative of much of that
part of the wood, though 
some areas have less dam-
age. The display is the 
fenced plot is much better
313
than in any surrounding area,
and is as good as anywhere
in that part of the wood.
  Oxlips do comparatively
well in the coppice plots,
notably 1964-5.  The number
of infls is greater than in
the undisturbed wood, and
the brambles and other 
vegetstion appear to protect.

  The great beech near
the S.W. corner has broken
off in a spectacular manner;
apparently in a N.W. gale.
The trunk has split longi-
tudinally and part of the
butt with roots has been
raised some 20 ft into the
air.  Collapse must be due
to old injury and disease.
  Poplar is rare in this
wood except in the N. of the
old wood.
  Damage to oxlips is
rare and localized.  No leaf
damage seen.
  Oxlipa occur usually in 
sparse stands with a high
proportion of flowering indivi-
duals.  Plants generally smaller
233
than at Hayley.  Juxtaposition
of oxlips & mercury, and occa-
sional mosaics, are frequent.
  Only standing water seen
was a very little at the bottom
of the pond.
The lower degrees of popu-
lation mixture in Primulas
usually involve the existence
of a proportion of plants 
with a few primrose charac-
ters among othwrwise appar-
ently pure oxlips.  "Pure"
primroses do not appear until 
the proportion of hybrids is
high.
  Primulas are quite absent
from Manor Close except the 
S.W. and S.E. corners  and a few
primroses along the E. side.

  A few standing oaks are in

  There are apparently no

   Primula hybrids are strik-
ingly confined to certain plots.
Much of te Primula area
seems to have been lost in the 
N.E.
  There are a few old oak
pollards on the S.E. margin.
  Elms are strictly local-
ized.  This is a poorly suck-
ering elm of low invasive
power.  Many of rhe elms
245
particularly in the BP area
are of coppice origin.
  By the pond on the N.E.
is a very large formerly
pollarded Salix fragilis, the
only one seen in the wood.
  Birch (probably all B.
pendula) is abundant in
certain areas, notably the 
scrub along CG and Saw-
pit - Gap Wood.
  The scrub is typically 
Salix (mainly cinerea)
and birch;  Prunus does not 
predominate.

off short near the base, but
even if the stump is over-
tipped by leaves none of the
latter were damaged.

was eaetn off through the

   Much damage to individual
flowers, apparently through
nipping of the corolla in a
