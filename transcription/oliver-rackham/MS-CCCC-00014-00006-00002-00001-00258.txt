Section across Thisbe plain.
Sloping alluvial land on both
sides of plain is olive groves.
On the S. side these are clearly 
laid out in strips, some of which 
are curved.
Olives end fairly abruptly
on the flat ground (old lake 
bed? - see Paucanias) of the
bottom of the plain.
[19938-19939]
9938
Abandoned Terraces (B)
In shallow gulley in
rock slope next to maquis
previously described.
   Terraces of big stones, some
walls still standing. Area is sep-
arated from maquis by remains
of a wall of big stones. Evi-
dently not maintained for
at least some decades.
   Cultivsted land still has
little perennial vegetation.
Woody plants chiefly in rems
of walls & tumbles of scree.
Prickly oak v. ab. up to c.
8 ft high.
Phlomis frut. v. ab., big bushes
some leggy ones c. 6 ft high.
9939
Much Phlomis on the adjoining
hillside is dying bsck, prob.
through age.
   Higher up the slope the vegeta-
tion becomes sparser & more
grazed. Less maquis. Less
oak. [!!!!& more pear]. A sp. of
Rhamnus becomes ab.  (C).
Occ Poterium spinosum (rare
in Thisbe area).
Selaginella becomes ab.

Lowest Pines in spur of Mt
Helicon.   D
Scattered trees to  c. 15 ft high
and c. 6" thick. Often bushy
& forked at base. Many
much eaten down but
some growing up.
[19940-19941]

Terrain is S.E. facing c. 20Â°
30% base limestone. Well-de-
veloped terra rossa.
Maquis 30% of total cover.

Oak severely grazed to c. 2 ft
high, no leaders forming.

Hillside is a mosaic of oak 
& olive - dominated maquis was
Further up hill, by an aban
9941
doned farm. Pines become
denser (c. 50% canopy). None
much bigger, save asfew  old
pines (? 1 - 1 1/2 ft dia) in rather
inaccessible places in cliffs.

Small patch of Spartium
Calycotome - dom. scree just
above fsrm.

Apparently some abandonment
of arable in small plain to
E. of this hill.

Big tortoise - 10" x 5 1/.2 " -
concave underside, hooked beak  
Small amount of Juniperus
phoen in broken rocky spur.
[19942-19943]

   Occasional pines extend in
olive-groves down to 300 m.

Rems of lime-burning pit

Apius Nikolaos is a beautiful 
and hitherto lonely bay surrounded
by high rugged cliffs, mainly hard
limestone, with areas of metamor-
phic rocks. Reached hitherto by
a very narrow road over the moun-
tains. A tiny, probably old, farm
and cafe use the only build-
ingd. Recently a new road, still
unfinished has been blasted in
zigzags through the cliffs.
   Natural vegetation of steep,
mainly S. to S.E. facing slopes.
Much bare rock; what is vege-
tated is largely maquis, with
9947
little garrigue. Juniperus phoe-
nicea and olive sre codom-
inant; at higher altitudes mainly
Prickly-oak present but not 
abundant.  Euphorbia dendroides
(summer-deciduus) freq. on
rocks. Rock is much broken,
with deep fissures and veins
of terra rossa.
  These slopes are rather
little grazed; bushes mostly c.
6-8 ft high snd growing rapidly.
Someqhat columnar habit sug-
gesting recovery from more se-
vere grezing.
   Most of the olives have at
least their upper leaves of the
lanceolate cultivsted kind.
The trunks are usually multiple
