Section across Thisbe plain.
Sloping alluvial land on both
sides of plain is olive groves.
On the S. side these are clearly 
laid out in strips, some of which 
are curved.
Olives end fairly abruptly
on the flat ground (old lake 
bed? - see Paucanias) of the
bottom of the plain.
[19938-19939]
9938
Abandoned Terraces (B)
In shallow gulley in
rock slope next to maquis
previously described.
   Terraces of big stones, some
walls still standing. Area is sep-
arated from maquis by remains
of a wall of big stones. Evi-
dently not maintained for
at least some decades.
   Cultivsted land still has
little perennial vegetation.
Woody plants chiefly in rems
of walls & tumbles of scree.
Prickly oak v. ab. up to c.
8 ft high.
Phlomis frut. v. ab., big bushes
some leggy ones c. 6 ft high.
9939
Much Phlomis on the adjoining
hillside is dying bsck, prob.
through age.
   Higher up the slope the vegeta-
tion becomes sparser & more
grazed. Less maquis. Less
oak. [!!!!& more pear]. A sp. of
Rhamnus becomes ab.  (C).
Occ Poterium spinosum (rare
in Thisbe area).
Selaginella becomes ab.

Lowest Pines in spur of Mt
Helicon.   D
Scattered trees to  c. 15 ft high
and c. 6" thick. Often bushy
& forked at base. Many
much eaten down but
some growing up.

Hillside is a mosaic of oak 
& olive - dominated maquis areas

Further up hill, by an aban
9941
doned farm, pines become
denser (c. 50% canopy). None
much bigger, save a few  old
pines (? 1 - 1 1/2 ft dia) in rather
inaccessible places in cliffs.

Small patch of Spartium
Calycotome - dom. scree just
above farm.

Apparently some abandonment
of arable in small plain to
E. of this hill.

Big tortoise - 10" x 5 1/.2 " -

Small amount of Juniperus
phoen in broken rocky spur.

Way to Ay Nik
Juniper
Grafted wild-olive   (26)
Euphorb. dendr.

Apius Nikolaos is a beautiful 
and hitherto lonely bay surrounded
by high rugged cliffs, mainly hard
limestone, with areas of metamor-
phic rocks. Reached hitherto by
a very narrow road over the moun-
tains. A tiny, probably old, farm
and cafe use the only build-
ingd. Recently a new road, still
unfinished, has been blasted in
zigzags through the cliffs.
   Natural vegetation of steep,
mainly S. to S.E. facing slopes.
Much bare rock; what is vege-
tated is largely maquis, with
9947
little garrigue. Juniperus phoe-
nicea and olive are codom-
inant; at higher altitudes mainly
olive, at lower mainly juniper.
Prickly-oak present but not 
abundant.  Euphorbia dendroides
(summer-deciduus) freq. on
rocks. Rock is much broken,
with deep fissures and veins
of terra rossa.
  These slopes are rather
little grazed; bushes mostly c.
6-8 ft high snd growing rapidly.
Somewhat columnar habit sug-
gesting recovery from more se-
vere grezing.
   Most of the olives have at
least their upper leaves of the
lanceolate cultivated kind.
The trunks are usually multiple
[19948-19949]
9948
and slender: the olives look
like relics if a former
attempt to graft the wild-olives
of the maquis.
   The natural vegetation ap-
pears not to change at geo-
logical boundaries e.g. from
debris-fans to metamorphic.

   At Ayios Nikolaos there are
a few hundred acres of cultiva-
tion in an alluvial fan
with deep brown soil. Almost
entirely olives, well-looked after.
Much of the olive-groves is
ancient, with irregularly-spaced
trees c. 2 1/2 ft dia., beginning
to be hollow. Ring-count is
difficult - rings are indistinct -
but suggests age at least 200 y.
9949
This is one of the few areas
of iregularly-set olives in
the district.

Olive bark-beetle. Makes gal-
leries very iike those of the ash
bark-beetle.

Islands in the Gulf of Domvraina.
[SYMBOL] is a long jagged
ridge, 85% covered with tall
maquis or even woodland.
[SYMBOL]  is a high cliff-
bound island seemingly more
difficult to land on, but only
c. 30% maquis, and that low.
[SYMBOL] is also mainly rock
and garrigue. [SYMBOL] similar.

    A storm in Helicon
   The morning at Thisbe was
overcast, still, not particularly
hot, but very humid. Showers
[!!!!] of drizzle fell and
there was a short spell of
more continuous rain on the
mountain.
   In the early afternoon we
went down to Ajios Nikolaus.
Still overcast, warm and humid.
Around 3 p.m. a storm blew
up from the west over the Hal-
cyonic Gulf. Dense black clouds;
rumblings of thunder; lightning
playing around the islands.
The wind got up from the 
S.E. and blew in squalls of
increasing intensity. Around
4.25 p.m. it came on
9951
to rain and we left for [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL]. Rain steadily increased
all the way.
   By the time we reached
M. it was raining hard. The
wind increased and veered
to the S.W.  Much thunder &
lightning over Helicon. Rain
incressed until 6 pm by
which time is was raining at
about 1 1/2 in. an hour. The
yard of our house became
flooded and the street outside
became a river. The inhab-
itants produced umbrellas & 
gumboots and set about dig-
ging channels in the road to
drain water away. The wind
drove rain indoors, e.g. under
doors and slightly flooded the
[19952-19953]
9952
upper storey of the house, The
electicity faltered but did
not cease.
   Around 6.30 p.m. the rain 
slackened and eventually 
ceased. I estimate bhat at
least 1 inch of rain fell in
[SYMBOL].
   The rain in the streets
washed away much of the 
summer's accumulation of
rubbish. Sandy material was
swept away leaving the gravel.
   Much of the village drains
into the western ravine where
a sizeable stream was flowing
through the piles of rubbish
in the bottom of the wadi.
Smell of rain. Not normally
as noticeable as it would be
9953
after a long drought in Eng-
land. In places with much
withered grass, however, there 
is a strong sweet smwll rather
between those of honey & hay,
much stronger than the nor-
mal smell of rain in England.
 Lightning colour, here and
at Paralimni, was pale blue.

Pines on Palaeovouna.
   Apparently confined to its
S.E. spur, and principally the
E. aside.  As far as could be
seen from Thisbe, the rest of this
very complex mountain is covered 
with maquis, with some Abies
above 1200 m.
Probably a native stand;
no evidence of planting. They
[19954-19955]
9954
are rapidly advancing despite
moderate grazing.

Domvraina [?Domvrena] and Thisbe. The vil-
lages are almost contiguous.
Stone houses with tiled roofs.
Many have courses of poles or
timbers in walls (cf p. 9931).
Domvraina has an ancient
church. Domvraina is said to 
have been destroyed by the Ger-
mans, but has many buildings
of evidently later date, although
some ruins could be wartime.
Much of Thisbe is derelict.

Xeronomi and Ellopia. Prosperous
villagea with well-maintained
older houses.

The ridgeway to Vayia is
evidently an ancient route,
intermittently lined with
hedges for much of the way
on the plateau snd forming
a holloway on slopes. It may
well be the ancient route from
Thebes to the Valley of the
Muses.

Vayia Larger thsn Mavrommati,
although the population is much
the same. Unlike Mav, has many
shops and small businesses 
(e.g. China-shop, carpenter).
   Some buildings are of mud-
brick,about 2 x 1 x 1 ft, usually
in disrepair.
Rainwater. Yesterday's downpour
soaked away like magic leaving the
landscape almost as dry as before.

There are vast quantities of
Roman pottery esp. rope-handled

of arable in an illuvial pocket,
and possibly by arable on the
E. Some decades ago it was
evidently protected from grazing.
The result has been to turn
it into a prickly-oak wood.
Most of the tree oaks are single-
stemmed, with rounded crowns.
The maquis-garrigue structure
has remained little changed;
the garrigue has, however,
degenerated towards steppe.
The larger garrigue patches
retain some coridothymus and
there is a general fringe of 
Ballota round the edges of
the oak patches, but with these
exceptions most of the intersti-
ces are bare ground with grass,
Centaurea solstitialis, annuals
[19974-19975]
9974
etc.
   Oak patches are generally
2-storeyed, oak over oak.
Terebinth keeps up with oak
in height but lentise generally
does not.
   The W. part of this maquis-
wood has been more recently
grazed. All vegetation between
very shsrp browse-line at 4 ft
has been severely eaten down.
The oak understorey is almost e-
liminated. There is a small
lentise tree with a    [DIAG]
single trunk eaten in
the same manner as oak.
The grazed part extends
across the wadi, where there are 2

strangely abrupt as if formerly fenced.

   Outside the boundary wall
are:
(1) a pollard terebinth, c.
2 ft dia. and 3" dia. Bark smooth, 
micro-platey, rather like a big

binth in the area and one of the
