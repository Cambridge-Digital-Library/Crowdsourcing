Section across Thisbe plain.
Sloping alluvial land on both
sides of plain is olive groves.
On the S. side these are clearly 
laid out in strips, some of which 
are curved.
Olives end fairly abruptly
on the flat ground (old lake 
bed? - see Paucanias) of the
bottom of the plain.
[19938-19939]
9938
Abandoned Terraces (B)
In shallow gulley in
rock slope next to maquis
previously described.
   Terraces of big stones, some
walls still standing. Area is sep-
arated from maquis by remains
of a wall of big stones. Evi-
dently not maintained for
at least some decades.
   Cultivsted land still has
little perennial vegetation.
Woody plants chiefly in rems
of walls & tumbles of scree.
Prickly oak v. ab. up to c.
8 ft high.
Phlomis frut. v. ab., big bushes
some leggy ones c. 6 ft high.
9939
Much Phlomis on the adjoining
hillside is dying bsck, prob.
through age.
   Higher up the slope the vegeta-
tion becomes sparser & more
grazed. Less maquis. Less
oak. [!!!!& more pear]. A sp. of
Rhamnus becomes ab.  (C).
Occ Poterium spinosum (rare
in Thisbe area).
Selaginella becomes ab.

Lowest Pines in spur of Mt
Helicon.   D
Scattered trees to  c. 15 ft high
and c. 6" thick. Often bushy
& forked at base. Many
much eaten down but
some growing up.
[19940-19941]

Terrain is S.E. facing c. 20Â°
30% base limestone. Well-de-
veloped terra rossa.
Maquis 30% of total cover.

Oak severely grazed to c. 2 ft
high, no leaders forming.

Hillside is a mosaic of oak

Further up hill, by an aban
9941
doned farm. Pines become
denser (c. 50% canopy). None
much bigger, save asfew  old
pines (? 1 - 1 1/2 ft dia) in rather
inaccessible places in cliffs.

Small patch of Spartium
Calycotome - dom. scree just
above fsrm.

Apparently some abandonment
of arable in small plain to
E. of this hill.

Big tortoise - 10" x 5 1/.2 " -
concave underside, hooked beak  
Small amount of Juniperus
phoen in broken rocky spur.
[19942-19943]

   Occasional pines extend in
olive-groves down to 300 m.

Way to Ay Nik
Juniper
Grafted wild-olive   (26)
Euphorb. dendr.

Apius Nikolaos is a beautiful 
and hitherto lonely bay surrounded
by high rugged cliffs, mainly hard
limestone, with areas of metamor-
phic rocks. Reached hitherto by
a very narrow road over the moun-
tains. A tiny, probably old, farm
and cafe use the only build-
ingd. Recently a new road, still
unfinished has been blasted in
zigzags through the cliffs.
   Natural vegetation of steep,
mainly S. to S.E. facing slopes.
Much bare rock; what is vege-
tated is largely maquis, with
9947
little garrigue. Juniperus phoe-
nicea and olive sre codom-
inant; at higher altitudes mainly
Prickly-oak present but not 
abundant.  Euphorbia dendroides
(summer-deciduus) freq. on
rocks. Rock is much broken,
with deep fissures and veins
of terra rossa.
  These slopes are rather
little grazed; bushes mostly c.
6-8 ft high snd growing rapidly.
Someqhat columnar habit sug-
gesting recovery from more se-
vere grezing.
   Most of the olives have at
least their upper leaves of the
lanceolate cultivated kind.
The trunks are usually multiple
[19948-19949]
9948
and slender: the olives look
like relics if a former
attempt to graft the wild-olives
of the maquis.
   The natural vegetation ap-
pears not to change at geo-
logical boundaries e.g. from
debris-fans to metamorphic.

   At Ayios Nikolaos there are
a few hundred acres of cultiva-
tion in an alluvial fan
with deep brown soil. Almost
entirely olives, well-looked after.
Much od the olive-groves is
ancient, with irregularly-spaced
trees x. 21/2 ft dia., beginning
to be hollow. Ring-count is
difficult - rings are indistinct -
but suggests age at least 200 y.
9949
This is one of the few areas
of iregularly-set olives in
the district.

Olive bark-beetle. Makes gal-
leries very iike those of the ash
bark-beetle.

Islands in the Gulf of Domvraina.
[SYMBOL] is a long jagged
ridge, 85% covered with tall
maquis or even woodland.
[SYMBOL]  is a high cliff-
bound island seemingly more
difficult to land on, but only
c. 30% maquis, and that low.
[SYMBOL] is also mainly rock
anf garrigue. [SYMBOL] similar.

    A storm in Helicon
   The morning at Thisbe was
overcast, still, not particularly
hot, but very humid. Showers
[!!!!] odf drizzle fell and
there was a short spell of
more continuous rain on the
mountain.
   In the early afternoon we
went down to Ajios Nikolaus.
Still overcast, warm and humid.
Around 3 p.m. a storm blew
up from the west over the Hal-
cyonic Gulf. Dense black clouds;
rumblings of thunder; lightning
playing around the islands.
The wind got up from the 
S.E. and blew in squalls of
increasing intensity. Around
4.25 p.m. it came on
9951
to rain and we left for [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL]. Rain steadily increased
all the way.
   By the time we reached
M. it was raining hard. The
wind increased and veered
to the S.W.  Much thunder &
lightning over Helicon. Rain
incressed until 6 pm by
which time is was raining at
about 1 /2 in. an hour. The
yard of our house became
flooded and the street outside
bwcme a river. The inhab-
itants produced umbrellas & 
gumboots and set about dig-
ging channels in the road to
drain water away. The wind
drove rain indoors, e.g. under
doors and slightly flooded the
[19952-19953]
9952
upper storey of the house, The
electicity faltered but did
not cease.
   Around 6.30 p.m. the rain 
slackened and eventually 
ceased. I estimate bhat at
least 1 cinh. of rain fell in
[SYMBOL].
   The rain in the streets
washed away much of the 
summer's accumulation of
rubbish. Sandy material was
swept away leaving the gravel.
   Much of the village drains
into the western ravine where
a sizeable stream was flowing
through the piles of rubbish
in the bottom of the wadi.
Smell of rain. Not normally
as noticeable as it would be
