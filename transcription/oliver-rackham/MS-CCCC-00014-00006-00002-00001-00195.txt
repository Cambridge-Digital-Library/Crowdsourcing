The wood is mainly on
talus of the lower cliffs, in
places on limestone rocks.
Soil very variable in depth but

5275
84. Plagiothecium: abundant masses
on trunk of Tilia platy.
85: Hedingia: ab. on shady
limestone rock.
86: Radula ibid.
[SYMBOL]
Well-developed and seldom
<6in. Slopes usually c. 5° - 30°;
aspect generally N. and N.E.
Horizon much restricted by
high cliffs to the S.
The beginning of the
woodland to the S.E. is
diffuse, with several acres
of scrub. This contains rem-
ains of walls and is prob-
ably secondary. The beg-
inning of the primary wood-
land is not well defined.

[15276-15277]
5276

Beech.
Rare in scrub, codominant
with Tilia platyphyllos in the 
outer gorge, becoming domin-
ant at higher altitudes.
Dominant ab o over most
of the surrounding mountains
to c. 1000 m. Small standard
trees; [!!!!]and[!!!!] a small proportion
of overgrown large-coppice
stools (c. 4 X 1/2 ft). Largest
trees c. 1 ft dia. Saplings 
few.

Tilia.
Codominant with beech in the
outer gorge. Mainly as small
standard trees to c. 2 ft dia.
and 40 ft high, which are usually

[15278-15279]
5277
maidens. Stools numerous, some-
times very large, overgrown. No
recent regeneration. Probably all
playphyllos.

Oak.
Mainly Q. pubescens as small
trees in scrub. Standard trees
in beech-lime wood are few,
probably pubescens x robur.

Conifers.
Scattered throughout the wood-
land but probably only 2% of 
trees. Spruce commonest.

Alder.
Alnus incana grows in a 
nearly continuous narrow strip

5278
along the Bresson. With occasional birch.

Acer. 
A. opalus frequent, chiefly
in scrub and along the stream. Others
scattered in the wood.

Many trees already show
autumn colours.
Ground vegetation notably
sparse, though rich in species;
probably due to dense shade and
deep beech litter. More abundant
on bare scree and rocks round
the Cascade.
The stream provides a highly
disturbed habitat.

5279

Elms.
No large trees seen small
trees (up to pole size) frequent
along the Bresson (seldom in
closed forest), by the Allée du
Château, in the scrub leading 
by the lane therefrom to the
town.
Mostly a small-rough-leaved
type, weakly suckering, with
prominent ridges developing
early in the trunk (though 
seldom on the twigs).
Another type has larger
hollandica-type leaves. Oc-
curs with the above in the
lane but much less frequently.
Elm disease affects c.
3% of trees (excluding those

[15280-15281]
5280

that are prematurely yellow
almost certainly from natural
causes). One dead pole-sized
tree seen. Specific symptoms
in this and other cases.

Foret du Bresson.
Quite exceptionally rich in
trees & shrubs, many of these 
confined to the scrub at the
edge of the grassland and 
cultivation.
The inaccessible situation
(access at one point confined
to the bed of the Bresson) markes
primary woodland inherently likely.
Certainly coppiced for centuries.
No cutting done for at leave 30
years. [!!!!]Natural regeneration has not[!!!!]

5281
[DIAG]

[15282-15283]
5282
Elm occurs but does not
invade.
Natural regernation has not 
occurred on any scale since the
last coppicing. So far little natural
death of trees.
Woodland structure consists 
at present of small standard
trees (c. 40ft high) with large
coppice of nearly the same height,
together forming an almost
complete canopy. Small coppice
& shrubs very sparse.
Bryophytes abundant but
probably few species.
Note Convallaria present but
not, apparently, Tilia cordata.

5283

Sept. 28.
Elm disease.
An ornamental variety resem-
bling U. glabra, planted beside
Notre-Dame, Paris. About 20
trees, all unaffected.
Northern outer suburbs of
Paris. Large thickets of sucker-
ing carpinifolia. About 60%
of trees (up to small pole
size) affected; 5% with more
than 30% defoliation; 1/2% dead.
Attacks mostly this year. Spe-
cific symptoms. A few deaths
have occurred in previous years.
Around Creil: suckering
carpinif. & holl. up to young mature
size. 80% affected, 5% with >1/3
defoliation; none dead. This year's attacks
specific symptoms.

[15284-15285]
5284
Wood around Orry-la-Ville-Coye.
Several miles across, mar-
ching over hill & dale, with the
station in the midst. At least
in part on limestone, but
some at least is acid. S. 
edge may have a wood bank;
N. edge abuts on the town
of Chantilly.
Structure very varied.
Mostly irregular high forest,
a mosaic of various mixtures
of species. Large tracts of
bracken with scattered trees.
Little coppice structure but 
one area of c. 1 acre cut
last winter.
Mainly oak & beech domin-
ant.

5285

Tilia cordata loc. ab.
Mainly large overgrown coppice
as at Hockering, but mixed
with other species.
Birch loc. ab.
Ash rare.
Hornbeam ab., often over-grown coppice.
Elm only in the N. frin-
ges.
No cherry seen, although it is 
abundant in railway scrub nearby.

Elms.
For some 30 mi. S. of Longu-
eau. Mainly large-leaved holl-
andica types, but some carpinifo-
lia and? procera. Scrub, hedges,
and small groves, up to small

[15286-15287]
5286

mature size. About 10% af-
fected, 1% severely. Specific.
Amiens to Abbeville and 
beyond. Mainly carpinifolia types.
Hedges and small  groves. Mostly
pole-sized; few mature trees. About
60% affected, 3% severely. Specific.
Coastal area (Étaples to 
Boulogne). Elms numerous, of-
ten mature, a very few old
and pollard. Mainly procera &
hollandica. About 5% infec-
ted. None seriously damaged,
but traces of more serious
effects in previous seasons.
The undercliff between
Dover and Folkestone is a
tract of very broken and pitted
ground thickly overgrown

5287
with scrub and Clematis.
Numerous U. procera in
Folkestone - none affected.

Hayley Wood. With W. Palmer:

5305
marking out coppice plots and
general visit.

There has been extensive defo-
liation of all 
trees and bushes [DIAG]
along about 200
yards of Hayley Lane
S. of the Melampyrum
hedge. Damage extends
for the fall width
of Old Hayley Lane
and slightly into the wood proper.
The ancient oak pollard is
slightly affected. Leaves fallen
(occasionally shrivelled but still
on tree). Twigs not burnt.
Cause appears to be heat from
a stubble fire.

[15306-15307]
5306
The tyre dump which recently
filled the whole of the old railway
cutting from Hayley Wood to the
site of Littlehound has just burnt
out, except for a length of about
100 yards nearest Hayley. The
fire was still alight when seen
but has nearly burnt itself out.
Wind in N.E. No direct damage
to the Wood.
A small fierce fire has
recently occurred in the middle
of the railway track a few
yards E. of Mr. Cox's level crossing.
Electrical cables & equipment
found in the remains. Heat
has shrivelled leaves on scrub
along the railway and on a
few trees in the Wood.

perhaps because deer have
grazed the stools.

Eastern elm area interior.
Premature leaf fall in per-
haps 1/4 of trees, chiefly in the 
younger emergents, usually

[15318-15319]
5318

confined to the top 3-4 ft of
the crown. Occasionally with
specific symptoms. Commonest
in trees at margin of elm
area where it abuts on other
woodland. Evidence of group-
ing of affected trees is incon-
clusive. Already impossible to
tell what proportion of this is
due to elm disease.

Deer fence.
Holes are larger and nearly
irreparable. [!!!!]Twigs[!!!!] Stems of some sallow
stools - not other species - have
been broken about halfway up,
but not eaten.
Little grazing of coppice in
the unfenced half of the plot.

Mr Hughes
Cox said [SYMBOL] to him that sparks (from
a nearby stubble fire or bon-
fire) had ignited the tyres.
The smoke [SYMBOL] according to Hughes went over Little
Gransden village but came
down again beyond, and at
[SYMBOL]'s [name unfamiliar] you
couldn't see your hand before
your face, and there was 
going to be a bit of a row
about it.
Hughes had found two
deer snares of copper wire
which he said were put there
by B- J-'s son. He [Hughes]
had them in his car. He had
seen this man armed in
or near the Wood recently.

[15320-15321]
5330

He said the Wood was
advertised for sale at 93 acres
excluding the Triangle when
it was separated from Gransden
Lodge. This figure apparently
included the 9-acre field
known as Oggseads, which
at that time was bushed over.
Coppice regrowth varied a
great deal in the old days, which
Mr H. attributed chiefly to the 
weather.
He spoke of an "American"
oak near Pond Ride, and
said several other trees were
hybrids between this and the 
ordinary form.
He said there had been
some complaints from visitors

5321
about Hayley Lane not being
cut as heretofore. He would be
willing to take a tractor and 
cut this lame and other rides.
He would also be willing to help
with extracting logs.
He had been ery busy during 
the summer with steam plow-
ing in various parts of the
country, including the European
championships in Dorset. He
had been laid up for a week
with pleurisy.

or wholly free. Within a hedge
small groups of trees are com-
monly dead, other parts of the
hedge a few yards away often
being uninfected. Symptoms ap-
pear to have stopt developing
[!!!!]some[!!!!] a few weeks ago. Bark
being stript from recently dead

measures by culting off top
branches of small trees.
Guildford: In addition these

and equalling Bradfield.
Taller stems stout, with leaves
c. 6 in. dia.
Elm suckers abundant
and vigorous in places. As
yet no apparent extension
of clone C.
A considerable proportion
of the hazel has been cut
with a sharp instrument (known
not to be teeth because of
occasional damage to stems
not severed). Callus growth
on stems not severed suggests
that this took place around
1 August, although D.E.C.
says it was intact until
about 1 September. Usually

[15332-15333]
5332

only the marginal shoots (2-3
min dia.) are taken, leaving
the bigger ones in the middles,
but sometimes the entire stool
is cut over. Leaves taken
away with the stems. Elm
only occasionally attacked.
Most of the timer has 
been sold to the E. Hatley [????]
breaker and removed.
Ash regrowth less  vigorous
than in Hayley. Hornbeam

Elm Disease.
Clone A. Only one tree is un-
usual. Mature tree. External
symptom of uneveness between
the leaf senescence of different
branches. Internally
there are transverse [DIAG]
brown flecks about
1 mm long in the
inner phloem. Perhaps
some pathological condition but
no positive sign of elm dis-
ease.
Clone C. About 12 trees, all
large poles c. 50 ft high, show 
defoliation of the leading
shoot. Symptoms affect usu-
ally about 3 ft of the top
of the tree, with side branches.

5341

Usually positive identification.
In two trees the disease in-
volves about half the crown.
These have been marked for 
felling. Several trees are
infected simultaneously with
wetwood and elm disease.
Clone E. Several small
groups of affeced trees along
the [!!!!]ditch[!!!!]ride between the two
moats and to the N. of it.
They apparently all belong 
to this clone. Total about
30 trees. 18 have been
marked for felling; about
6 of these appeared to be
dead and the rest more
than half leafless. Speci-
fic symptoms common. A

[15342-15343]
5342

few of the dead trees have
been partly barked by birds.
Trees are attacked from
the top downwards. The
big elm in this area which
has been more than half
killed, probably by this dis-
ease. in previous years, now
shows only a few active
twigs and the dead limbs
are mostly debarked. This
is to be left. The disease
has not extended appreciably
since July. [!!!!]and is[!!!!} In com-
parison with last year it
has probaly killed or severely
damaged a few trees that
were moderately infected then
but has not appreciably ex-

5343

tended its range.
Clone U: one tree leafless
in the top c. 2 ft, but no
specific symptoms and surroun-
ding trees unaffected. Probably
not this disease.
Clone D: see under wet-wood.
A small tree E. of the
pond nearest the church (a 
relict of a hedge) appears
to be severely damaged and 
should be felled.

Wet-wood.
Seriously affects only C
and D, though present in some
others.
Clone C. Affects the mature
tree and most of the poles.

[15344-15345]
Stem fluxes now dry. Bran-
ches in lower crown partly
dead, characteristically dead
on one side and with a
living and callus-forming sector
on the other side. No crown
symptoms. No wet-wood ridges?
Clone D. Affected probably
throughout.
Four trees, all young
mature, severely affected. Two
stone dead; two nearly dead,
with islands of normal
foliage remaining in the
outer part of the crown. All
these have wet-wood
ridges.
Almost certainly not
Dutch elm disease: (a) the

5345

four trees are [SYMBOL] from eachother isolated and
surrounded by trees of the
same clone and similar statue
which show no signs of that
disease (though a few have
lower branches recenly
dead); (b) no specific sym-
ptoms (though on the tree
small epicormics show slight
epinasty near the base of
the trunk); (c) death appears 
to proceed outwards from the
lower middle crown and not
(as in woodland Dutch elm)
starting at the top and
working down branch by branch.
These are marked D.

S.W. Moat.
H was formerly thought
to fill the moat and to be
mixed with D.
Today we showed that
H (wih U, which appears to
be identical but is separated
from it by a gap and was
recorded separately) occurs
in 3 strips forming 3 sides
of a hollow quadrilateral.
The N.E. side coincides
with the moat (H on both
sides of the moat). The N.W.
side is entirely inside the
moat. The S.W. side corresponds 
to no earthwork. V, another
late-leafing elm probably dif-
ferent from H and U, lines

5347

this side of the moat on
the inside.
Another clone, T, is now
shown to be distinct from D.
It fills the hallow quadri-
lateral and escapes from it at
the W. and S. corners.
None of the elms appears
to sucker across a deep
part of the moat.

The S.W. part of the range
attributes last year to D is
in fact occupied by a clone W,
which crosses into the 1968
coppice (from which D is absent)
and marginally into the old
wood. W does not appear to
get wet-wood. W and D

[15348-15349]
5348

mix over a substantial
depth on equal terms. W
and L appear to have a 
sharp boundary.

1. Fistulina hepatica. One
large sporophore at the base
of an oak which has suc-
cumbed (or is about to) to

X is a solitary procera-
