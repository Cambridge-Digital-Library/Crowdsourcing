Pimpinella saxifraga - abundant
and large in the lower more
open parts of the wood.

The wood is mainly on
talus of the lower cliffs, in
places on limestone rocks.
Soil very variable in depth but

5275
84. Plagiothecium: abundant masses
on trunk of Tilia platy.
85: Hedingia: ab. on shady
limestone rock.
86: Radula ibid.
[SYMBOL]
Well-developed and seldom
<6in. Slopes usually c. 5° - 30°;
aspect generally N. and N.E.
Horizon much restricted by
high cliffs to the S.
The beginning of the
woodland to the S.E. is
diffuse, with several acres
of scrub. This contains rem-
ains of walls and is prob-
ably secondary. The beg-
inning of the primary wood-
land is not well defined.

[15276-15277]
5276

Beech.
Rare in scrub, codominant
with Tilia platyphyllos in the 
outer gorge, becoming domin-
ant at higher altitudes.
Dominant ab o over most
of the surrounding mountains
to c. 1000 m. Small standard
trees; [!!!!]and[!!!!] a small proportion
of overgrown large-coppice
stools (c. 4 X 1/2 ft). Largest
trees c. 1 ft dia. Saplings 
few.

Tilia.
Codominant with beech in the
outer gorge. Mainly as small
standard trees to c. 2 ft dia.
and 40 ft high, which are usually

[15278-15279]
5277
maidens. Stools numerous, some-
times very large, overgrown. No
recent regeneration. Probably all
playphyllos.

Oak.
Mainly Q. pubescens as small
trees in scrub. Standard trees
in beech-lime wood are few,
probably pubescens x robur.

Conifers.
Scattered throughout the wood-
land but probably only 2% of 
trees. Spruce commonest.

Alder.
Alnus incana grows in a 
nearly continuous narrow strip

5278
along the Bresson. With occasional birch.

Acer. 
A. opalus frequent, chiefly
in scrub and along the stream. Others
scattered in the wood.

Many trees already show
autumn colours.
Ground vegetation notably
sparse, though rich in species;
probably due to dense shade and
deep beech litter. More abundant
on bare scree and rocks round
the Cascade.
The stream provides a highly
disturbed habitat.

5279

Elms.
No large trees seen small
trees (up to pole size) frequent
along the Bresson (seldom in
closed forest), by the Allée du
Château, in the scrub leading 
by the lane therefrom to the
town.
Mostly a small-rough-leaved
type, weakly suckering, with
prominent ridges developing
early in the trunk (though 
seldom on the twigs).
Another type has larger
hollandica-type leaves. Oc-
curs with the above in the
lane but much less frequently.
Elm disease affects c.
3% of trees (excluding those

[15280-15281]
5280

that are prematurely yellow
almost certainly from natural
causes). One dead pole-sized
tree seen. Specific symptoms
in this and other cases.

Foret du Bresson.
Quite exceptionally rich in
trees & shrubs, many of these 
confined to the scrub at the
edge of the grassland and 
cultivation.
The inaccessible situation
(access at one point confined
to the bed of the Bresson) markes
primary woodland inherently likely.
Certainly coppiced for centuries.
No cutting done for at leave 30
years. [!!!!]Natural regeneration has not[!!!!]

5281
[DIAG]

[15282-15283]
5282
Elm occurs but does not
invade.
Natural regernation has not 
occurred on any scale since the
last coppicing. So far little natural
death of trees.
Woodland structure consists 
at present of small standard
trees (c. 40ft high) with large
coppice of nearly the same height,
together forming an almost
complete canopy. Small coppice
& shrubs very sparse.
Bryophytes abundant but
probably few species.
Note Convallaria present but
not, apparently, Tilia cordata.

5283

Sept. 28.
Elm disease.
An ornamental variety resem-
bling U. glabra, planted beside
Notre-Dame, Paris. About 20
trees, all unaffected.
Northern outer suburbs of
Paris. Large thickets of sucker-
ing carpinifolia. About 60%
of trees (up to small pole
size) affected; 5% with more
than 30% defoliation; 1/2% dead.
Attacks mostly this year. Spe-
cific symptoms. A few deaths
have occurred in previous years.
Around Creil: suckering
carpinif. & holl. up to young mature
size. 80% affected, 5% with >1/3
defoliation; none dead. This year's attacks
specific symptoms.

[15284-15285]
5284
Wood around Orry-la-Ville-Coye.
Several miles across, mar-
ching over hill & dale, with the
station in the midst. At least
in part on limestone, but
some at least is acid. S. 
edge may have a wood bank;
N. edge abuts on the town
of Chantilly.
Structure very varied.
Mostly irregular high forest,
a mosaic of various mixtures
of species. Large tracts of
bracken with scattered trees.
Little coppice structure but 
one area of c. 1 acre cut
last winter.
Mainly oak & beech domin-
ant.

5285

Tilia cordata loc. ab.
Mainly large overgrown coppice
as at Hockering, but mixed
with other species.
Birch loc. ab.
Ash rare.
Hornbeam ab., often over-grown coppice.
Elm only in the N. frin-
ges.
No cherry seen, although it is 
abundant in railway scrub nearby.

Elms.
For some 30 mi. S. of Longu-
eau. Mainly large-leaved holl-
andica types, but some carpinifo-
lia and? procera. Scrub, hedges,
and small groves, up to small

[15286-15287]
5286

mature size. About 10% af-
fected, 1% severely. Specific.
Amiens to Abbeville and 
beyond. Mainly carpinifolia types.
Hedges and small  groves. Mostly
pole-sized; few mature trees. About
60% affected, 3% severely. Specific.
Coastal area (Étaples to 
Boulogne). Elms numerous, of-
ten mature, a very few old
and pollard. Mainly procera &
hollandica. About 5% infec-
ted. None seriously damaged,
but traces of more serious
effects in previous seasons.
The undercliff between
Dover and Folkestone is a
tract of very broken and pitted
ground thickly overgrown

5287
with scrub and Clematis.
Numerous U. procera in
Folkestone - none affected.

Fell; also into Hewitt's Meadow
and along Rookery Ride.
An interesting site is the
S. edge of Strawberry Bank, with
a wood-ditch 7ft deep where
scrub has grown over the out-
side a &nd provides light shade for
the bank.

Mr Frost. Met in Shady
Ride, where he was out with
his family.
Said he had been in 
charge of the woods for 33
years from 1929, and had
been retired 155 years [sic]. Clai-
med to know every detail of them.
"The old monks" had "hou
ses and g[????] buildings" (abo
referred to as sheds) "along
Felsham Hall Glearde" (not
clear whether this refers to the
Phragmites site or the Planta-
tion).
He had spent 3 years
draining the woods with 6 miles
of ditches. He spoke of part of

Charity Fell.
Southern half visited.
A broad strip of completely
untouched coppice.
Low massive wood-bank
as elsewhere in MPW.
Dominated over most
of its area by an elm with
the following characters: Non
suckering. Stools middle sized
to very large (largest 10 ft
X c. 6 ft). Some large stools on
wood bank. Leaf shape much
as U. glabra with a longer
stalk. Leaves glossy, nearly
smooth. This elm is an almost
p[????] stand sharply delimited
on the S. by a ride and pro-
bably also on the N. Within

the elm area there is little
else save hazel.
Few or no oaks in this fell.
Cherry frequent on margin,
saplings and poles (largest c.
6 in. dia.).
No internal surface fea-
tures seen save the ride dit-
ches. Ann Hart says there
was a pond in roughly the
position shown but we did not
find it.
Ground vegetation dominated
by mercury. Patches of Poa
triv. No bramble areas. Pre-
sumably calcareous and fairly
dry.
October 4.
Hayley Wood. With W. Palmer:

5305
marking out coppice plots and
general visit.

There has been extensive defo-
liation of all 
trees and bushes [DIAG]
along about 200
yards of Hayley Lane
S. of the Melampyrum
hedge. Damage extends
for the fall width
of Old Hayley Lane
and slightly into the wood proper.
The ancient oak pollard is
slightly affected. Leaves fallen
(occasionally shrivelled but still
on tree). Twigs not burnt.
Cause appears to be heat from
a stubble fire.

[15306-15307]
5306
The tyre dump which recently
filled the whole of the old railway
cutting from Hayley Wood to the
site of Littlehound has just burnt
out, except for a length of about
100 yards nearest Hayley. The
fire was still alight when seen
but has nearly burnt itself out.
Wind in N.E. No direct damage
to the Wood.
A small fierce fire has
recently occurred in the middle
of the railway track a few
yards E. of Mr. Cox's level crossing.
Electrical cables & equipment
found in the remains. Heat
has shrivelled leaves on scrub
along the railway and on a
few trees in the Wood.

5307
Deer fence has numerous
holes in the bottom and needs
time-consuming repairs. No 
evidence that deer have been
grazing inside.
