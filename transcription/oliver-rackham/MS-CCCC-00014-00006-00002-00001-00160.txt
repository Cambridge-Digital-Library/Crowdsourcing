Porter's Lane Hedges
The lane itself is about
15ft wide between narrow
relatively straight hedges.
There is little difference
between the two hedges.
The lane between field corners
at 335555 and 330548 is very
overgrown with bushes
leaving only a narrow path
in the middle.
Cowslips frequent, the only 
Primula.
The lane is patchy in
its composition, with stretches
of various elms in some
cases with the decayed
remains of[SYMBOL]regularly spaced
standard trees suggesting
planting. Ulmus procera
perhaps the most frequent elm.
Crataegus hybrids are
frequent throughout. Quite
good oxyacanthoides (but lacking
the two styles) were found
at the N.E. end of the lane
and near 330548. These are
both in the original hedges
and in the scrub which chokes
the lane.
The hedges are probably of
considerable age but not
primary because
1.[!!!!]16 woody species in the
S.E hedge, 12 in the N; but
this number achieved in about
1400 yards and seldom 
more than 6 together.

[12104-12105]
2. Original hedge very straight
and narrow.
3. No viburnums.
No mercury or oxslip or any
other woodland characteristic.
The hedge to the N.E.
of Kingston Wood (p   )
once formed the boundary
of Kingston Wood Manor for
part of its length. The rest
is strikingly different;[!!!!]
it is a hawthorn hedge being
invaded by elm (U.procera) from the
lane. The manor hedge has
an elm length and otherwise
appears to be mixed.
The length of lane N.E.
of the wood, which once
formed the manor boundary,
is bordered on the S.E. by a
thick hawthorn–elm hedge.
No woodland plants except mercury. Cowslips
abundant here and round the
wood edge, but no oxlips.
Kingston Wood.
Section to show slope at
N. edge of wood.
[DIAG]
As at the S. edge of

[12106-12107]
Hayley, the bottom of the valley
is a few yards inside the
wood.
Oxlip flowers are nearly
over. Bluebells flowering at
their best.
Bluebells are very marginal.
Co[????]opodium was found in
Section 1 by the main N. – S.
ride.
Coppicing.
About 1/2acre done 1966,
1.7 acres 1967, 1.3 acres 1968.
Standard oaks left
standing. Large coppice
not cut; in this area the
standards are denser than in
Hayley and the large coppice
less dense.
Hazel cut with several
blows of an axe, steeply
downwards, at ground level.
Almost all have been removed.
No marginal belts left.
Mercury (dominant in
much of the area) reduced.
Oxlips probably not in-
creased.
Bluebells abundant.
Filipendula abundant.
Orchis mascula frequent
and striking.
Circium palustra notably
abundant in 1968 plot.
Hazel grows about 1ft
in the first year, reaching
c. 3 ft in the 2nd year and

[12108-12109]
4ft in the third.
Hawthorn coppices quite
freely; only hybrids seen,
and these much less abundant
than hazel.
Oliver Cromwell's hole.
A curious pond clea[????]ly
dug out articficially on the
slope of a hill. Surrounded
by up-cast. Pond c. 10ft x 6ft,
with overflow channel.
Surrounded by hawthorn
thicket (mainly monogyna, a few
hybrid bushes). No woodland
plants.
The end of Porter's Way by the
Golden Lion is overgrown and
impassable through water.
N. W. of Edgehill Farm the
field from Porter's Way to the
old railway is fallow this year.

Little colonization of ballast

Much grassland remains
on earthworks.
Few Crataegus hybrids, no
good oxyacanthoides.
Purple Comfrey, one large
plant.
Rosa rubiginosa occurs near
the over-bridge.
Anthriscus is very local
and sparse where it occurs.
Rhamnus occurs locally in
Porter's Lane about halfway to
Kingston Wood.
Dryopteris felix[????] grows on
Kingston Church.
There are several old elm
pollards around Kingston, some
recently cut.
A mild thunderstorm at
Cambridge in the evening.

See notes on map.

  Soil samples A & B dug.
A:  1868 coppice,
B: Main Allium area, near W.
cross-roads.

   The ruins of the wood-house
are about 110 paces W. of the E.
cross-roads, a few yards S.

rather brambly glade with large
mounds of nettles apparently
with no masonry remains.

A remarkable small patch
of Phragmites, though not ob-

   The area of soil sample
B is a dense stand of

  The W. part of the main 
ride has deep ruts with
much water.  Veronica Becca-
bunga occurs.
  The only known occurrence 
of Paris is near here.
   Numerous nettle mounds

   Detailed survey of western

  Campanula trachelium is
