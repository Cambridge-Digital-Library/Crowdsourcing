Porter's Lane Hedges
the lane itself is about
15ft wide between narrow
relatively straight hedges.
There is little difference
between the hedges.
The lane between field corners
at 335555 and 330548 is very
overgrown with bushes
leaving only a narrow path
in the middle.
Cowslips frequent, the only 
Primula.
The lane is patchy in
its composition, with stretches
of various elms in some
cases with the decayed
remains of[SYMBOL]regularly spaced
standard trees suggesting
planting. Ulmus procera
perhaps the most frequent elm.
Crataegus hybrids are
frequent throughout. Quite
good oxyacanthoides (but lacking
the two styles) were found
at the N.E. end of the lane
and near 330548. These are
both in the original hedges
and in the scrub which chokes
the lane.
The hedges are probably of
considerable age but not
primary because
1[!!!!][????][!!!!]16 woody species in the
S.E hedge, 12 in the N; but
this number achieved in about
1400 yards and seldom 
more than 6 together.
