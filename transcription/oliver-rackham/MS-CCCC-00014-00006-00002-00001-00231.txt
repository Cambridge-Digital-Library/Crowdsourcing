 29 AUG. 1976           Drought cont.
Japanese Cherry - little affected,
but the one just putside the S.E.
corner of the garden, probably affected
with silver leaf, is now nearly dead.
  Lilac - some leaves withered,
but less affected than those in Cam-
bridge.
  Tutsan - unaffected
  Holly - now about 10ft high, of
which 9" this year; unaffected.
  Cotoneaster microphylla -
rather chlorotic, fruiting with un-
usual vigour.
Mousehold
  Plantago coronopsis - very drought
resistant.
  Fennel occurs on a scarp by
Valley Drive
[17934-17935]
7934
Rumex acetosella also somewhat resistant.
Has revived even on the most
burnt up grassland.
 Deschampsia flex has suffered 
moderately.
 Teuconium little affected.
 Bracken; much premature yellowing
& browning esp in hilltops & S.facing
slopes. some green frond-tips blackened
as if by frost. 
  Furze: little affected. About 
1/2% of the bushes, mainly on the
northern heathland, are Ulex
prob. gallii, which is now conspicuous
by being in full flower. Flowers
scattered over the bushes.
  Heather. About 15% of bushes
affected by drought. Generally less
severe than Dersingham, with little
killing. Affected bushes do not
7935
flower much. Most of the heather
is in mid-flowering.
  Birch. About 20% of trees
show symptoms, ranging from yellowing
of a proportion of the leaves to
(rarely) almost complete leaf fall.
Occurs irregularly, most common
among smaller trees, and in the 
north in the heather areas. Not
clear which species is the more
affected.
  Erica cinerea unaffected.
  Most of the grassland is
completely brown, with no sign
of life, except in somewhat
eutrophic hollows. Rumex acetosella
alone remains green, Deschampsia
flexuosa in the open is moe 
severely affected than under 
trees.
