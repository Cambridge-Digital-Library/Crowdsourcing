 29 AUG. 1976           Drought cont.
Japanese Cherry - little affected,
but the one just putside the S.E.
corner of the garden, probably affected
with silver leaf, is now nearly dead.
  Lilac - some leaves withered,
but less affected than those in Cam-
bridge.
  Tutsan - unaffected
  Holly - now about 10ft high, of
which 9" this year; unaffected.
  Cotoneaster microphylla -
rather chlorotic, fruiting with un-
usual vigour.
Mousehold
  Plantago coronopsis - very drought
resistant.
  Fennel occurs on a scarp by
Valley Drive
[17934-17935]
7934
Rumex acetosella also somewhat resistant.
Has revived even on the most
burnt up grassland.
 Deschampsia flex has suffered 
moderately.
 Teuconium little affected.
 Bracken; much premature yellowing
& browning esp in hilltops & S.facing
slopes. some green frond-tips blackened
as if by frost. 
  Furze: little affected. About 
1/2% of the bushes, mainly on the
northern heathland, are Ulex
prob. gallii, which is now conspicuous
by being in full flower. Flowers
scattered over the bushes.
  Heather. About 15% of bushes
affected by drought. Generally less
severe than Dersingham, with little
killing. Affected bushes do not
7935
flower much. Most of the heather
is in mid-flowering.
  Birch. About 20% of trees
show symptoms, ranging from yellowing
of a proportion of the leaves to
(rarely) almost complete leaf fall.
Occurs irregularly, most common
among smaller trees, and in the 
north in the heather areas. Not
clear which species is the more
affected.
  Erica cinerea unaffected.
  Most of the grassland is
completely brown, with no sign
of life, except in somewhat
eutrophic hollows. Rumex acetosella
alone remains green, Deschampsia
flexuosa in the open is moe 
severely affected than under 
trees.
[17936-17937]
7936
  There have been only a few
small fires, the largest being of
about an acre near the N. corner
in light birch of about 15
years' growth over bracken and much
residual heather. This took
place some weeks ago: most of the
birches are sproutimg from the
base. Much of the heather 
survives. Birches burnt in last
year's fires are mostly growing
again, including some sprouting
from the trunks.
  A BAT was seen at dusk
flying around over the garden.
  Slight thunderstorm with light-
ning and quite heavy rain towards
evening.
7937
  Yesterday's rain left pools in
hollows on Mousehold.
Tortoises.
  Nickey measures 6 3/4 x 4 1/2 in.
  About three weeks ago a
strange tortoise appeared in the 
garden and stayed for a fortnight.
It was much bigger than Nickey
(about 15" long). It was not 
used to eating lettuce and had
to be taught. It took it slowly,
pausing to "chew the cud" between
every two or three mouthfuls.
Nickey reacted to the newcomer
in an apparently aggressive way,
running after it round the
pen. When the newcomer got
into a corner Nickey would
stand berhind, and withdrawing
[17938-17939]
7938
his head would "rear up on his
front legs like lightning" and 
butt the other with his shell
with a noise that could be heard
all over the garden. When the 
newcomer was outside the pen
(now formed of boards about
2" high) Nickey, though unable 
to see it, would butt the .

  Severe thunderstorm from
about 9 to 11 p.m. Sheet lightning
mainly blue, and loud thunder.
Aug 30.
  Heavy rain with occasional
thunder on way back to Cambridge
and intermittently for much of the
day. 
  Half the lake at the Botanic
7939
Gardens is totally dry and the
remainder very shrunken: the
ducks are all congregated there.
Aug. 31      [DIAG]
  Further heavy rain
for much of the day.
Sept. 1
Two branches of about
4" dia. fell from a Lombardy
poplar on Sheep's Green, apparently
under weight of rain. One
wetwooded, the other sound.
Sept. 2.
  More quite heavy rain.
Sept. 3.
  About half the Leckhampton
lawn is now green again: it 
occurs in patches evidently
corresponding to the more easily
revived grasses.

No previous DED  6 x 6 1/2" dia. 
  The big Ulmus glabra on the
N of the road between Toft & Bourn
is getting stagheaded. Leaves
rather few this year, some brown-
ing at the edges.
    Sycamores at Bourn &
Longstowe are badly droughted.
Some big trees have all their
leaves shrivelled & brown.
 The big Boxworth-type elms
at Longstowe are losing their
7941
leaves one by one - an effect
not seen in other elms this year.
  Of the 8 upstanding Tilia
cordata outside Hayley Wood,
7 have lost nearly all their
leaves. The other is almost normal.
Basal twigs less affected, but
some have severe browning.
  The small schoolroom at
Longstowe (with polyploidy) is being un-
roofed.    HAYLEY WOOD.
Sept. 5.
  Beech trees particularly affected by
drought in belts S.W. of the
main road in Babraham. Many
trees have most of their leaves
brown or in severe cases are
qui794te leafless. Similar damage in
beech belts in Wood Ditton.

middle of the avenue, where there
are several gaps, are small-leaved
and chlorotic.
  The limes in Lavenham 
churchyard are small-leaved and
very yellowish. Leaf area index
is reduced - crowns can be seen
through.
  Severe scorching and hedge-
burning round Dunton's Farm in
Long Melford: also severely affected
by DED.
  Stonecrop on roofs in Lavenham 
is showing some green again
after the drought, especially in
valley roofs.

Wasps. There have been three
nests this year in the garden at
Waldingfield. One was in an
old mousehole which also had
a wasps' nest last year. About
a week ago all three were
dug up in the night, probably
by a badger which has left
claw-marks on the edges of
the excavations. Each nest was
about 6" dia. and 3" below
ground. A few live wasps still
hang about the excavations.

parently to the advantage of the

                   Commander 
                 Holdsworth has
                 made many small

            suffered badly from drought.
It passes by a pond,  some 3ft
above normal water level. The
trees next to the pond have made
less growth in the past than the
rest of the row abnd now appear

is little affected.
  Hedges on this estate are
maintained tall asnd mostly
narrow, The sides being less often
cut than the top. Only one
hedge - E. of Slough Hall - has
been grubbed since 1973.
  Most straw has been burnt,
but carefully and withut damage
to hedges or trees.

DED. About 15% in this area.
Incidence very irregular. A hedge
of Upxg on the N. side of Hall
Wood has been largely killed oveer
several years.

Mny farmers in W. Suffolk
have been burning straw in the
last few days - including Mr
7955
Knox in MPW. They appear to 
have deliberately waited till
the landscape is less dry. Smoke
clouds visible at evening.

  Elderberries very abundant
this year, especially along the
Lavenham-Bury road. Picked
in quantity for jam. Fruit often 
small, Already much eaten

Well-digging.
The Ransons have a well in
the garden, filled in when the house
was first extended in 1951. Elliptical
[????plan] approx 4 ft x 3 ft 6 in.
lined with ordinary fairly .soft
bricks laid dry, 4 1/2" thick

Lining is rather irregular in
vertical profile. Fill in mostly
gravel, brickbats, household rub-
bish, & plants growing on the site.
Becomes anaerobic rather sud-
denly at 17 ft below ground.
Wood well preserved, blackened.
Remains aerobic at sides of
well against brickwork.

Sept. 11.
  Water was struck at 30'4".
The well at High Trees, which
is similar in construction but
rather larger has water at 8'
below ground (6' earlier in the 
summer); the ground is some 3 ft
lower than at Lavender Cottage.
