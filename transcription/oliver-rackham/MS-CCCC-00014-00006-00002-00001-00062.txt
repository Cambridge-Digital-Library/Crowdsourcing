[5056-5057]
5056
The pear tree bears
a heavy crop which is
ripening very unevenly.
A large part has al-
ready fallen off. There
is much damage by a 
soft brown rot which
usually does not detach
the fr. but sporulates
while the fr. is still on
the tree. Ripening and
size of frs are uneven
on different branches.
Many frs are badly dam-
aged or even half eaten
away by wasps, earwigs,
and flies, but it is dif-
ficult to say whether
these insects start holes.
Large flies sit in

5057
the sun on the newly
painted woodwork of 
the summerhouse and
chew the cud. When dis-
turbed they often leave
a large brown liquid
regurgitated blob behind.
They do not try to 
land on [!!!!] wet paint.
October 4. [DIAG]
A monstrous Mer-
curialis was found in
Queen-of-Hungary
yard (Sept. 26).
About 17" high (rather
unusually rigorous).
Stem exceotionally stout
(3.16") right from the
base. LVS do not oc-
cur singly, but in groups

[5058-5059]
5058
of about 10. In the
lower part of the plant,
each group forms a
whorl but with only two
axillay branches. Above,
each group of lvs forms
a half-whorl. The half-
-whorls roughtly alternate
but their phyllotaxis is 
irregular. Each has
one (or occasionally more) fl. [SYMBOL]. It is as
if each lf in the nor-
mal plant had become
transformed into a group
of lvs. The branches
are simple and resemble
the stem.
The apex of the
plant is somewhat dilated,

5059
and deeply torn into four
parts, each part of a cy-
linder. Each part clearly
has an apical meristem,
but the apex is grossly
twisted and deformed by
uneven growth. The stem
cavity appears to be
quite normal and there
is no trace of the 
central cone of ring
fasciations. It looks as
if the original apex
(like, apparently, those
of the branches) was
abnormal in its giant
size (enabling it to be
split by the tearing of
the tissues below) and
the nature and position

[5060-5061]
5060
of the appendages on it.
October 5.
Many curious growths
of Hypochoeris were found
on the lawns of Har-
vey Lane (Sept. 30). They
were most numerous
in the S.E. corner of
the back grass (where
nearly every plant was
affected) but occurred
elsewhere on the back
grass and front grass.
The grass has been
cut from time to time but
not very often.
The growths are inter-
mediate between lvs and
scapes. THey are of
limited growth and pos-

5061
sess laminae. On the
other hand, they are
usually trifid, cylindrical
at the base and often
for some distance upwards,
and arise centrally in
the rosette or somewhat
laterially.

October 6.
There is a considerable
outbreak of dry rot in a
built-in wardrobe in my
room at Fanshawe
House. The wardrobe
is in a corner of the
room between an outside
wall and a brick in-
side wall. The two 
skirtings pass through
the wardrobe.
Damage is almost confined to the inside
of the wardrobe. One
skirting=board is de-
stroyed apart from a
skin of about 1/16 in. thick
under the painted sur-
face. The rotted wood
is brown, light, dry,

[5064-5065]
5064
cracked mainly longitudin-
ally. The back surface
is rather firm. Above
the skirting, the wall-
paper has separated from the wall; the
separated paper is damp,
fragile, and backed
by a whitish thin inter-
[????]nyoted[????] mycelial sheet.
The plaster rendering
is bulging and partly
disintegrated. The rot
is apparently confined
to the wall; the floor
and the structure of the
wardrobe are only slightly
rotted, even where in con-
tact with the rotten
skirting and paper.

5065
Outside the wardrobe,
there is a small pocket
of rot on the outside
wall side, both in the 
skirting and wall. There 
is a little rot in the
skirting of the next
room.
A wooden bonding
course about 2 1/2 ft from
the floor appears to
have escaped attack
so far, though it can
only be a few in. in front
of the advancing mycelium
in the wallpaper.
Outside the house
is a rain-water gullet
which is in good con=
dition and appears to

[5066-5067]
5066
have been so for many
years. The wall is not
damp. The rot is said
the emanate from a
large tunnel under the 
house which communi-
cates with a well. Its 
presence is known and
it is regarded as hard-
less and incurable.
Obtober 7.
Two, pollard willows
on Sheep's Green are
showing serious die-
-back, about half of 
each being affected.
Each has a variety of
fungi on it.
October 8.
The big willow by

5067
Silver Street bridge is
shedding its lvs remar-
cably early.
October 9.
Curious hooting sounds
have been heard in the 
garden in the late
afternoon and through
much of the night.
They are series of short
hoots or screams, re-
peated at short inter-
vals. The sources
appear to move
about. At least two
of them have been 
heard.
October 10.
Further dry-rot dam-

[5068-5069]

age has been found on an outside wall
near the wardrobe.
The plaster rendering
is rapidly disintegrating.
