15 May.
Trumpington Fen.
Study of a possible con-
servation area at the Plant
Breeding Institute.
Very little remains of the
water-meadows, and what there
is is nearly all improved grass-
land cut for hay.
Area A is about 1/2 acre of
wet grassland rich in species,
rather sharply distinct from
the rest of the meadow
which is much drier and
improved. In recent years
it has been out for hay.
It possibly represents a grassy
island in the open field.
The whole meadow shows traces

[15826-15827]

of parallel ditches, now ob-
solete.
Ditch BB [!!!!] flows rather
strongly, and is probably fed
by springs from the chalk marl
in Far and Well-head Fields.
Leakage from this ditch un-
doubtedly keeps area A wet.
C is an obsolescent natural
watercourse lined with pollard
willows.
Across the river there
is improved grassland grazed by
cattle.
The linear pit across Well-
head and Far Fields is
lined with hawthorn and
rose scrub. Some Typha in the
pit. Slowly being filled in from
the S.W.

One of the mounds in
Edmundsole's is covered
with hawthorn scrub: the
others are ploughed save
for grassy banks round the
sides.
The grove around the
nearby spring-head survives.
The most remarkable
plant in this area is Eleo-
charis uniglumis, frequent
throughout A and [!!!!]extending
into the improved grassland.
Apparently the only Eleo-
charis here.
A is a mixed stand of
several co-dominant species
among which is Valeriana
dioica.

Poterium occurs in abun-

the coprolite pits at the P.B.I.
Sanguisorba was seen only
in the railway cutting, where
one plant occurs on the
N. facing slope near the Nuffield
steps, about 3ft from the bottom
of the cutting. This may be a [????]
line site; there is a small
willow nearby.
Some hawthorns in the
scrub beside the long coprolite
pit show oxyacanthoides char-
acters. The most extreme such
bush has almost complete
oxy leaf shape, intermediate
habit, and almost entirely
mono flowers (one seen with
branched style).
