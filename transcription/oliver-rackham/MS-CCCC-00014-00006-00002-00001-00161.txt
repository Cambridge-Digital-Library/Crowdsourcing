Betonica officianalis - herbarium
Lime
  Four stools found by the
boundary bank of "East
Maulkin's" compartment. Just
2169
into the old wood (i.e. N.W. of
the bank).  Stools about
4ft x 11/2ft, rather like
those of the main lime stand.
Close together without other
trees intervening.  Little ground
vegetation:  possibly an Anemone
area.
   The main area formerly exten-
ded across Main Ride:  a few
stools have been destroyed on the
other side.
  The double-ditched part
of the W. bank of Monks'
Park is the only place where
there is any trace ofn inner
ditch.
   Half-way along the "new"
St Clare Hsll ride is a circular

[12170-12171]
2170
glade about 10 yards across
with small oaks, both forms of
Populus tremula, deep bracken,
and Holcus mollis.  It resembles
the 2 glades at the oblique Ride
cross-roads.
   Old St Clare Ride is a very
prominent and complex earthwork,
mainly a bank and ditch, with
sharp bends.  The "pipe-line"
which runs along it for nearly
100 yads is similar to that near
Jinny's water.  It has  a square
brick 'well-head'.  The whole is said 
by Mrs Litchfield to be a device formerly
used to ensure a supply of foxes when
the hunt called.

Two pots of Ipomoea plants

Conopodium is abundant on
these western earthworks.  It
is a predominantly M area.
  The large maple about
20 yards at N.E. of the mouth
of the N.W. side (photographed 
some years ago) appears to be 
a boundary pollard.

   Birch is abundant in many
parts of the wood, especially
around the swamp.  Apparently
all verrucosa.
   Lychnis flos-cuculi is
abundant.
   Campanula trachelium usually
occurs as suppressed plants,
singly or in small groups.
Conopodium is mainmly sup-
2179
pressed but flowers freely in
places, especially along the w.
earthworks.
   The rides are extremely
wet with many deep mud[
holes, much blocked by fallen
trees.  The wood appears to 
have been little visited  and 
totally neglected this year.
   No Ulmus glabra seen.
   Aspen is uncommon.
   A few infls are formed
by the Carex of the main
swamp, which is certainly
riparia not acutiformis. (Specimen).
Although several square yards
are fully exposed, infls. are
not frequent.
   No deer tracks seen.

[12180-12181]2180
   Oxlips have completely
finished flowering.
   Juncus articulatus is very
abundant in most of the
rides.

   The Allium area is in
what appears to be old secondary
woodland (cf Hardwick) according
to the banks.
  Note that "pure" oxlip appears
to occur in an area with
definite R& F.
  No systematic explanation of
the distribution of hawthorns.
  The oxlip areas in the W.
of the wood are well-defined but
small and fragmented.
  The wood is quite wet, es-
2181
pecially in the oxlip areas.
Big pools of water on the rides,
usually devoid of vegetstion be-
cause in deep shade.  Mercury
chloroticv and dying in wet
hollows and channels in mer-
cury areas: [SYMBOL] 28.

  There is a small Phragmites
bed in the old railay cutting
alongside the
Nuffield barley [DIAG]
field.  Plants
short, but
dense and
some flowering last year.  Near
the bottom of the cutting,
presumably where a spring

line arises from the cutting
going through the gravel cap
and into underlying gault.  [SYMBOL] 33,

Thorpe Morieux Wood
(with Colin Ranson)
   Similar to Monks' Park,
porobably an ancient wood,
but poorer in species and much
less interesting.
  A rather dry wood, perhaps
because of the drainage grips;
  Standards rather dense in
places.  Almost entirely oak,
except in elm areas.  Trees
very irregularly spaced,
mostly pioneer habit, up to
2185
c. 80 years old.  Poles [!!!!]
less frequent than in MPW

frequent.
  Large & small coppice
now cut together.  Large
coppice includes some medium
sized oak stools (none very
large) and a few notable
elms.
Carr variant poorly repre-
sented.  No alder, or tree
willows.  Sallows occasional,
but not dominant.
   Hawthorn scarce and
both spp., as in MPW.
   Heathland represented
by a bracken area.  A
few small glades in the bracken

[12186-12187
2186
with oak and birch, but
most of the bracken is
under normal  coppice with
standards.  The heath variant
is thus much less extensive
and interesting that MPW
or even FHW.
  No bluebell as in MPW.
  Phosphatic plants rarer
than in FHW or MPW.
  No internal clearing
earthworks.
  Clematic present but 
rare, as in FHW.
   present but very rare.
  Conopodium locally abundant
as in FHW and MPW.
Carex pendula occurs but
rare
2187
Few plants (notably Carex
remota) occur here but  far
not in FHW or MPW.
Plants not yet found 
here include:
Bluebell
Allium ursinum
Primrose
Oxalis
Tilia cordata
Fragula

Luzula sylvatica

Coppicing [SYMBOL] 29
  The wood is said to be
owned by the Hunt.
  About 2 acres have been
coppiced this year in the 
middle of the N. half.  An
irregular clearing.  Oak
standards being rather thin,
some ash stools have been
promoted by leaving one pole
(as in FHW and MPW).
  Species cut:  mostly ash
and hazel, some birch (both
species).
  Current cut appears
to be 9 years old (i.e. last
cut 1959 - 60). Previous cut
probably -28 years before (i.e.
1931 - 2).
  Good regrowth. Ground vegetation
2189
now almost closed.
  The whole wood (except
elm and bracken areas
and other parts of the 
E.) has been coppiced within
the last 10 years.  Ground
vegetation consequently
difficult to see.
  Coppice is used for
thatching broaches, made in
a tin hut.  Growth somewhat
less vigorous than in MPW.
  The area round the
airfield concrete road is cleared
of bushes but otherwise not
much disturbed.
  No sign of deer in the wood.
  Geum appears to be all
rivale; no hybrids.

Stellaria graminea
Tilia cordata
Salix alba


The ivy suggests local dis-
turbance or clearing around
the outlet to Maulkin's.
  This area has been much
disturbed by grubbing.

  The ditch-bound strip
between this compartment
and the next is largely
grubbed and the lack of
large stools &c is not con-
clusive although there is 
no positive evidence of pri-
mary woodland.  Ditches do not
apparently continue across ride.
2205
S.W. Lobe
  Undoubted primary woodland.
  Ditch-bound with a substan-
tial inner bank.
  Positive evidence is mainly
Tilia cordata (one stool).
  Standards rather frequent,
small.
  Ash stools few, not more
than medium size.
  Mercury sparse and local.
  Much birch scrub.
  This is primary woodland
whose lack of characteristic
ground vegetation appears to
be mainly due to soil:
probable transition to heath
type ( though there is no
bracken).  Paris suggests


2206
disturbance (several plants).
  Lychnis is rather unex-
pected.
  Lazula sylvatica:  one
plant.
  S.E. edge of the compart-
ment destroyed and not re-
corded.  Much of the rest of
this area is badly damaged.

  An iron object like a
small sickle was found by
the intersection of the oblique
cross ride and the main
ride.
2207
  Ulmus glabra and elms
in rhe carpinifolia group
(including one with pendu-
lous twigs and epicormics,
probably campanifolia itself)
are frequent around houses
(e.g. Mudlen End) in the

   Wheat and barley in the
area are very variable in
quality and sometimes
stunted or chlorotic.

  The weeping ash in Great
St Msry's churchyard failed
to come into leaf.  Only one
branch has produced tiny
leaves.
  The large cedar of Lebanon
by Brookside is in poor con-
dition.  The leaves have died

of others, totalling about 1/5
of the tree.

Melampynum: about 6 plants

Elm:  the large one to the S.E.

at the top, and has been for
some years.
Milium effusum.  In quantity
between the pond & Pond Ride.

  A remarkable number of
trees in the coppice plots are 
dead or dying.  Some 30
promoted coppice poles show
severe symptoms [!!!!]

[12212-12213]
2212
Ash: many affected, a few
dead, the rest with very thin
crowns or crowns only on some
of the branches of a multiple
tree.
Hawthorn:  several affected.
Crab:  all the surviving promoted 
standards affected.
  Ashes and maples are 
most severely affected in the 
1967 and 1968 plots, but some
as far back as 1965 and 
even 1964.  The following are 
little affected:
Trees away from rhe coppice
plots (though one maple standard in the
N. section shows considerable 
crown-leaf shrinkage).
Oaks, poplars, sallows.
2213
Established standards.
Coppiced stools.
  Drought suddenly following
waterloigging is a possible
cause. Dead trees have
not unfolded their leaves
at all;  those damaged have
small leaves or leaves only
on some branches.
Standing water.
  None left in the Triangle,
where the ground is now quite
hard again.
  None on main rides: the
S.E. main ride, which had 
considerable sheet flow over
a length of several yards,
is quite dry.

  "Hayley Ditch" almost dry.
  Main Pond has gone down
