Betonica officianalis - herbarium
Lime
  Four stools found by the
boundary bank of "East
Maulkin's" compartment. Just
2169
into the old wood (i.e. N.W. of
the bank).  Stools about
4ft x 11/2ft, rather like
those of the main lime stand.
Close together without other
trees intervening.  Little ground
vegetation:  possibly an Anemone
area.
   The main area formerly exten-
ded across Main Ride:  a few
stools have been destroyed on the
other side.
  The double-ditched part
of the W. bank of Monks'
Park is the only place where
there is any trace ofn inner
ditch.
   Half-way along the "new"
St Clare Hsll ride is a circular

[12170-12171]
2170
glade about 10 yards across
with small oaks, both forms of
Populus tremula, deep bracken,
and Holcus mollis.  It resembles
the 2 glades at the oblique Ride
cross-roads.
   Old St Clare Ride is a very
prominent and complex earthwork,
mainly a bank and ditch, with
sharp bends.  The "pipe-line"
which runs along it for nearly
100 yads is similar to that near
Jinny's water.  It has  a square
brick 'well-head'.  The whole is said 
by Mrs Litchfield to be a device formerly
used to ensure a supply of foxes when
the hunt called.

Two pots of Ipomoea plants
were bought.
