Betonica officianalis - herbarium
Lime
  Four stools found by the
boundary bank of "East
Maulkin's" compartment. Just
2169
into the old wood (i.e. N.W. of
the bank).  Stools about
4ft x 11/2ft, rather like
those of the main lime stand.
Close together without other
trees intervening.  Little ground
vegetation:  possibly an Anemone
area.
   The main area formerly exten-
ded across Main Ride:  a few
stools have been destroyed on the
other side.
  The double-ditched part
of the W. bank of Monks'
Park is the only place where
there is any trace ofn inner
ditch.
   Half-way along the "new"
St Clare Hsll ride is a circular

[12170-12171]
2170
glade about 10 yards across
with small oaks, both forms of
Populus tremula, deep bracken,
and Holcus mollis.  It resembles
the 2 glades at the oblique Ride
cross-roads.
   Old St Clare Ride is a very
prominent and complex earthwork,
mainly a bank and ditch, with
sharp bends.  The "pipe-line"
which runs along it for nearly
100 yads is similar to that near
Jinny's water.  It has  a square
brick 'well-head'.  The whole is said 
by Mrs Litchfield to be a device formerly
used to ensure a supply of foxes when
the hunt called.
June 7.
Two pots of Ipomoea plants
were bought.

   There are about 12 plants
of Dipsacus at Little St Mary's,
all apparently healthy and free
of aphids.
Eversden Wood.
  Carex (either otrubae or vulpina)
in small quantity among tall
herbage near main cross-roads.
   Campanula trachelium occurs on
   the N. side of the E. peninsula.
   Veronica Beccabunga (specimen
checked) occurs in pools on the 
N.W. main ride.

Conopodium is abundant on
these western earthworks.  It
is a predominantly M area.
  The large maple about
20 yards at N.E. of the mouth
of the N.W. side (photographed 
some years ago) appears to be 
a boundary pollard.

   Birch is abundant in many
parts of the wood, especially
around the swamp.  Apparently
all verrucosa.
   Lychnis flos-cuculi is
abundant.
   Campanula trachelium usually
occurs as suppressed plants,
singly or in small groups.
Conopodium is mainmly sup-
2179
pressed but flowers freely in
places, especially along the w.
earthworks.
   The rides are extremely
wet with many deep mud[
holes, much blocked by fallen
trees.  The wood appears to 
have been little visited  and 
totally neglected this year.
   No Ulmus glabra seen.
   Aspen is uncommon.
   A few infls are formed
by the Carex of the main
swamp, which is certainly
riparia not acutiformis. (Specimen).
Although several square yards
are fully exposed, infls. are
not frequent.
   No deer tracks seen.

[12180-12181]2180
   Oxlips have completely
finished flowering.
   Juncus articulatus is very
abundant in most of the
rides.

   The Allium area is in
what appears to be old secondary
woodland (cf Hardwick) according
to the banks.
  Note that "pure" oxlip appears
to occur in an area with
definite R& F.
  No systematic explanation of
the distribution of hawthorns.
  The oxlip areas in the W.
of the wood are well-defined but
small and fragmented.
  The wood is quite wet, es-
2181
pecially in the oxlip areas.
Big pools of water on the rides,
usually devoid of vegetstion be-
cause in deep shade.  Mercury
chloroticv and dying in wet
hollows and channels in mer-
cury areas: [SYMBOL] 28.
June 14
  There is a small Phragmites
bed in the old railay cutting
alongside the
Nuffield barley [DIAG]
field.  Plants
short, but
dense and
some flowering last year.  Near
the bottom of the cutting,
presumably where a spring

[12182-12183]
2182
line arises from the cutting
going through the gravel cap
and into underlying gault.  [SYMBOL] 33,
34.
  Great masses of shiny black
caterpillars with stiff bristles
all along their length are de-
vouring the leaves of stinging net-
tles by the experimental site.

Thorpe Morieux Wood
(with Colin Ranson)
   Similar to Monks' Park,
porobably an ancient wood,
but poorer in species and much
less interesting.
  A rather dry wood, perhaps
because of the drainage grips;
  Standards rather dense in
places.  Almost entirely oak,
except in elm areas.  Trees
very irregularly spaced,
mostly pioneer habit, up to
2185
c. 80 years old.  Poles [!!!!]
less frequent than in MPW
thought saplings are fairly
frequent.
  Large & small coppice
now cut together.  Large
coppice includes some medium
sized oak stools (none very
large) and a few notable
elms.
Carr variant poorly repre-
sented.  No alder, or tree
willows.  Sallows occasional,
but not dominant.
   Hawthorn scarce and
both spp., as in MPW.
   Heathland represented
by a brscken area.  A
few small glades in the broken
