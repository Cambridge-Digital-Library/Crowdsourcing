Elm mainly (not exclusively)
U. glabra; some suckers.
Elms form a loose canopy 
with ash and oak; no sign
that the latter are shaded
out. Hazel frequent, not
properly coppiced.
Mid-west elm area.
No obvious ridge and furrow.
Elm contains a larger
proportion of U. carpinifolia
and suckers more densely.
Very sharp eastern edge,
but no boundary ditch,
though three large and
very decayed elms may
possibly mark an old
boundary.
Northern elm area. (The
Plantation). Scattered elm,

[8588-8589]
8588

mainly U. [!!!!]carpinifolia[!!!!] glabra, some
with pioneer habit. Coppice
with a strong tendency to
rows parallel to the wood
edge. Oaks also present.
This passes rather abruptly
at the S. end into the den-
ser forest of the last sec-
tion. The kink in the
wood boundary has dis-
appeared: this probably re-
[DIAG]  sulted from
a driftway

Such a drift, and a fairly
massive ditch, can be seen
in the Plantation.
Old Wood. Distinguishable
by:
No ridge and furrow
Abundant oaks of tall
narrow habit with clean
trunks
Abundant large hazel stools
Occasional maple.
Ditches. Several indistinct
ones.
The largest runs diagonally

The pond is a sausage
shape with a small side arm
and a ditch connecting it
to the edge of the wood.
It is about 4ft deep though
only about 17ft wide.
There is no standing water
anywhere in the wood, not
even in the pond.
Ivy. In small quantities
everywhere; most abundant
on ridge and furrow.
Stumps. Few. No sign of
wartime logging. No oak
tops lying around.

November 24.
The frost has done no
visible damage to Impatiens
parviflora or Cotyledon decus-

A large oak in the N.

has the bark all loose on

8599

one side, with much rotten
debris underneath. This runs
up to a large dead branch.
A few old rhizomorphs were
found in the rubbish under
the bark. This probably repre-
sents an old attack which
damaged but did not kill the
tree.

A clearing was made
of about 30 yards length
of birch and poplar scrub
which had encroached on
the Meadow from the
adjoining Great Heath Plan-
tation. The trees were
felled and the logs sawn
up and left as a wood
pile. Birch up to 15 years
old, to c. 4 in. diam.
The "Heath Plantation"
is mainly birch scrub, with
some oak, but there is
a large area of bare ground
at its E. side. This is dom-
inated by bracken. Very
large and old gorse and
broom bushes grew on
it. A fire earlier this year

8605

destroyed most of the
gorse and almost all
the broom, and there is
no sign of regeneration so
far. The area is not
immediately menaced by
trees. Rumex tenuifolius
is abundant on the ground
cleared by fire.
Broom is abundant
and flourishing at the N.W.
corner of the Heath Plan-
tation.
The bottom edge of
the Greensand is well
inside the Heath Meadow
and is a clearly visible
terrace. The change
which would be ex-
pected in the vegetation

[8606-8607]
8606

is obscured by the develop-
ment of scrub and by the
occurrence of springs. Some
attempt seems to have
been made to cope with
the latter by digging the
boundary ditch and by
running grips downhill from
it.
A square foot or so
of Polytrichum formosum
grows under birch. A few
trees were left uncut to
protect it.
Sphagnum was searched
for among the rushes in the
E. part of the meadow,
but without success.
Ceratodon is abundant
on the site of the fire.

8607

412. Atrichum undulatum oc-
curs in the Heath Plantation.
413. Pellia epiphylla is abun-
dant on the sides of
the boundary ditch to the
Heath Plantation.
The poplars in the
Heath Meadow appear to
be P. tremula derived by
suckers from trees on the
edge of the boundary ditch.
There is very little under-
growth in the Heath Wood,
which has a high density
of swine. They root in
the earth by burying their
snouts for about 6in. and
then walking forwards to
plough a furrow.

December 6.
The great lime tree by
the back gate of Clare has
been felled. The stump

but showed no sign of Ar-
millaria.
December 7.
The river level is now

December 10.
Passiflora continues to

December 11.
The river rose further
after heavy rain, and
slightly overflowed at the
rollers. It came within an
inch of overflowing the

The Royal Engineers have
done some preliminary

The New Ride has proved
impossible to drain, even
with many grips and
with a pump running con-
tinually. It is now a morass.
The pond nearest the rail-
way is now full, but prob-

8611

ably would not have been

ped into it.
The main pond was
temporarily pumped out,
revealing that a lot of
mud and silt is still in
it.
Water flows all the
way along the N.W. ride,
but not along the S.W. or
S.E. rides. Two small streams
cross the latter.
There is little surface
water in the S. section,
apart from a few wet hol-
lows in the upper part
and a pool in the Glade.
Little obvious surface flow.
Almost the whole non-mer-

[8612-8613]
8612

cury area in the swamp is
under water, a series of
shallow pools (seldom more
than 6in. deep). A strong flow
is visble in the W. part, which
finds its way out as a
strong stream through a
gap in the boundary ditch.
This flow was stronger in
the recent past, as shown
by leaves and debris accumu-
lated against trees and
bushes.
At X was found the
remains of a small bonfire

but some heather. There
is some much-disturbed open
ground S. of Salhouse Road

[8620-8621]
8620

but no true heath. Birch
scrub is much the most fre-
quent vegetation; even those
areas which are still open
have abundant trees 2-3
years old. Fires are too
small (probably put out
by the fire brigade) and
infrequent, so that much
of the existing gorse is over-
-mature.
Oaks are local, mainly
small and of pioneer habit.
There is good oak scrub
near the Heartsease Lane
junction. Holly is occasional
in it.
Small areas of brambly

gale which uprooted all
the big trees; a number
of the standing trees survived,
but were all small at the
time. Some big oaks on
the W. side were recently
felled to accommodate power
lines; this has let the wind
into the wood, and a
recent S.W. gale felled two
birches and decapitated
another.
Beech is frequent in the
Wood and grows fast.
There is a large dead
hornbeam in the lane
outside the house.
Rhododendron ponticum
has been planted near the
N. side of the Wood, but

8625

is kept under rigorous
control. It regenerates from
stumps and produces
many seedlings, mostly near
the parent.
When a Rhododendron
thicket was felled, some
hornbeam trees 2in.diam.
were revealed which had
grown up inside it.
Birch logs take 21
years to disappear completely
when lying in the ground
at the edge of the wood.
The lawn in front of

to the surface; there is no
peat.
One of the great
cherry laurels in the Wod

[8626-8627]

has an aerial root several
feet long running to the
ground, probably induced by
a wound.
High tides have recently
proved very disastrous to
the inner marshes and the
pools therein, partly because
polluted water has got in.
To remedy this, a medi-
eval peat-baulk (The Cause-
way) running N.E. across
the middle of the system
is to be built up and a
gap closed, to cut off the
inner marshes completely.
It passes between two
very deep pools with no
sign of Verlandung and
is difficult to repair be-

8627

cause of the extreme dif-
ficulty of getting materials
to it.

Ganoderma applanatum.

Birch V.ab.
Oak (pioneer habit)
Elm (U. carpinifolia & glabra)
Hawthorn occasional

in the night, forming a
layer of about 2in.
The Town Moor of New-

[8636-8637]

castle appears to be entirely
grassland.
January 6.
The snow persisted all
day.
Jnauary 7.
The weather in Newcastle
was remarkable: warm,
damp, with no actual rain
and little fog, but so dark
at 11 a.m. that vehicles
had to drive with headlamps;
probably because of fog
trapped in an upper layer
of air.
About 3in. of snow
lie in Cambs.
Small areas of scrub
exist in the Colne district,
Hunts.

Jnauary 8.   [DIAG]
The hard frost continued.
At Coton, wallflowers
are flowering.
Remarkable dendritic
ice crystals were seen
at Coton on concrete and
on mud on tractor tyres.
In the latter case, the
crystals grew in the
surface mud in fine
curvilinear patterns, the
ice then evaporating to leave
a groove in the mud where
it had been.
The Evanses have a
remarkable apple, which
looks as if mummified, but
is hard and polished as
though silicified, but is lighter

[8638-8639]
8638

than a living apple.
January 9.
A rapid thaw followed by
a very cold night.

Hayley Wood.
About 1[SYMBOL] in. of partly
melted snow remain in the
Wood.
Many rabbit tracks were
seen, but only two solitary
deer tracks (see map).
Pond has not quite re-
filled after draining. Second
pond (in W. section) is full
and Clive Raven says it
has been for about 3 weeks.
Few ash stools in the
W. section have more than
2 trunks.

The ice on the pond is
not quite strong enough to
walk on.
A remarkable ice formation
was seen on a frozen
cart-rut in the pond ride.
The ice is about 1 in. thick
including the snow crust.

Attached to the underside
are curious laminated
blocks of ice, rectangular
in vertical section (though
sometimes stepped below),
curvilinear in plan. They
may be canoed by water
currents under the ice.
January 11.
It was just possible
to walk on the ice of Queens'
Backs, though somebody
appears to have gone through.
January 12.
The Aloe inflorescence

8641

is elongating and the flowers,
at first erect, are becoming
horizontal. It bears four
small bracts with   [DIAG]
green midribs and
very broad scarious
margins at the
base. There are 8
flowers and a
tuft of bracts at the
top among which are about
9 probably abortive buds.
January 13.
The moat in the interior
of New-Hall is planted with
various hygrophytes in sub-
merged pots. It is full
of algae and contains some
large goldfish.

The Stour has recently
overflowed its banks at
Cavendish, W. Suffolk.
On the Green at Long
Melford are three great
elms, probably U. procera.
About 5ft diam. Two are
probably over 100ft high,
the third is broken off.

1. Pleurotus ulmarius. A
group of three high on
one of these elms. Centrally
stalked. P. convex, pale buff,
appendiculate margin. S.
cylindric, yellow. L. ochre,
subdecurrent.

Among the many iron

8643

monuments in the churchyard
is an iron tomb with a
double-pitched slab. The
surface is incrusted with a
white lichen, which has cracked
into areoles, which have steadily
[DIAG]
become more prominent and
more separated with the
rusting of the iron.   [SYMBOL]
The great avenue of
Kentwell Hall is said to have
been planted in 1678. The
trees (hybrid[????]s[????]) were pollarded
long ago and since have
grown very tall, with 3-4
trunks each from the short
crown. Only a few show any

[8644-8645]
864[!!!!]4

sign of decay.
Mistletoe is abundant
on these limes.
