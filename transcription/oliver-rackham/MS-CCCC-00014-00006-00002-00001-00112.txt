Tha Clianthus is still
growing very slowly.

8581

Two small fragments of
Cotyledon decussata (ex dono
Petr: et Eliz: Warenn:) were
potted in individual pots.

Hardwick Wood. General sur-
vey with Joan Wilson.
No standing water was
observed anywhere in the
wood.
Extreme S.W. corner. Mixed,
with some Ulmus glabra.
One very large beech
(struck by lightning long
ago, and with two great
helical wounds down the
trunk); branches low
and horizontal on the
S. side. No ridge and furrow.

Ridged area in S.W.
Definite ridge and furrow.
There is a suggestion of
two parallel ditches, 11 paces
apart, at 29[SYMBOL] mag., but
these are difficult to distin-
guish from the ridge and
furrow to which they are parallel.

Elm mainly (not exclusively)
U. glabra; some suckers.
Elms form a loose canopy 
with ash and oak; no sign
that the latter are shaded
out. Hazel frequent, not
properly coppiced.
Mid-west elm area.
No obvious ridge and furrow.
Elm contains a larger
proportion of U. carpinifolia
and suckers more densely.
Very sharp eastern edge,
but no boundary ditch,
though three large and
very decayed elms may
possibly mark an old
boundary.
Northern elm area. (The
Plantation). Scattered elm,

[8588-8589]
8588

mainly U. [!!!!]carpinifolia[!!!!] glabra, some
with pioneer habit. Coppice
with a strong tendency to
rows parallel to the wood
edge. Oaks also present.
This passes rather abruptly
at the S. end into the den-
ser forest of the last sec-
tion. The kink in the
wood boundary has dis-
appeared: this probably re-
[DIAG]  sulted from
a driftway
along the edge
of the wood
which was for-
merly free when
it came to the
Plantation but is
now completely overgrown.

8589

Such a drift, and a fairly
massive ditch, can be seen
in the Plantation.
Old Wood. Distinguishable
by:
No ridge and furrow
Abundant oaks of tall
narrow habit with clean
trunks
Abundant large hazel stools
Occasional maple.
Ditches. Several indistinct
ones.
The largest runs diagonally
across the wood, in three
straight stretches with two
gradual bends and one.
very sharp. Little trace of
any bank. It ends in
a hollow near which

is a curious pentagonal en-
closure (one angle re entrant',
surrounded by ditches about
2ft seep.
The pond is a sausage
shape with a small side arm
and a ditch connecting it
to the edge of the wood.
It is about 4ft deep though
only about 17ft wide.
There is no standing water
anywhere in the wood, not
even in the pond.
Ivy. In small quantities
everywhere; most abundant
on ridge and furrow.
Stumps. Few. No sign of
wartime logging. No oak
tops lying around.
Mercury. Much of it very

waterlogged and rotting; no
sign of frost damage.
Oxlip. Leaves frequent.
Rabbit. One seen. Droppings
frequent on occasional
fallen logs.

1. Once seen on fallen
hazel twigs. 1[SYMBOL]-1-[SYMBOL].
Remarkably leathery. A large
group. P. hygrophanous, rich
chestnut brown with whit-
ish flecks when wet,
dull purplish brown when
dry, marbled with darker
reticulate grooves, very bullete,
dry, matt, with a pronounced
buff centre in which is a 
hole.
S. slightly tapered below,

black with a strong buff to-
mentum especially at the
top, hard, corky, dry, hollow,

open at the top.
L. thin, distant, adnate,
narrow, with buttress veins,
grayish cream, fawn near
margin.
C. thin, papery, fungus
smell with a trace of garlic.

Marasmius fretidus. Certain.

November 21.
Nothing whatever has been
seen of the expected unusual
Leonid meteor shower.
November 22.
Despite heavy rains the
river is little altered in level
or colour.
November 23.
The first severe frost,

[8596-8597]
8596

which froze the tops of the
soil in plant-pots on the
balcony.
November 24.
The frost has done no
visible damage to Impatiens
parviflora or Cotyledon decus-
sata standing against the 
wall, although ice crystals
formed on the Impatiens
leaves and the soil in the
Cotyledon pots froze. Passiflora
is also undamaged although
much more exposed.
November 25.
The Clematis is still flower-
ing.
November 26.
Eccremocarpos scaber still
flourishes.
