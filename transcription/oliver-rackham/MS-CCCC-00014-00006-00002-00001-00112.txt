Two small fragments of

potted in individual pots.

Hardwick Wood. General sur-

No standing water was
observed anywhere in the
wood.
Extreme S.W. corner. Mixed,
with some Ulmus glabra.
One very large beech

Elm mainly (not exclusively)
U. glabra; some suckers.
Elms form a loose canopy 
with ash and oak; no sign
that the latter are shaded
out. Hazel frequent, not
properly coppiced.
Mid-west elm area.
No obvious ridge and furrow.
Elm contains a larger
proportion of U. carpinifolia
and suckers more densely.
Very sharp eastern edge,
but no boundary ditch,
though three large and
very decayed elms may
possibly mark an old
boundary.
Northern elm area. (The
Plantation). Scattered elm,

[8588-8589]
8588

mainly U. [!!!!]carpinifolia[!!!!] glabra, some
with pioneer habit. Coppice
with a strong tendency to
rows parallel to the wood
edge. Oaks also present.
This passes rather abruptly
at the S. end into the den-
ser forest of the last sec-
tion. The kink in the
wood boundary has dis-
appeared: this probably re-
[DIAG]  sulted from
a driftway
along the edge
of the wood
which was for-
merly free when
it came to the
Plantation but is
now completely overgrown.

8589

Such a drift, and a fairly
massive ditch, can be seen
in the Plantation.
Old Wood. Distinguishable
by:
No ridge and furrow
Abundant oaks of tall
narrow habit with clean
trunks
Abundant large hazel stools
Occasional maple.
Ditches. Several indistinct
ones.
The largest runs diagonally
across the wood, in three
straight stretches with two
gradual bends and one.
very sharp. Little trace of
any bank. It ends in
a hollow near which

[8592-8593]

is a curious pentagonal en-
closure (one angle re entrant',
surrounded by ditches about
2ft seep.
The pond is a sausage
shape with a small side arm
and a ditch connecting it
to the edge of the wood.
It is about 4ft deep though
only about 17ft wide.
There is no standing water
anywhere in the wood, not
even in the pond.
Ivy. In small quantities
everywhere; most abundant
on ridge and furrow.
Stumps. Few. No sign of
wartime logging. No oak
tops lying around.
Mercury. Much of it very

8593

waterlogged and rotting; no
sign of frost damage.
Oxlip. Leaves frequent.
Rabbit. One seen. Droppings
frequent on occasional
fallen logs.

1. Once seen on fallen
hazel twigs. 1[SYMBOL]-1-[SYMBOL].
Remarkably leathery. A large
group. P. hygrophanous, rich
chestnut brown with whit-

dull purplish brown when
dry, marbled with darker
reticulate grooves, very bullete,
dry, matt, with a pronounced

Marasmius fretidus. Certain.

November 21.
Nothing whatever has been
seen of the expected unusual
Leonid meteor shower.
November 22.
Despite heavy rains the
river is little altered in level
or colour.
November 23.
The first severe frost,

[8596-8597]
8596

which froze the tops of the
soil in plant-pots on the
balcony.
November 24.
The frost has done no
visible damage to Impatiens
parviflora or Cotyledon decus-
sata standing against the 
wall, although ice crystals
formed on the Impatiens
leaves and the soil in the
Cotyledon pots froze. Passiflora
is also undamaged although
much more exposed.

A large oak in the N.
section (near several dead ones)
has the bark all loose on

8599

one side, with much rotten
debris underneath. This runs
up to a large dead branch.
A few old rhizomorphs were
found in the rubbish under
the bark. This probably repre-
sents an old attack which
damaged but did not kill the
tree.
[DIAG]

Two small coppice oaks
occur in the 1967 plot
(both suppressed).
1. A large stump with two

2. A very large stump, en-
tirely rotted away except

November 27.
Cotyledon decussata has
in fact taken severe damage
from frost. One cutting is
dead and the other has
lost most of its leaves,
which go water-soaked.
November 28.
One Impatiens plant is
still alive.
November 29.
The Heracleum mantegaz-
zianum has died off completely,

8601

the last part to go being

November 30.
Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus
has got into the [!!!!]fron[!!!!] small
lawn recently established
to the N. of the house at
Leckhampton.

Fomes annosus has come
up on the stump of one

A clearing was made
of about 30 yards length
of birch and poplar scrub
which had encroached on
the Meadow from the
adjoining Great Heath Plan-
tation. The trees were
felled and the logs sawn
up and left as a wood
pile. Birch up to 15 years
old, to c. 4 in. diam.
The "Heath Plantation"
is mainly birch scrub, with
some oak, but there is
a large area of bare ground
at its E. side. This is dom-
inated by bracken. Very
large and old gorse and
broom bushes grew on
it. A fire earlier this year

8605

destroyed most of the
gorse and almost all
the broom, and there is
no sign of regeneration so
far. The area is not
immediately menaced by
trees. Rumex tenuifolius
is abundant on the ground
cleared by fire.
Broom is abundant
and flourishing at the N.W.
corner of the Heath Plan-
tation.
The bottom edge of
the Greensand is well
inside the Heath Meadow
and is a clearly visible
terrace. The change
which would be ex-
pected in the vegetation

[8606-8607]
8606

is obscured by the develop-
ment of scrub and by the
occurrence of springs. Some
attempt seems to have
been made to cope with
the latter by digging the
boundary ditch and by
running grips downhill from
it.
A square foot or so
of Polytrichum formosum
grows under birch. A few
trees were left uncut to
protect it.
Sphagnum was searched
for among the rushes in the
E. part of the meadow,
but without success.
Ceratodon is abundant
on the site of the fire.

8607

412. Atrichum undulatum oc-
curs in the Heath Plantation.
413. Pellia epiphylla is abun-
dant on the sides of
the boundary ditch to the
Heath Plantation.
The poplars in the
Heath Meadow appear to
be P. tremula derived by
suckers from trees on the
edge of the boundary ditch.
There is very little under-
growth in the Heath Wood,
which has a high density
of swine. They root in
the earth by burying their
snouts for about 6in. and
then walking forwards to
plough a furrow.

The elm in Leckhampton
which was constricted by an
iron band has now recovered
its proper state, and only
the damage to the outer
bark remains.
December 5.
The river is now rather
high.
December 6.
The great lime tree by
the back gate of Clare has
been felled. The stump
was slightly heart-rotted
but showed no sign of Ar-
millaria.
December 7.
The river level is now
about 1 in. below the sill
by the rollers opposite the

8609

Garden House.
December 8.
Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus
flourishes greatly in the
rough grass of Leckhampton,
especially at the far end.
December 9.
Eccremocarpos continues to
grow slowly.
December 10.
Passiflora continues to
grow, and has produced
a number of small thickish
leaves.
December 11.
The river rose further
after heavy rain, and
slightly overflowed at the
rollers. It came within an
inch of overflowing the

[8610-8611]
8610

path between the King's and
Bishop's Mills, thus covering
about [SYMBOL] of Sheep's Green. It
went down in a few hours.

The Royal Engineers have
done some preliminary
surveying and testing of
methods for road making.
The New Ride has proved
impossible to drain, even
with many grips and
with a pump running con-
tinually. It is now a morass.
The pond nearest the rail-
way is now full, but prob-

8611

ably would not have been
if water had not been pum-
ped into it.
The main pond was
temporarily pumped out,
revealing that a lot of
mud and silt is still in
it.
Water flows all the
way along the N.W. ride,
but not along the S.W. or
S.E. rides. Two small streams
cross the latter.
There is little surface
water in the S. section,
apart from a few wet hol-
lows in the upper part
and a pool in the Glade.
Little obvious surface flow.
Almost the whole non-mer-

[8612-8613]
8612

cury area in the swamp is
under water, a series of
shallow pools (seldom more
than 6in. deep). A strong flow
is visble in the W. part, which
finds its way out as a
strong stream through a
gap in the boundary ditch.
This flow was stronger in
the recent past, as shown
by leaves and debris accumu-
lated against trees and
bushes.
At X was found the
remains of a small bonfire
with 2 X 1 gallon tins of para-
ffin.

Mousehold.
Very little undisturbed
open heath remains: confined
to a few acres in the middle
of the N. section. Mainly gorse
but some heather. There
is some much-disturbed open
ground S. of Salhouse Road

[8620-8621]
8620

but no true heath. Birch
scrub is much the most fre-
quent vegetation; even those
areas which are still open
have abundant trees 2-3
years old. Fires are too
small (probably put out
by the fire brigade) and
infrequent, so that much
of the existing gorse is over-
-mature.
Oaks are local, mainly
small and of pioneer habit.
There is good oak scrub
near the Heartsease Lane
junction. Holly is occasional
in it.
Small areas of brambly
heath occur N.E. of Hearts-
ease Lane. Oaks among
