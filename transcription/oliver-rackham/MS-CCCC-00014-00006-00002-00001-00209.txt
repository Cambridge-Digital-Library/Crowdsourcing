Cambridge Antiquarian Society's
Excursion.
West Stow Hall.
Hinderclay Wood.  Much of it
appears still to survive.
Framlingham.

     Heveningham Park.
   Capability Brown's "before &
after" plan hung in the house.
The "before" plan shows many
ancient oaks and ancient
thorns.  The alterations appear
to be mainly the making of the
garden S. of the house, the enlarg-
ing of the lake, and the planting
of groves arounbd the lake and
N.E. of the house.  No evidence
of any effect on the more remote

[16274-16275]
6274
parts of the park.
  Several of the pre-Brown oaks
survive:  mostly pollards of slow
growth and massive girth.  A few
pre-Brown thorns are still there:
they have seversl massive trunks
which fall outwards and rest on
the ground.  Many oaks and other
trees appear to be 18th and 19th
cent.  The park S. of the huse is
mostly arable and plantation but
many pre-1700 pollards and other oaks
survive.
  On Brown's "before" plan the park
comes down to the river, but a bank
roughly on the line of the footpath
appears to mark the former edge of the
meadow.
  Mistletoe on ancient thorns.

  The railway side opposite
the S. end of Quendon W.

erata.
Elm Disease.
  Little or none in the

slight to moderate infection of

severe than last year.

Cambridge to Trumpington:
last year's focus around the
lopped elms on the W. side of
the road has increased and
several other trees are now severely
affected.

  The Pigott-Lloyd field is the
area marked "Range" at 829053.
It is still only abut 1/10 covered
with scattered hawthorn and
rose bushes, to some degree kept
down by rabbits, though this seems
not to be severe enought wholly
to account for their lack of 
spread.
  Beeches on steep slopes at
Pulpit Hill are quite severely
chlorotic - [SYMBOL] 16.
Considerable public use, but
probably has little effect on the 
vegetation.

  Lesser ditch said to have
been made by the Jockey
Club c. 1800 to obstruct the

  For half the way from Cam-
bridge to Well Gap the Ditch

Elm Disease - Cambridge to 
Grantchester
  Elm clumps on W. side
of Grantchester Road, on last
bend towards Grantchester (where
some trees felled last year).
One pole-sized tree at W.
end almost dead.  No earlier
symptoms elsewhere in group,
tho' one tree to the W. of the
felling gap may have some
dead branches to the S.
  Very severe outbreak in
Grantchesteer Meadows.  Centred 
on gate at N. end of the
footpath across the meadows.

hedge affected, of which haif dead.
E: grove of pole-sized suckering
elms.  About 1/2 affected of
which half dead.  The meadow
in which these grow has lately
(c. 12 months) been enclosed
with a chain-link fence
and heavily grazed with
horses, which have eaten
much of the bark of the elms,
but there appears to be no
correlation with crown symp-
toms.
F: several elms severely
affected.
Lepiota procera. One found
in Leckhampton by Mrs Mc
Burney, who fried it in but-

  Inoculatiion not very
successful on sites on which
Fomis is  already well established
