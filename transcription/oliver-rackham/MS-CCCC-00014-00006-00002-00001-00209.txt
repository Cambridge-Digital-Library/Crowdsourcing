Cambridge Antiquarian Society's
Excursion.
West Stow Hall.
Hinderclay Wood.  Much of it
appears still to survive.
Framlingham.

     Heveningham Park.
   Capability Brown's "before &
after" plan hung in the house.
The "before" plan shows many
ancient oaks and ancient
thorns.  The alterations appear
to be mainly the making of the
garden S. of the house, the enlarg-
ing of the lake, and the planting
of groves around the lake and
N.E. of the house.  No evidence
of any effect on the more remote

[16274-16275]
6274
parts of the park.
  Several of the pre-Brown oaks
survive:  mostly pollards of slow
growth and massive girth.  A few
pre-Brown thorns are still there:
they have several massive trunks
which fall outwards and rest on
the ground.  Many oaks and other
trees appear to be 18th and 19th
cent.  The park S. of the house is
mostly arable and plantation but
many pre-1700 pollards and other oaks
survive.
  On Brown's "before" plan the park
comes down to the river, but a bank
roughly on the line of the footpath
appears to mark the former edge of the
meadow.
  Mistletoe on ancient thorns.

  The Pigott-Lloyd field is the
area marked "Range" at 829053.
It is still only about 1/10 covered
with scattered hawthorn and
rose bushes, to some degree kept
down by rabbits, though this seems
not to be severe enough wholly
to account for their lack of 
spread.
  Beeches on steep slopes at
Pulpit Hill are quite severely
chlorotic - [SYMBOL] 16.
Considerable public use, but
probably has little effect on the
