6 July.          1973
Cambridge Antiquarian Society's
Excursion.
West Stow Hall.
Hinderclay Wood.  Much of it
appears still to survive.
Framlingham.

     Heveningham Park.
   Capability Brown's "before &
after" plan hung in the house.
The "before" plan shows many
ancient oaks and ancient
thorns.  The alterations appear
to be mainly the making of the
garden S. of the house, the enlarg-
ing of the lake, and the planting
of groves arounbd the lake and
N.E. of the house.  No evidence
of any effect on the more remote

[16274-16275]

parts of the park.
  Several of the pre-Brown oaks
survive:  mostly pollards of slow
growth and massive girth.  A few
pre-Brown thorns are still there:
they have seversl massive trunks
which fall outwards and rest on
the ground.  Many oaks and other
trees appear to be 18th and 19th
cent.  The park S. of the huse is
mostly arable and plantation but
many pre-1700 pollards and other oaks
survive.
  On Brown's "before" plan the park
comes down to the river, but a bank
roughly on the line of the footpath
appears to mark the former edge of the
meadow.
  Mistletoe on ancient thorns.

  The railway side opposite
the S. end of Quendon W.
is full of Campanula glom-
erata.
Elm Disease.
  Little or none in the 
parish of Quendon and to
the north.
  Stansted:  about 1/5 of trees with
slight to moderate infection of
the branch-by-branch type.
A few severe.  Affects wood-
land & hedge elms, including
some killing attacks in the
interior of Alsa Wood.  More
severe than last year.

Elm Disease.
Cambridge to Trumpington:
last year's focus around the
lopped elms on the W. side of
the road has increased and
several other trees are now severely
affected.
Trumpington slight to moderate
disease freq.
Foxton: slight disease freq.
Shepreth) none, tho' many gxc

fected, 3% standing dead.
A few trees severely damaged

elms in open country more
often severely damaged than
elms in rows or in the town.

  The Pigott-Lloyd field is the
area marked "Range" at 829053.
It is still only abut 1/10 covered
with scattered hawthorn and
rose bushes, to some degree kept
down by rabbits, though this seems
not to be severe enought wholly
to account for their lack of 
spread.
  Beeches on steep slopes at
Pulpit Hill are quite severely
chlorotic - [SYMBOL] 16.
Considerable public use, but
probably has little effect on the 
vegetation.

Lodge Wood, Prestwood.
  Yellow colour of loess clearly
visible in soil pit.  Somewhat gleyed

fosse, very scattered small ones
in the bank.
  Lesser ditch said to have
been made by the Jockey
Club c. 1800 to obstruct the

robbing the Ditch (tho' this is
not obvious).  [SYMBOL] 18.

  For half the way from Cam-
bridge to Well Gap the Ditch
is about 12ft wide at the top
not obviously thro' robbing.  Some
chalk stones exposd on the
path.  A section c. 18 in. high
is exposed in the Camb. Gap.

Apparently no chalk fragments
in the ancient soil (at least not
above the snail layer.)
  Hypochaeris maculata -

sion of layers of different kinds
of chalk debris dumped over the
buried soil and turf bank.
  One turf visible which
was never incorporated into the turf
bank but remained lying about
and was later buried by the
chalk rubble.
