Geology. Most of    [DIAG]
the thickness is 
Lower Urgonian, 
n4U, massive 
white limestone,
which forms the 
great cliffs. The 
lower limestone
is not stratified but strongly 
fissured vertically [SYMBOL]10; the iron ladder 
passes through one of these fissures. 
The upper portion is increasingly 
stratified giving rise to small ledges. 
The n50 is not very easily seen, 
because covered with talus; it 
gives rise to small cliff-lines on the 
plateau, and to breaks in the great 
cliffs [SYMBOL]21.   (Upper Urgonian)
    n5U [SYMBOL] forms parts of the 
Granier plateau; it is stratified
like the upper n4U. It also forms
the rocky part of the Alpe[!!!!] plateau, 
and overhangs the n50 giving the 
Roches de Belles-Ombres. 
   All the limestone where exposed 
is deeply fissured with grykes. 
   About a third of the Granier 
plateau is covered with what 
appears to be loess: fine yellow
soil. The loess is always grassy 
without trees, while the limestone 
is covered, sometimes thinly, with 
trees and bushes (more extensive 
than the map shows). A similar 
distinction exists on the Alpe, 

[17352-17353]
where the fine grassland appears 
to be on loess (mapped as 
C6-7M, "craie marneuse" of Upper 
Cretaceous, and n6L, Upper Aptian), 
while the open forest is on bare 
limestone. 
   Dolines are fairly frequent on 
the Granier plateau and the Alpe, 
and in both cases are confined
to the loess-covered areas. They 
appear as conical hollows in the 
grassland. [SYMBOL] 9. 

Ascent from La Plagne.   Beech is 
dominant up to c.1500m. in this 
W. facing cirque. Fine holloway 
through the meadows, lined with 
coppice hazel and beech. [SYMBOL]8. 

Pinus mugo. Dominant tree through-
out the Granier. Occurs throughout 
the plateau. Mainly in the upright 
Spirken form; the Latschen form is
less abundant, but occurs mixed 
with the upright form, particularly 
where some non-loess soil has
accumulated. The two forms seem
distinct in the main, but intermed-
iates occur. 
   Forest nearly always open. 
Understorey scattered, of juniper and 
occasional Latschen. About 3% of 
the trees on the plateau are spruces 
mainly at lower altitudes.
Ground vegetation generally tall 
grasses, sedges, Rhododendron; 
more abundant at lower altitudes. 
   Pinus mugo appears to be 
dominant also in the Rochers de

[17354-17355]
l'Alpe, though the trees at the 
edge of the pasture are spruce. 
   Pinus mugo descends to the 
edge of the plateau at the Pas 
de la Porte, but suddenly disap-
pears at the foor of the eastern 
cliffs. 
   Habit of the tree-form is some-
times columnar and pointed-topped
like Cupressus sempervirens; less 
often rounded-topped like Pinus 
Cembra. Trees near the summit, 
on the edge of the great cliff, are 
flat-topped ([SYMBOL]30). 
   Surprisingly few dead or fallen
trees (5% or less of total). Maxi-
mum diameter c. 2ft. Few young
trees - unless, as is possible, some 
of the Latschen graduate into the 
tree-form. 

Forest below north face.  Looked down 
upon from height of about 1000m. Dom-
inated by beech; conifers not con-
spicuous. The Col de Granier road 
and the Lac Noir are the chief fea-
tures. Most of the forest has the 
coarse texture of big trees, but there
are irregular patches of finer tex-
ture indicating coppicing or other 
regeneration. These are nor particu-
larly related to reads. They do not 
have sharp edges and may be 
natural variations in structure. In 
places there is the illusion of tree-
-rows; these occur chiefly among the 
big trees, where they are least likely 
to be real, and pay no attention to
the topography [SYMBOL] 23,24,27,28,31. 

[17356-17357]
Abymes de Myans. Classic disper-
sed landscaope. Details difficult 
to see because of haze, which 
totally obscured everything more dis-
tant. 

Has the plateau been exploited? 
   The place marked Fontaine Neuve 
has a little trickle of water (due
to an n50 outcrop) with scanty 
remains of a hut and slight eu-
trophication of the vegetation. 
   The enrichment of the summit 
vegetation suggests sheep. 
   The Pas de la Porte is a rocky 
couloir which is an easy climb for 
a man but would hardly be prac-
ticable for sheep in its present 
state. It would probably be easy 
to make it passable. 
   The present age-structure of the 
trees (lack of very old, dead, and 
young trees) suggests past exploit-
ation. No stumps seen. 

   Birch is frequent on the plateau. 
   Army helicopters practising
landings are an unexpected hazard 
on the summit knoll. 

   On leaving the plateau there is 
a sudden descent into spruce 
forest, then to Abies and beech. 
Several minor cliff-lines in upper 
part. Descent steep and way dif-
ficult to find. 
   Source des Épasses is a powerful 
spring tapped for water.

kc.) does not begin till below

   Massive staining in this 
year's wood of epicormic twigs 
still bearing leaves on trees that 
   
[17360-17361]
are otherwise dead (but not
in dead epicormics). 
   These trees form a group, 
mixed with other species, in 
the municipal camp-site
at the Grand-Port, in the 
angle between the Sierroz 
river (on the S. side of the river) 
and the boulevards along the 
lake.
   Several of  [DIAG]
the affected
trees have 
had earth 
piled around
their bases in a road-
widening operation. Most
of the elms so treated are long 
dead, and a few of the 
alders mixed with them are 
dead also. Some of the dead 
elmshave vigorous Armillaria 
rhizomorphs. The earth around
trees away from the road
widening is much compacted
andsome alders and other 
species show signs of distress. 
   This elm is probably of 
planted origin but has multi-
plied by suckering. Some 
deaths may bedue to dis-
turbance and Armillaria, but
DED is certainly present
and must be mainly respon-
sible at least for the trees 
killed this year. 
   Elms otherwise are exceed-
ingly rare in Aix. Three hours 
in the town yielded the fol-
lowing other trees:

[17362-17363]

   Tilestone roofs, as on all local 
Stadeln and other buildings. 

Eggen is a street of huts, 
evidently intended for simmer 
occupation with animals. Doubt-
ful if any have been used this 
years though most are reasonably 
complete. Most are wholly of 
Blockbau, though some have a 
timber lower floor. Mostlyt 2-storey, 
some 3. Several "semi-detached"
pairs under one roof. 
   Lower storey is the stall for 
animals. Door faces street. Two 
massive posts with rather stereotyped 
chamfers. Inner openwork door 
(see sketch), outer solid door. 
   Upper storeys are for living and 
probably storing hay. Floors have 
just one or two massive joists,
into the sides of which the heavy

[17376-17377]
planks fit by grooves. The 1st 
floor always has a balcony on 
street front, carried on the projec-
ting ends of these joists, with stairs 
at one side. Usually no parapet. 
   Two different ways of prevent-
ing gable collapsing. It may 
be lapped over short timber 
cross-pieces which form buttresses; 
or it may be held between two 
vertical needles passing through 
a beam some 3ft below the ridge-
-tree and lodged at their upper 
ends in the ridge itself, thus:

   Very different from Eggen. In-
doubtedly an all-year settlement, 
though it is doubtful if more than
one or two houses are now continuously 
inhabited; it was largely shut up
today. About 20 houses plus a few
huts of the Eggen type. Small but 
well-appointed and well-maintained
stone-vaulted chapel. 
   Houses are the usual Block-
baw type, usually three storeys, the lower 
of stone. Smaller than those in the 
main valley; often only one room 
per floor. Roofs of great tilestones. 
Numerous jetties. Steep rather 
terraced site. 
   Functional water-mill. 
   Numerous Stadeln in meadows
around. Mostly well-maintained. 
Often on staddles on stone base. ([SYMBOL] 23). 

   Grazing by goats, which are rather 
too friendly. 

Findelgletscher. 
   Remarkablefor its giant mor-
aines, up to 300 ft high on each 
side, with a valley containing 
a stream at the back. 
   The inner face of each moraine 
is a cliff, where the moraine was 
eaten away at the last readvance. 
Cliffs are relatively stable but 
eroded into gullies which recur 
at very regular intervals. Material
is quite unsorted. Boulders, as big
as a church or smaller, stick out 
from the cliffs like currants in a 
bun. [SYMBOL] 5/5. 
   The northern moraine has 
three or perhaps four parallel

[17384-17385]
ridges (see contours on 1:50,000
map), from successive advances. 
Not quite so evident on the S. 
   The moraine and Vorfeld
show different degrees of recolon-
ization. They presumed to have 
been exposed in 1856 now has
sizeable larch trees but as 
yet hardly any Pinus cembra 
(see earlier) although the latter
grows on the unglaciated slopes
above. 
   Salix serpyllifolia is abundant 
on the younger moraine. Has splen-
