Elm Disease. 
   One small Up dead in 
front of Moor Burns cottage, 
Madingley. 
   2 Up mod. - severeat SW 
corner of White-Pits Plantation; 
c. 6 dead among houses to S. 
   One Uc ? v. slight between
Scotland Farm and road
   One out of 40 Bixworth 
elms severe (but diagnosis
uncertain) along Childerley lane. 
   About 4 Uc long-dead by 
last farm before Knapwell turn
(but none affected this year). 
  About 5% of the elm along 
this road is Up. 

Knapwell Wood: one big Uc 

[17332-17333]

affected. Three big Uc in N.

dead. 
   Knapwell: about 6 elms 
[!!!!]affected[!!!!] dead, scattered in s[????]th
of modern village. This includes
a group of three big pollards 
on E. of road opposite S. end
of Overhall Grove. 
   Small amount of disease 
in Knapwell Wood and Over-

   Bourn Airfield area: 
about 10% dead, mainly Up
and mainly dead at least a

drought, with marginal shrivelling
of leaves and early leaf-fall. 
   The great elm on the 
triangular green at Bourn 
is apparently gxc. Just 
under half the crown is

poles, variable in size, about 
12 ft apart each way. 
   Near Wimille in a very 
windswept place there are 
several elm groves surrounded 
by polygonal walls some 10ft 
high. They are apparently 
derived from old gardens.

Sept. 10. 
   Along the bank to Montag-
nole. There are ash trees
which have been pollarded 
in the alpine manner about 
10 years ago. 
   Aspen is frequent and 
Frangula occasional in

   Numerous ash pollards, 
some newly cut, in the 
Entremonts. 
   The Val de Entremonts con-
tains few hedges, mostly very 
rich. They separate meadows and
mostly coincide with

  As then ascended from Entremont
Le Vieux via La Plagne and the 
ladder from the Alpette. Descent 
this time was not by the Porte

various heights, leaving a crown or

some free-standing. 

Hedges (see also p. 7341-2)
   Occur in most of the Entremont

Lobaria. On pollard sycamore, 
very luxuriant but dying back. 
La Grénery; also seen around Col

Geology. Most of    [DIAG]
the thickness is 
Lower Urgonian, 
n4U, massive 
white limestone,
which forms the 
great cliffs. The 
lower limestone
is not stratified but strongly 
fissured vertically [SYMBOL]10; the iron ladder 
passes through one of these fissures. 
The upper portion is increasingly 
stratified giving rise to small ledges. 
The n50 is not very easily seen, 
because covered with talus; it 
gives rise to small cliff-lines on the 
plateau, and to breaks in the great 
cliffs [SYMBOL]21.   (Upper Urgonian)
    n5U [SYMBOL] forms parts of the 
Granier plateau; it is stratified
like the upper n4U. It also forms
the rocky part of the Alpe[!!!!] plateau, 
and overhangs the n50 giving the 
Roches de Belles-Ombres. 
   All the limestone where exposed 
is deeply fissured with grykes. 
   About a third of the Granier 
plateau is covered with what 
appears to be loess: fine yellow
soil. The loess is always grassy 
without trees, while the limestone 
is covered, sometimes thinly, with 
trees and bushes (more extensive 
than the map shows). A similar 
distinction exists on the Alpe, 

[17352-17353]
where the fine grassland appears 
to be on loess (mapped as 
C6-7M, "craie marneuse" of Upper 
Cretaceous, and n6L, Upper Aptian), 
while the open forest is on bare 
limestone. 
   Dolines are fairly frequent on 
the Granier plateau and the Alpe, 
and in both cases are confined
to the loess-covered areas. They 
appear as conical hollows in the 
grassland. [SYMBOL] 9. 

Ascent from La Plagne.   Beech is 
dominant up to c.1500m. in this 
W. facing cirque. Fine holloway 
through the meadows, lined with 
coppice hazel and beech. [SYMBOL]8. 

Pinus mugo. Dominant tree through-
out the Granier. Occurs throughout 
the plateau. Mainly in the upright 
Spirken form; the Latschen form is
less abundant, but occurs mixed 
with the upright form, particularly 
where some non-loess soil has
accumulated. The two forms seem
distinct in the main, but intermed-
iates occur. 
   Forest nearly always open. 
Understorey scattered, of juniper and 
occasional Latschen. About 3% of 
the trees on the plateau are spruces 
mainly at lower altitudes.
Ground vegetation generally tall 
grasses, sedges, Rhododendron; 
more abundant at lower altitudes. 
   Pinus mugo appears to be 
dominant also in the Rochers de

[17354-17355]
l'Alpe, though the trees at the 
edge of the pasture are spruce. 
   Pinus mugo descends to the 
edge of the plateau at the Pas 
de la Porte, but suddenly disap-
pears at the foor of the eastern 
cliffs.
