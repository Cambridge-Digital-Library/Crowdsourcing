October 21.
Armillaria is abundant
in an area a few ft. deep
extending for some 50 yards
along the w. railings of
Newnham College. Large
masses of toadstools are
on two big old stumps
near the N. end. From
here it seems to have
spread, mainly to the S., 
jumping a gateway.
The site of the poplar
which died earlier in the
year is near the S. end,
and toadstools are
abundant on the site.
THey also occur at
the base of dead hedge
shrubs (the hedge being
beech and privet, the
beech has largely survived
whhile there are serious
[5660-5661]
losses, some recent, in the
privet). There is a big
clump of toadstools at the
foot of an apparently
healthy lime tree, the
only big tree remaining
in the area. Smaller trees
and shrubs are apparently
unaffected so far.
