1970  2745  [SYMBOL]
January 1.
Leaves of aconites and
snowdrops are just visible above
the soil.
January 9.
The Ouse Washes at Manea
are not quite full of water. Large
flocks of duck.
No water in the Welland
Washes, which appear to be
permanent grass.
Much of the Holland Marsh-
land, in the Great Postland, Pinch-
beck, and Quadring areas, is
a "normal" landscape with hedged
fields (mainly hawthorn) and
much permanent grass.
The high land begins im-
perceptibly in the very treeless

[12746-12747]
2746

area around Helpringham, Kesteven.
Lincoln Wolds are a
largely hedgeless and treeless
plateau. Certain valleys, e.g.
that of Metheringham, are steep
and have tongues of peat at
the bottom. No woods visible.
At Lincoln, a tongue of
peat runs along the Witham
valley through the city. The
river is navigable with locks.
January 10.   Clarence House
              Todhills
The valley    Spennymoor
floor of the Wear is occupied
mainly by long-disused pits
and tips, much overgrown by
willows and other trees.
January 11.
The [!!!!]plantations[!!!!] woods around

2747

and on the ramparts of Vinovia,
or Binchester (Bishop Auckland)
are mainly oak and sycamore,
probably planted within the last
150 years. Possible older trees
in the Bell Burn valley. Ram-
parts themselves are low
banks.
Between Vinovia and Auck-
land Park, on a terrace of the
Wear, are two free-standing
oaks of immense size. Short
stout trunks and vast
hemispherical crowns (dia. c.
150 ft); apparently not pollarded:
Hedges in this area
almost entirely hawthorn, with
a few oak standards.


[12748-12749]
2748

Escomb.
Old village on the hill;
around the church at the bot-
tom is mainly early 19th cent.
mining houses, recently thinned
out and tidied up after a
period of dereliction.
Church in a circular
churhcyard; wall probably not
ancient.
Stones of the church are
gigantic: see measurements op-
posite. Some of the window
and door heads and jambs are
at least as large.
Note that the upper courses
of both nave and chancel are of
much smaller stones, the trans-
ition being sharp but irregular.

2749
[DIAG]
Nave roof massive, of crooked
and wavey but not knotty
timbers. Probably not a Victorian
replacement.
January 12.

[12750-12751]
2750

The woods in North Gosforth
are mainly plantations with
much sycamore.
January 13.
Floods in the Aycliffe area.
The woods at Syston near
Grantham are mainly oak
and birch, apparanetly not 3-
-layered. Much of them re-
mains.
January 14. [DIAG]
Crocus tomassinianus
leaves just showing.
January 17.
Many of the great elms in
Newmarket Road, Norwich survive,
though sadly lopped.
Broom Cover by the road
at Carleton Forehoe has a wood

2751

bank and coppice, but is ap-
parently not 3-layered.
Scoulton Mere woods are
largely birch and replanted 
conifers. The island in the mere
is covered in secondary birch wood.
January 18.
Chippenham Fen.
Felling encroaching birch,
ash, and Frangula. Part
of the S.E. reed field near the
entrance to the Fen.
The offending trees, up to
12 in. dia., were felled and the
stumps painted with 2:4:5-T.
Most of the trees in this
area appear to belong to 3
generations, the A generation
ash, the B generation ash &

[12752-12753]
2752

birch (mostly B. pendula) and
the C generation, up to c.15
years old, ash with some
Frangula. The following two
ash trees appeared to belong
to the B generation. At the
time of felling the water level
was about at the surface of
the peat, the ground being inter-
sected with deep concealed chan-
nels.
A. [DIAG]

2753
B. [DIAG]
These trees are thus some-
what anomalous, especially the
wide rings in the 1930s.
[!!!!] Tree and bush cover
not more that 10% in all.
Birch stumps not countable.
Frangula is fairly abun-
dant. Rhizomatous: suckers
and roots all tinged bright

[12754-12755]
2754

yellow.


January 31.
Castor Hanglands (Historical
Ecology Group).

1. Outliers
The small wood around
123012 and the larger one at
127014 appear to be intact,
mainly "deciduous high forest".
Blacklands, 123023, is a
tract of dense scrub by the
road.
The parish boundary hedge
along the N. side of the wood
is mainly hawthorn (and

2755
oak standards), post-
-enclosure.
Heath pits at the N.E. end
of the reserve is a large dis-
used system of pits with long-
-established grassland and
patches of hawthorn scrub.

2. Hanglands Wood
The E. [SYMBOL] was not entered.
It has been underplanted
with conifers and poisoned by
the Forestry Commission. The
wood-bank on the E. side is
not visible from the road.
The part within the reserve
is a typical 3-layered wood,
except for secondary woodland
outside the wood-bank. Structure
variable; one layer often missing.

[12756-12757]
2756
Geological variation is com-
plex and runs E.-W. North of
the "pond leg" is mainly limestone,
S. of it mainly clay. This appears
as differences of drainage. The
woodland structure and vegetation
are not evidently directly affected
by geological variation. The soil in
each case may be derived from
thin drift.
A. 3-layered coppice wood.
About 2 acres recently cop-
piced; standards augmented
by promoting one ash per stool.
Boundary bank moderately
strong, slight encroachment of
wood beyond it.
B. Similar overgrown cop-
pice getting progressively wetter.
Scrub obscures much of the

2757
bank.
In A, ash stools c. 4ftx6in.
An oak was half cut through
many years ago and still lives.
C. This area is known to
be secondary, on the site of
several old closes between the
wood and the heath. Consists
of pole oak and ash, with
little small coppice and no
large. Boundary bank very
slight and symmetrical, with
some encroachment onto the
heath beyond it.
D. A very wet area with
huge widely spaced ash stools.
Little small coppice, no stan-
dards. Patches of Carex pendula
especially by the old wood
bank; elsewhere the ground is

[12758-12759]
2758
now largely bare.
Ash stool c. 7ft & 6ft, 2ft
9in. high. [SYMBOL] 4 (with George
Peterken).
Lady Wood. This area
appears not to have closes
of secondary woodland in front
of it. The whole has big stools,
becoming scattered in the south.
Much scrub around the edge
on the wood bank.
Bank between C and D:
normal wood-bank, but vari-
able in strength, and apparently
petering out in the S.
E. Scattered big ash stools.
F. In this area there is a
T-junction of big wood banks.
The S. end of Hanglands
Wood appears to be a separate

2759
ditch-bound enclosure. To the
N. of this there is probably
another area of secondary
wood (F').

1. Hanglands has many
characteristics of ancient wood-
land: structure, huge stools in
the wetter areas, sinuous wood-bank,
&c.
2. The contrast with the at-
tached secondary woodland is
striking and reflects the boun-
daries at the 1st ed. O.S.
3. The variety of trees &
shrubs is apparently not out-
standing.
4. There is some historical com-
plexity at least at the S. end
5. The structural uniformity

[12760-12761]
2760
over the geological diversity
is remarkable.
6. No sign of acid areas.
7. Wide range of wetness.
8. Has the structure of the W.
Cambs woods and the plant
composition of South Hunts.
9. Not very long uncoppiced;
has escaped the worst of
post-1914 devastation.
10. No evidence of planted ex-
otics.
11. Slight "black hole" depressions
in area D.

3. Ailsworth Heath.
Northern spinney: secondary
woodland with a broad scrub
margin; apparently no boundary
ditch.

2761
Northern Heath: now largely
cleared of scrub. Coarse tall
Dactylis-Arrhenatherum grass-
land, occasional bushes. There
has been some grazing in
recent years. Pronounced ridge
& furrow running N. & S.
Middle Spinney: as Nor-
thern Spinney; has increased
since 1961.
Middle Heath: much
wetter than Northern Heath,
swampy at its S. end. Traces
of R. & F. running E. & W.
Pond Leg: Wet and swampy
Some recent pond digging.
The Moffit: very wet,
swampy away from the length-
wise track. Several transverse
ditches. Tall grasses with

[12762-12763]
2762
patches of scrub.

4. Moore Wood.
A surviving fragment was
visited at G.
Largely 1-storeyed oak,
probably even-aged. No regu-
[????]l[????]ar coppice. Sparse hazel and
very sparse maiden ash.
Ground vegetation mainly bram-
bles.
Wood bank probably recently
altered.
Much drier than most of
Hanglands and probably more
acid.
Although the documentary evi-
dence for this wood is similar to
that for Hanglands, the evidence
that it is primary is much weaker.
