snowdrops are just visible above

The Ouse Washes at Manea

flocks of duck.
No water in the Welland
Washes, which appear to be
permanent grass.
Much of the Holland Marsh-
land, in the Great Postland, Pinch-
beck, and Quadring areas, is
a "normal" landscape with hedged
fields (mainly hawthorn) and
much permanent grass.
The high land begins im-
perceptibly in the very treeless

area around Helpringham, Kesteven.
Lincoln Wolds are a
largely hedgeless and treeless
plateau. Certain valleys, e.g.
that of Metheringham, are steep
and have tongues of peat at
the bottom. No woods visible.
At Lincoln, a tongue of
peat runs along the Witham
valley through the city. The
river is navigable with locks.

in the Bell Burn valley. Ram-
parts themselves are low
banks.
