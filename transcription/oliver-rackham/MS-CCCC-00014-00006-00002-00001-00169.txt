1970  2745  [SYMBOL]
January 1.
Leaves of aconites and
snowdrops are just visible above
the soil.
January 9.
The Ouse Washes at Manea
are not quite full of water. Large
flocks of duck.
No water in the Welland
Washes, which appear to be
permanent grass.
Much of the Holland Marsh-
land, in the Great Postland, Pinch-
beck, and Quadring areas, is
a "normal" landscape with hedged
fields (mainly hawthorn) and
much permanent grass.
The high land begins im-
perceptibly in the very treeless

[12746-12747]
2746

area around Helpringham, Kesteven.
Lincoln Wolds are a
largely hedgeless and treeless
plateau. Certain valleys, e.g.
that of Metheringham, are steep
and have tongues of peat at
the bottom. No woods visible.
At Lincoln, a tongue of
peat runs along the Witham
valley through the city. The
river is navigable with locks.
January 10.   Clarence House
              Todhills
The valley    Spennymoor
floor of the Wear is occupied
mainly by long-disused pits
and tips, much overgrown by
willows and other trees.
January 11.
The [!!!!]plantations[!!!!] woods around

2747

and on the ramparts of Vinovia,
or Binchester (Bishop Auckland)
are mainly oak and sycamore,
probably planted within the last
150 years. Possible older trees
in the Bell Burn valley. Ram-
parts themselves are low
banks.
Between Vinovia and Auck-
land Park, on a terrace of the
Wear, are two free-standing
oaks of immense size. Short
stout trunks and vast
hemispherical crowns (dia. c.
150 ft); apparently not pollarded:
Hedges in this area
almost entirely hawthorn, with
a few oak standards.


[12748-12749]
2748

Escomb.
Old village on the hill;
around the church at the bot-
tom is mainly early 19th cent.
mining houses, recently thinned
out and tidied up after a
period of dereliction.
Church in a circular
churhcyard; wall probably not
ancient.
Stones of the church are
gigantic: see measurements op-
posite. Some of the window
and door heads and jambs are
at least as large.
Note that the upper courses
of both nave and chancel are of
much smaller stones, the trans-
ition being sharp but irregular.

2749
[DIAG]
Nave roof massive, of crooked
and wavey but not knotty
timbers. Probably not a Victorian
replacement.
January 12.

[12750-12751]
2750

The woods in North Gosforth
are mainly plantations with
much sycamore.
January 13.
Floods in the Aycliffe area.
The woods at Syston near
Grantham are mainly oak
and birch, apparanetly not 3-
-layered. Much of them re-
mains.
January 14. [DIAG]
Crocus tomassinianus
leaves just showing.
January 17.
Many of the great elms in
Newmarket Road, Norwich survive,
though sadly lopped.
Broom Cover by the road
at Carleton Forehoe has a wood

2751

bank and coppice, but is ap-
parently not 3-layered.
Scoulton Mere woods are
largely birch and replanted 
conifers. The island in the mere
is covered in secondary birch wood.
January 18.
Chippenham Fen.
Felling encroaching birch,
ash, and Frangula. Part
of the S.E. reed field near the
entrance to the Fen.
The offending trees, up to
12 in. dia., were felled and the
stumps painted with 2:4:5-T.
Most of the trees in this
area appear to belong to 3
generations, the A generation
ash, the B generation ash &

[12752-12753]
2752

birch (mostly B. pendula) and
the C generation, up to c.15
years old, ash with some
Frangula. The following two
ash trees appeared to belong
to the B generation. At the
time of felling the water level
was about at the surface of
the peat, the ground being inter-
sected with deep concealed chan-
nels.
