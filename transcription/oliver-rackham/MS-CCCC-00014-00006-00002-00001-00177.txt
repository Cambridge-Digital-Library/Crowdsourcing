Bradfield Woods  Reconnaisance
with Dr Litchfield, Mr Cullum,
and Colin Ranson.

  Agrimonia odorata is the
commoner sp. and occurs in
rides and at the wood
margin in many places in
FHW, and in Cargate Ride (MPW).
  Geranium robertianum is
sparse at the roadside, FHW.
  The 1970 coppice has grown
about 1 - 1 1/2 ft:  ash slightly
more than oak, birch, alder,
hazel which are about
equal.
  Mr Cullum says that
Front Fell produced spec-

[13374-13375]
3374
tacular primroses when last
cut.
  Melampyrum is flourishing
and still flowering by Front
Fell.  [SYMBOL] 9.
  Lithospermum could not 
be found in Shady Ride, but
3 plants (much stunted by
drought) grow on the Fish
Pond bridge.
  Mr Cullum does not have
a use for the elm in Fox-
hunters, nor for maple. 
  Much of the older ash 
in Foxhunters is of excellent
quality.  Mr Cullum says it
is sometimes black-hearted.
No deer damage so far
in the 1969 coppice.
3375
  Mr Cullum says late
frost damage caused perman-
ent distortion of the coppice,
especially ash, in the 1965
part of Foxhunters.  There 
appears to be a slight hollow
caused by the down-slope
meeting the wood-bank.
  He says that the felling of
1929 made a mess of the 
coppice.  In the 1930s they set
the coppice to rights and tidied
up the numerous tops of
felled oaks that were lying
about.  They also pulled out
some of the oak stumps.
  He does not have a use
for lime, but remembers it
for its very soft wood (be-

[13376-13377]
3376
coming rather hard when
seasoned) and stringy bark.
He says there was some at
the last coppicing in Front
Fell.
  He says hornbeam oc-
curred only in Barn Fell,
MPW.  His predecessors tried to
kill it by repeated cutting.
  The coppicers do not like
the smell of wild garlic.
  A form of Hypericum
perforatum without the gland
dots was seen by the Crane
Track in the [!!!!196] 1970 coppice.
  A very large form of Veronica
chamaedrys was seen in the

  Potentilla erecta and Ranun-
culus flammula occur in Fel-
sham Hall main ride near the
reed-bed.
  Mr Cullum calls the W.
cross-roads in FHW Frosty Corner
and says frost csn be seen
there on more days than any-
where else.
  He says the willows along 
the rides were planted from
cuttings raised in a willow nur-
sery in the outer bracken
glade of Middle DFell.  Some were
felled some years ago and
fetched good money for bats.
  The rack along the N.E.
side of Fishpond Fell was main-
tained as it used to be be-
3379
cause it was Miss George's
father's favourite walk. The
main bridge is a recent
addition;  there was no previous

  It was decided that the
