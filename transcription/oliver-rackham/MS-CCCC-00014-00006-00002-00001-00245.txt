   The grassland around the
B and C exclosures has become
thick and tussocky over many
years. The characteristic herbs
are not easily seen but most
of them can be found by dili-
gent search.
   Many pines have been cut
down in the last few years in
the area of grassland A.

   Moderate frost damage to
bracken, which has crippled fronds
in many areas but has not set
off any replacement.

  Beeches at Cadsden are still
severely chlorotic, hardly altered
from last year. Occasional trees
dead. Symptoms abundant in
shallow-rendzina woods; those on
plateau soils apparently un-
affected. Probably no symptoms
in Lodge Wood (Prestwood).
  One plant of Atropa seen in
valley at Cadsden.
Valley bottoms at Cadsden
are still largely grassland;
little evidence of encroaching
trees. Arrhenatheretum.

  Surface is rather uneven.
Beech litter is drifted by wind
& collects in hollows and espe-
cially on both sides of the plan-
tation-fence. Litter up to 9"
deep in hollows, over mull.
  Replanted area (c. 10 y ago)
was felled and planted with Cir-
sicem. Establishment very
patchy, much of the pine only
3 ft high. Area becoming 
dominated by ash. Sallow
ab. despite shallow rendzina
soil (aspect approx. N).
Such ashes as occur in
the rendzina beechwoods are
8967
mostly in good condition,
though some of the bigger ones
suffer from foliage-bleaching.

Patch of loess.
  At the top of the spur
on which the shallow-rendzina
woods are demonstrated is
a solitary oak (Q. robur).
Small patch (c. 10 yds across),

  The richest flora is at the 
plateau edge, where occa-
sional chalk fragments are
visible in the soil, esp. in the
vicinity of woodbanks & hollo-
ways.  Trees include hazel as
well as ash. Hordelymus ab.
Mercury and Rubus corylif.
Fragaria.
  At one place, on the edge
of the S.E. replanted areas,
the fall of a beech reveals
some 2 ft of apparently ty-
pical cwF over chalk. But
nearby grow foxgloves.

Pulpit Hill.
  Beeches in the same very
chlorotic state as before. No
further deaths. One dead tree

Chalk grass-
land is slightly
more bushed over than
last year (when clearing
work had been done). Grass
rather long (c. 4-5") and
weakly tussocky, but most
herbs survive. No Herminium
seen.
  Ex-arable little altered.
Anacamptis ab. (not seen on
chalk grassland). Turf still
largely composed of herbs other
than grasses.
[18970-18971]

Juniper bushes in scrub are 
old and have apparently
recovered from a phase of
decline. One juniper seen in

Phytophthora. Old symptoms
seen on many beeches. None
new.

Beech seedlings. One of this year.
None of last year's seem to have
survived.

Young generaton of beeches
still making very slow growth.
No distinct B horizon visible
in podsol.
  Gleying is rather indistinct.
[18972-18973]
8971
  The only beech seedlings
are in the soil pit, where there
are several of 2-3 years' growth
in places where dead leaves col-
lect. None of this year's or last
year's germination.

   Berkhamsted Common
  The slopes above Northchurch
are mainly hawthorn succession
with much bracken. Frequency
of pioneer oak increases north-
wards. Birch not abundant
till the plateau is reached.
  Some old beeches, perhaps
derived from hedges, on earth-
works on the northern part
of the Common.

  The object of the expedition

by Lancelot Speed from Strathbran
Lodge in 1885 and apparently 
not visited since. His directions
were accurate and precise and we
found rhe place first time.

The Cavern on Sgurr a'Mhuilinn
[or, properly, sg. a' Oblas Leathaid]
From Lancelot Speed. A sojourn in the
Highlands. [No publisher, date of the 
events is 1885]
Saturday, November 21st. A thaw had
set in so I thought skating in water was
not good enough. I crossed the river
with the Berthon boat [i.e. the R. Bran
from Strathran Lodge] and went up
Scour Vinillin to find the caves after having
looked well at the place through the
glass.
Directions for finding the cave in Scour
Vinillin --
From the dining room window [of
Strathbarn Lodge] find the rock A with the
glass and go to it. A is at the foot of a
green sloe and a large rock is at B.
[18984-18985]
8984
  The top edge of the rock A is lying
N.W. and S.E.
  Go and sit on it facing west by
south.
  At 10 yards before you is the rock
B, easily recognised. Follow to the right
to the big square stone C and go and
sit on the other side of it, i.e. facing
west by south, and with your back to the
stone. A flat stone, partly grass-grown
affords a natural seat.
  Right before you is the immense
cairn of loose stones, and close to you is
the group here shown.
  Tbere are three dark holes; the middle 
one is the cave. The opening is just large
enough to admit a man, and the entrance
looks very damp and dripping. Inside,
however, all is quite dry and the floor
is covered with dry brown bones.
8985
  Surrounded by dry bones, I lunched 
in the cave by the candle's flckering
gleam.
  The two horizontal lines in the 
sketch represent Loch Luichart as seen
from the cave. After leaving the cave I
went round Scour Ronach and up the
east face, where I had a steep climb
over the slippery ground, after being
obliged to go on hands and knees.

  Speed's description is remarkably
like what is there now. Block A is
the most conspicuous rock from Ach-
analt on the front of a small ter-
race-like projection of the mount-
ain. It is at the foot of the "cairn",
actually a jumbled mass of coarse
scree, blocks up to c. 15 ft across.
These are heavily lichenized and evi-
dently very stable, though we found
one block that had fallen from
the cliff behind and shattered
within the last year or so.
  Fig. 1 is an accurate representa-
tion of the cliffs of the N. side of
Glas Leathaid.
  In Fig. 2 all the blocks can
still be recognized without difficulty.

actual cave. The shape of the

mouth and the small boulders hold-
ing up the roof-slab on the left are
unmistakeable.
  The only change is that most 
of the grass mentioned in the text 
and on the figures is now dom-
inated by Vaccinium and evidently
somewhat taller than in 1885.
The cave is about 15 ft dia.,
6 ft max. height. Formed by one
huge boulder propped up against
others. Rather damp; has holes in
roof between the boulders. The floor
is now mainly earth, but gentle
probing produced several sheep
bones and a few of rodents.

  Most of Strathbran Planta-

ago. There has been no natural
replacement. Trees were mainly
spruce. Much of the site has
been replanted, but a broad
gap has been left below Loch

  Loch Dailfhearne is a notable

  The chambered cairn is a 
low grassy hillside, perhaps natu-
ral, with a number of boulders
projecting c. 6 ft from it - set
on their short axes.  There is 
no sign that it ever had a de-
finite barrow, or what happened
to the material if there was one.
Charles MacBurney says the 
Neolithic chambered tombs of this
area typically occur in round
rather than long barrows.
  In a commanding position at

  A boat is kept on Loch Fannich,

loch with the Marquesa's ghillie
in his land-Rover. There is a 
very rough, just passable track up
from Dos Mhucharain. It crosses
the outlet of Loch na Moine by
a high and perilous wooden
bridge. Arrived at the Loch, the
ghillie retrieved the boat and took 
us to Neot. The weather was
stormy and the loch high; I was
mildly seasick. We got soaked
within a few minutes. The ghillie
cannot swim. I was to go into 
the mountains while the MacBurneys
fished.
  Neot is a Victorian house, in

  Return by same route.
Found the MacBurneys still fishing
and rowed them about for a 
while on the loch; they were quite
successful.
  Weather quite exceptionally
rough. A strong W. wind raised
9029
considerable waves on the loch
and low cloud hung over the moun-
tains. Continual rsin throughout the
ascent. On the summit a Force 7-8
wind drove sleet and snow horizon-
tally, making it difficult to see
(glasses) and almost impossible to
take notes. Descent quite difficult
- the compass was difficut to con-
sult, so hard was the rain. not par-
ticularly cold. Visibility c. 200 yards
on summit (which was well above
the cloud-base). Weather slightly
improved on the descent.
  On the way back we passed
a land-Rover which had left the
track and was lying, half on its
side, perched precariously over a 
bog. We were relieved to find no-
one in it. It was apparently a
[19030-19031]
9030
neighbour's but what it was doing
there was a mystery. The track
at that point was straight and
even and there was no need for 
it to run off.
  Returned to the Marquesa's and 
were regaled by her with whiskey
before a great fire.

Water-supply of the house at Achanalt
  A tank has been made from
a length of drainpipe sunk in the
blanket-bog and bottomed with
cement. It is at a higher level
than the header-tank in the house
which it supplies by a plastic pipe.
It is filled by a plastic hose, some
20 yds long from a grip cut to
receive percolation from the bog.
The weather apart from the last
9031
few days has been unusually dry.
The supply failed for much of the
time. We were reduced to filling
vessels at a stream some 100 yds
away N.E. of the house.
  The inlet to the tank is a 
very sensitive measure of runoff from
the bog. It diminishes or dries 
up when the sun comes out or 
even in the afternoon if an over-
cast day, but slight rain starts it
again. Owing to airlocks it is
difficult to get water flowing to
the house when once the supply 
has been interrupted.

  The planted beeches in Oak-
firth are suffering from basal gnaw-
ing. Many suffer bark aphid se-
verely. One was noted with many
black stromata of Nectria break-
ing out through the bsrk; this was
a larger tree than most of its con-
temporaries and was quite dead.

Small animals trapping (Patrick
Dillon).
  This was done in the S. hedge
of the E.-W. holloway N. of Urch-
font Manor, and in Beech
Hanging and the edges of Oak-
firth. Use of Longworth traps
and others improvised from coffee
jars. Longworth trap is said to
cost £50.
  Apple used for bait - it pro

  Several traps were sprung with-
out catching anything. A few
bank-voles were caught. One,
pronounced to be "a young male
in good breeding condition", gave
birth to six within the hour.
 
 Hedges around Urchfont are
mostly of 4-6 species, even if
straight. Lichens on trees are
