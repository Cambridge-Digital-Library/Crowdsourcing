   The grassland around the
B and C exclosures has become
thick and tussocky over many
years. The characteristic herbs
are not easily seen but most
of them can be found by dili-
gent search.
   Many pines have been cut
down in the last few years in
the area of grassland A.

   Moderate frost damage to
bracken, which has crippled fronds
in many areas but has not set
off any replacement.

  Beeches at Cadsden are still
severely chlorotic, hardly altered
from last year. Occsional trees
dead. Symptoms abundant in
shallow-rendzina woods; those on
plateau soils apparently un-
affected. Probably no symptoms
in Lodge Wood (Prestwood).
  One plant of Atropa seen in

  The richest flora is at the

vicinity of woodbanks & hollo-
ways.  Trees include hazel as
well as ash. Hordelymus ab.
Mercury and Rubus corylif.
Fragaria.
  At one place, on the edge
of the S.E. replanted areas,
the fall of a beech reveals
some 2 ft of apprarently ty-
pical cwF over chalk. But
nearby grow foxgloves.

Chalk grass-
land is slightly

in places where dead leaves col-
lect. None of this year's or last

   Berkhamsted Common
  The slopes above Northchurch
are mainly hawthorn succession

derived from hedges, on earth-
works on the northern part
of the Common.

From Lancelot Speed. A sojourn in the
Highlands. [No publisher, date of the 
events is l1885]
Saturday, November 21st. A thaw had
set in so I thought skating in water was
not good enough. I crossed the river
with the Berthon boat [i.e. the R. Bran
from Strathran Lodge] and went up
Scour Vinillin to find the caves after having
looked well at the place through the
glass.
Directions for finding the cave in Scour
Vinillin --
From the dining room window [of
Strathbarn Lodge] find the rock A with the
glass and go to it. A is at the foot of a
green sloe and a large rock is at B.
[18984-18985]
8984
  The top edge of the rock A is lying
N.W. and S.E.
  Go and sit on it facing west by
south.
  At 10 yards befoee you is the rock
B, easily recognised. Follow to the right
to the big square stone C and go and
sit on the other side of it, i.e. facing
west by south, and with yout back to the
stone. A flat stone, partly grass-grown
affords a natural seat.
  Right before you is the immens
cairn of loose stones, and close to you is
the group here shown.
  Tbere are three dark holes; the middle 
one is the cave. The opening is just lasrge
enough to admit a man, and the entrance
looks very damp and dripping. Inside,
however, all is quite dey and the floor
is covered with dry brown bones.
8985
  Surrounded by dry bones, I lunched 
in the cave by the candle's flckering
gleam.
  The two horizontal lines in rhe 
sketch represent Loch Luichart as seen
from the cave. After leaving the cave I
went round Scour Ronach and up the
east face, where I had a steep climb
over the slippery ground, after being
obliged to go on hands and knees.

  Speed's description is remarkably
like what is there now. Block A is
the most conspicuous rock from Ach-
analt on the front of a small ter-
race-like projection of the mount-
ain. It is at the foot of the "cairn",
actually a jumbled mass of coarse
scree, blocks up to c. 15 ft across.
These are heavily lichenized and evi-
dently very stable, though we found
one block that had fallen from
the cliff behind and shattered
within the last year or so.
  Fig. 1 is an accurate representa-
tion of the cliffs of the N. side of
Glas Leathaid.
  In Fig. 2 all the blocks can
still be recognized without difficulty.

actual cave. The shape of the

mouth and the small boulders hold-
ing up the roof-slab on the left are
unmistakeable.
  The only change is that most 
of the grass mentioned in the text 
and on the figures is now dom-
inated by Vaccinium and evidently
somewhat taller than in 1885.
The cave is about 15 ft dia.,
6 ft max. height. Formed by one
huge boulder propped up against
others. Rather damp; has holes in
roof between the boulders. The floor
is now mainly earth, but gentle
probing produced several sheep
bones and a few of rodents.

spruce. Much of the site has
been replanrted, but a broad

  Loch Dailfhearne is a notable
fishing loch. Although very remote
and far from a road it used to
have a boat. The remains of
the boathouse, of stout galvan-
ized corrugated iron painted
orange, are still to be seen;
mucb of the timber frasme - ap-
parently untreated deal - is still
sound although partly collapsed.
The name means "place of

  Fannich is one of the looeliest
lochs of its size in Scotland.
Fannish Lodge is the only inhab-

  Many small valley-bogs and
treacherous streams on the plateau

  The Redthroated Loon seen on 
Loch na Curra (p. 8997) is a
strange and terrible bird with
a remarkable cry. It has no

  The chambered cairn is a 
low grassy hillside, perhaps natu-
ral, with a number of boulders\
projecting c. 6 ft from it - set
on their short axes.  There is 
no sign that it ever had a de-
finite barrow, or what happened
to the material if there was one.
Charles MacBurney says the 
Neolithic chambered  tombs of this
area typically occur in round
rather than long barrows.
  In a commanding position at
the frontier of cultivation - roughly
tho' not in detail, at the edge of
Old Red Sandstone. Within sight

  Oak beside road, NW of Loch-
luichart Lodge, is good robur with
