   The grassland around the
B and C exclosures has become
thick and tussocky over many
years. The characteristic herbs
are not easily seen but most
of them can be found by dili-
gent search.
   Many pines have been cut
down in the last few years in
the area of grassland A.
[18956-18957]
8956
   Moderate frost damage to
bracken, which has crippled fronds
in many areas but has not set
off any replacement.

Kingmere. Water covers about 1/3
of bottom. Wide Phalaris zone.
Fenmere. About half of mud is
water-coveerd. Hornbeams un-
altered.

one seen) has no water. The zones
on p. 8958 are from this basin.

noticed.

  Beeches at Cadsden are still
severely chlorotic, hardly altered
from last year. Occsional trees
dead. Symptoms abundant in
shallow-rendzina woods; those on
plateau soils apparently un-
affected. Probably no symptoms
in Lodge Wood (Prestwood).
  One plant of Atropa seen in
valley at Cadsden.
Valley bottoms at Cadsden
are still largely grssland;
little evidence of encroaching
trees. Arrhenatheretum.

  Monitropa: one plant.
  Oudemansiella radicata:
two seen.
  Surface is rather uneven.
Beech litter is drifted by wind
& collects in hollows and espe-
cially on both sides of the plan-
tation-fence. Litter up to 9"
deep in hollows, over mull.
  Replanted area (c. 10 y ago)
was felled and planted with Cir-
sicem. Establishment very
patchy, much of the pine only
3 ft high. Area becoming 
dominated by ash. Sallow
ab. despite shallow rendzina
soil (aspect approx. N).
Such ashes asoccur in
the rendzina beechwoods are
8967
mostly in good condition,
though osme of the bigger ones]
suffer from foliage-bleaching.
  Extensive attemopts at
replanting on plateau aoils
further S.E.

Patch of loess.
  At the top of the spur
on which the shallow-rendzina
woods are demonstated is
a solitary oak (Q. robur).
Small patch (c. 10 yds across),
of mor soil in a level break
in the slope. Mnium hornum,
Oxalis acetosella, Luzula
pilosa (otherwise unknown in
the rendzina beechwoods).

  The richest flora is at the 
plateau edge, where occa-
sional chalk fragments are
visible in the soil, esp. in the
vicinity of woodbanks & hollo-
ways.  Trees include hazel as
well as ash. Hordelymus ab.
Mercury and Rubus corylif.
Fragaria.
  At one place, on the edge
of the S.E. replanted areas,
the fall of a beech reveals
some 2 ft of apprarently ty-
pical cwF over chalk. But
nearby grow foxgloves.

Pulpit Hill.
  Beeches in the same very
chlorotic state as before. No
further deaths. One dead tree

is conspicuously epinastic in
branchs up to c. 4" dia. (cf

ease).

Chalk grass-
land is slightly
more bushed over tasn
last year (when clearing
work had veen done). Grass
rather long (c. 4-5") and
weakly tussocky, but most
herbs survive. No Herminium
seen.
  Ex-arable little altered.
Anacamptis ab. (not seen on
chalk grassland). Turf still
largely composed of herbs other
than grasses.
[18970-18971]
8970
Juniper bushes in scrub are 
old and havew apparently
recovere3d from a phase of
decline. One jujiper seenin
ex-arable.

Phytophthora. Old symptoms
seen on many beeches. None
new.

Beech seedlings. One of this year.
None of last year's seem to have
survived.

   Lodge Wood.
Young generaton of beeches
still making very slow growth.
No distinct B horizon visible
in poidsol.
  Gleying is rather indistinct.
[18972-18973]
8971
  The only beech seedlings
are in the soil pit, where there
are several of 2-3 years' growth
in places where dead leaves col-
lect. None of this year's or last
year's germination.

   Berkhamsted Common
  The slopes above Northchurch
are mainly hawthorn succession
with much bracken. Frequency
of pioneer oak increases north-
wards. Birch not abundant
till the plateau is reached.
  Some old beeches, perhaps
derived from hedges, on earth-
works on the northern part
of the Common.

  The elms in Harmer-Green
Wood are hardly touched by

been snapped off about

Saturday, Novwmber 21st. A thaw ad
set in so I thought skating in water was
not good enough. I crossed the river
with the Berthon boat [i.e. the R. Bran

looked well at the place through the
