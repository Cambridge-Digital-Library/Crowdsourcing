Grassland A.
One seedling pine (2-3 y) in
exclosure
Silene olites flowering abundantly
in exclosure. One plant in soil
pit, c. 12 ft from a rabbit hole.
Botrychium: c. 200 fronds in
exclosure. 2-3 depauperate or
eaten-down outside S.E. corner.

Grassland B.

plants in neighbourhood of soil
pit. Quite ab to N., among
sparse pines.
   Euphrasia nemorosa - now
quite ab. esp. among pines.
   Boletus bovinus - v. ab.
among pines, with trees only c. 12 y
old, extending some 15 ft from
trees (well beyond canopy).
Asperula particularly in area
with many moles.

   The grassland around the
B and C exclosures has become
thick and tussocky over many
years. The characteristic herbs
are not easily seen but most
of them can be found by dili-
gent search.
   Many pines have been cut
down in the last few years in
the area of grassland A.
[18956-18957]
8956
   Moderate frost damage to
bracken, which has crippled fronds
in many areas but has not set
off any replacement.
------------------------------------
Kingmere. Water covers about 1/3
of bottom. Wide Phalaris zone.
Fenmere. About half of mud is
water-coveerd. Hornbeams un-
altered.
Langmere. The S.E. basin (the only
one seen) has no water. The zones
on p. 8958 are from this basin.
  Deschampsia flexuosa is now
dominant over many acres S.E.
of Langmere. No rabbit activity
noticed.

  Rabbits are rather fewer than
usual, but grassland still very short.
Type A occurs quite extensively
on and near spoil-heaps of old
flint-mines on  plateau. B and
C are distinguishable descending
the slope. There is a small area
of D in the bottom.

Grime's Grsves Plantation. Upturned
trees still visible.
Thetford Heath. Stripes very clear
(e.g. Leotodon tarox. on deep sand)
in heath and in roadside verge. An
area has just been plowed to de-
monstrate the underlying chalk &
sand strips.

  Beeches at Cadsden are still
severely chlorotic, hardly altered
from last year. Occsional trees
dead. Symptoms abundant in
shallow-rendzina woods; those on
plateau soils apparently un-
affected. Probably no symptoms
in Lodge Wood (Prestwood).
  One plant of Atropa seen in
valley at Cadsden.
Valley bottoms at Cadsden
are still largely grssland;
little evidence of encroaching
trees. Arrhenatheretum.

than usual.

seen.
  Monitropa: one plant.
  Oudemansiella radicata:
two seen.
  Surface is rather uneven.
Beech litter is drifted by wind
& collects in hollows and espe-
cially on both sides of the plan-
tation-fence. Litter up to 9"
deep in hollows, over mull.
  Replanted area (c. 10 y ago)
was felled and planted with Cir-
sicem. Establishment very
patchy, much of the pine only
3 ft high. Area becoming 
dominated by ash. Sallow
ab. despite shallow rendzina
soil (aspect approx. N).
Such ashes asoccur in
the rendzina beechwoods are
8967
mostly in good condition,
though osme of the bigger ones]
suffer from foliage-bleaching.
  Extensive attemopts at
replanting on plateau aoils
further S.E.

Patch of loess.
  At the top of the spur
on which the shallow-rendzina
woods are demonstated is
a solitary oak (Q. robur).
Small patch (c. 10 yds across),
of mor soil in a level break
in the slope. Mnium hornum,
Oxalis acetosella, Luzula
pilosa (otherwise unknown in
the rendzina beechwoods).
