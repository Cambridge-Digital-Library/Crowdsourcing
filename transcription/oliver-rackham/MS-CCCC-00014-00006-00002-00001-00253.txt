The Roman Road past [???]Maesbury[???]
castle is relatively wide, mostly
with [???]sincious[???] hedges [!!!]having 3-4[!!!]some mixed, some
[!!!]species[!!!] apparently of ash and hazel only.

The weather suddenly became much warmer in the night and
most of the snow melted - 
leaving, however, great drifts in
places.

Heavy rain all morning.

A thunderstorm with lightning was encountered in the Stoke west 
wood.

A sudden cold front then came
with brilliant sunshine. Magnificent
view of Glastonbury Tor. Fine sun-
set.

Dolomitic Conglomerate is a
very distinctive stone - multicoloured,
chiefly gray, pebbles in a hard 
red-pink matrix - much used for doorsteps and in buildings.

At Axbridge a number of
powerful springs arise from fissures
in the limestone and supply
two (disused) public troughs for
washing of clothes.

Cheddar Gorge
The River Yeo emerges from one
of the great caverns and is dammed
to form a lake.

22 jan.
No snow in Cambridge.

23 jan. 
Weather damp and only just above freezing [???] rain.

24 jan.
Heavy snowfall all day. Despite 
the realatively warm ground lay
4"deep by evening. Because of 
strikes no grit or salt was put  on 
the roads, so the snow lay on 
streets such as silver street and 
Trumpington street.

25 jan.
Slow thaw. Slush on smooth
ice on [!!!]Silver[!!!] Sidgwick Avenue,
 Trumpington Street, and elsewhere. 
 On a cycle the least sideways
 movement became uncontrollable
 and cyclists were falling off in 
 
 
 many places. 
 Quite heavy rain in the after-
 noon, which failed to melt the 
 snow on branches of trees.
 The rain turned to snow and by 
 evening the snow was again 4" 
 thick.
 The river has been in slight 
 spate and has not tended to 
 freeze.
 
 26 jan.
Most roads, exept for some in
the middle of town, are still un-
heated and are polshed ice. Dr
Tubbs, leaving harston at 8 am.
for a 9 am. lecture, arrived at 
9.40; the road was blocked with 
many cars that slid into the gutter 
and could not climb up the camber.
