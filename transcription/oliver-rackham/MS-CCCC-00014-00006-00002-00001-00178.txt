[13425]
[DIAG] 26 JULY 1970
In the Stansfield Beck
valley below Purton Green is a 
fine tract of unreclaimed fen.
Hawkedon has an excellent
long narrow green N.E. of the
church.
The Glem valley beween 
Denston and Long Melford is
exceptionally fine hilly country-
side. The valley has a 
narrow flat bottom broadening
below, with large unimproved
water-meadows, especially
between Hawkedon and Gallow-
gate and around Boxted.
Steep hillsides with much
permanent grass.  Most of
the hedges are unusually
massive, with many species,

[13426]
both along the roads and else-
where.
Scotchford Wood (839492)[!!!!].[!!!!]
and Calves Wood ( 856485) exist
as in 1835 and are apparently
3-layered. Both on steep slopes.
Lumpit Wood, Glemsford,
exists.
Numerous poplar plantations
in the Chad Brook Valley, Long
Melford and Acton.
In the Glem basin, Humu-
lus is frequent in hedges and
often climbs the wire stays to
telegraph poles.

[13427]
Tiger Hill
Polytrichum piliferum
on heathland.
Cladonia squamosa
ibid.
Holcus mollis ibid.
Clad. impexa ibid.
Corydalis claviculata
edge of heath
Camanula rotun
large glade, Kedge's
Stellania gramina
Kedge's
Teucriun  heath & edge of wood
Galium saxatile  heath

[13428]
Angelica abundant in
valley of stream beside house.
Tiger Hill A
Middle is open grass-
land on gravel. Dominated
mainly by Agrostis tenuis
& Holcus mollis. Numer-
ous overgrown but inhabited 
anthills.
Much Ruruex tenuifoli[????]
in interstices between
grass tussocks.
Deschampsia flexuosa
ab. in patches.
No invasion by birch.
Much invasion by oak.
Ages up to c. 10 years,
with a few isolated older

[13429]
[DIAG]

[13430]
trees & groups of c. 30
years. Young trees are
somewhat eaten and often
killed by drought this year.
Cover of oaks is not
serious at present but will
need attention.
Heath lichens are in-
frequent because of too
complete grass cover. Mainly
under the edge of the ca-
nopy of the older oaks.
The heath is every-
where surrounded by a
belt of bracken, mostly
on sloping ground. Bracken
apparently about 3ft high.
Boundary with heathland
abrupt [???] isolated fronds
[13431]
few, rather small, yellowish.
Appears to be static.
The bracken-grass junction
is often occupied by brambles.
A patch of Corydalis claviculata
was seen in the S.W. part,
growing over brambles & bracken.
In the N.E. and S.W. parts
are large stands of broom,
over-mature plants up to 
8ft high. About 3/4 of these
are dead (perhaps owing to
the severe winter). The survi-
vors, even where partly killed,
are growing vigorously. Dr Grace
Grifith said this was to be
expected and they would re-
generate. There is as yet 
no sign of seedlings or coppice.

[13432]
The ground under the dead
bushes is densely occupied
chiefly with Rumex tenuifol-
ius. These appear to be an
even-aged stand - p erhaps
resulting from myxomatosis-
which has got over-mature.
Rabbit and fox droppings
are numerous. No holes seen.
Orobanche Rapum-genistae
was not found and has not
been seen this year.
Dicranum scoparium and
Polytrichum piliferum occasional.
Soil appears to be sand
with occasional gravel. Hardly
any podsolization.

[13433]
Tiger Hill B.
This belongs (unlike T.H. A)
to the Griffith property. The
N.W. part is not differentiated
from T.H.A. and separated
from it solely by a track.
The remainder slopes down into
the valley where the cottage
stands.
Small grass-heath zone.
Bracken belt. The rest is
brambles, particularly tall and
said to be prized for the fruit.
The bramble zone has many
middle-sized oaks, and is
modified by more or less over-
grown lawns and former
cultivated patches. It was 
evidently managed in former

[13434]
years, but during Dr Griffith's
husband's last illness and after
his death has evidently been ne-
glected.
Foxgloves frequent.
Both cottages appear to be 
of c. 1870. No visible trace of
the brick-kiln said to have
existed near Cottage A. [!!!!]
Among the brambles at
the side of the valley are
numerous spiders'-webs of 
an unusual complex funnel
[DIAG]
shape leading to a narrow

[13435]
hole, with many threads
strung across the wide part of
the funnel or herbage [????]
in front of it.
Tiger Hill Wood.
Not visited directly. On
a steep slope down to a beck.
Appears to be rather patchy,
with oaks and occasional
Castanea, the latter middle
aged but markedly dying
at the top. Margin diffuse.
Probably no coppice; under-
growth chiefly bracken.
Cottage B. Dr Grace Griffith's
home, where she died.
Small, complex, and over-

[13436]
grown garden, with numerous
planted trees. Convallaria
and Dryopteris spinulosa.
There is a well down
tot he London Clay which
is a few feet below the sur-
face.
Various presumably
planted trees in and around
the garden include Tilia
vulgaris and Sorbus aria.
1.903 Acres
A deep little valley with
a [!!!!]spring[!!!!] stream at the
bottom fed by springs at the
top of the London Clay.
The stream contains water-
cress.

[13437]
Beside the stream is a
little fen, with dominant
Epilobium hirsutum and
patches of nettles some 4ft
high. Said to have been
cultivated.
The E. slope is a wood
of Ulmus carpinifolia agg.,
apparently much disturbed,
probably by felling oaks
in the 1930s (Dr G.G.'s daugh-
ter described the devastation
of the Assington Estate). [????]Fas ash [????].
No aks left. Dense
bluebells of great size.  Much
bracken. The fen - wood transition
is steep and very interesting.
Carex remota Digitalis
Angelica

[13438]
Dryopteris borreri
This valley is so abrupt
that at first sight it looks
artificial. A large pit is
shown at its N. end on the
O.S.  But the house, said to
be a brickmakers' cottage,
stands in it, and most
of the excavation is into
gravel, not the London Clay
which was used for the
bricks. So it may well be
mainly a natural valley.
The bluebells and Cx remota
suggest it is an ancient
fragment of woodland; a
slope so steep might well
have retained some trees
and woodland flora when

[13439]
the surrounding were
heathland. It was not a 
regular wood: no coppice
structure, and apparently
no wood-bank; the boun-
dary with Kedge's has a
slight bank or none (tall
bracken in this area
made this point obscure).
Kedge's Wood.
A very complex area.
In the N.E. corner is
a group of even-aged Pinus
sylvestris about 1ft dia.,
shown on the O.S. as a 
rectangular unfenced com-
partment. Bracken under.
No invasion of other areas.


[13440-13441]
A glade of about 1 1/2
ac. occupies the N.E. part.
Middle is grass heath.
Mainly Agrostis tenuis. More
trampled than Tiger Hill and
without the bryophtes & li-
chens. Herbs not found in 
Tiger Hill include:
Teucrium
Stellaria graminea
Galium saxatile
Campanula rotundifolia
Around the margin is
a bramble zone renowned
for its fruit. Corydalis pre-
sent. Slow spread into the
grass heath.
Neither the grass nor the
brambles is being invaded

[13441)
by trees.
In the S. is a bracken
glade with bracken about
5 ft high. Bracken forms
the ground dominant in
much of the woodland and
is a pure stand in places
at the wood - bramble mar-
gin.
The rest of the com-
partment is deciduous
woodlan. Mainly elm.
Ulmus procera is nearly
pure in the S*. Along
the E. side the elm conforms
to that in the 1.903 acres,
which may be a different
species, and is mixed
with a minority of young
* Ash stool in S. boundary: V. infra.

[13442-13443]
to middle-aged oaks & ash.
Much oak is said to have
been felled in the 1930s
but we saw no stumps.
Elms uneven-aged, up
to c. 2 1/2 ft dia., suckering,
not aggressive towards oaks
or non-woodland.
No coppice; little under-
-storey.
Ground flora poor. Blue-
bells pure in parts of the S.,
very large. Bracken general.
Nettles patchy.
Boundary nowhere a 
proper woodbank. To the
W. it so very slight. to the
roads N. and E. there is
a slight hedge-bank with
[13443]
boundary pollards. In the
N. half of the E. side this
bank was made in the last
few years to keep cars off
the glade: a boundary pol-
lard is submerged by the
bank. In the S. half of
this side the road goes
down a steep slope on the
clay and is deeply sunk.
To the S.there is little or
no bank.
Soil mainly [????]mull[????].
As a wood this has
hardly any ancient features
and must date from c. 1800
("Kedge's Plantation", 1st ed. O.S.).
The glade appears to be
a relatively old feature

[13444-13445]
and relatively stable; it may
never have had trees.
A very few rowans and
birches in this wood; both
are rare in the whole
system. One birch is a probable
hybrid: habit of pubescens,
glabrous pale- - warty twigs, bark
of pubescens, leaves intermediate.
Other birches pubescens.
Roads and pollards.
The Assington-Smallbridge
Hall road (certainly ancient,
? Roman) has an ancient
hedge on its W. side with
pollards from Moor's Farm
southwards. Two of these, both oaks, are on the Tiger
[13445]
Hill estate. The N. one, by
the glade, is about 8ft X
1 1/2 ft, quite vigorous, pollarded
fairly recently (brances c. 4 in.
dia.), overshadowed by a 
neighbouring young oak. The
S. one (a few yards from
the road in the S. boundary
of the wood) is larger,
much decayed on the wood
side but otherwise vigorous,
secondarily pollarded at
apparently the same time as
the first, overtopped by a
gigantic stool ash in the
wood boundary.
Similar pollards of ash
and oak N. of the wood.
The short road along the

[13446-13447]
N. of Kedge's has ash & elm
pollards on both sides. Usu-
ally c. 2ft X 8ft.
Woods E. of the road.
A complex area, mainly
conifers in the N. (a late
19th cent. planting on former
open land). In the S.
elms, partly on an old pit.
The elms appear to have 
spread by suckering from ori-
ginal trees in an old hedge.
This follows the line of
the road but at one point
curves away from it, appar-
ently leading into an old
entrance. The triangle of land so formed, now over-
[13447]
grown, is marked as high-
way on the 1st ed. O.S.
Arger Fen
S.E. of the ford is a
complex area of valley fen.
Part of it is planted with
bat-willows; part is "natural" 
alder carr. Still a few acres
of open fen.
Arger Fen Wood.
Planted and poisoned by the F.C. Numerous large
cherries survive and appear 
to be the dominant tree.
Dr Grace Griffith.

she was writing a manage-
ment plan while recovering
from an accident, and which
was interrupted by her death
- she broke off in the middle
of a word and never re-
sumed - she refers to dor-
[13451]
mice and stick insects.
She referred to the return
of glow-worms this year
after many years' absence.
A swallow's (s.str.) nest
was pointed out placed
like an house-martin's at
the junction of wall and
gable eaves of a wooden
shed.
Dutch-elm disease was
moderately severe on a few
of the elms in Kedge's.

The main wood (Mole-pit
Wood) has been coniferized
and poisoned.
At the Babergh* Place
cross-roads, Great Walding-
field (908442) is a single
tree of Tilia cordata on
an island in the road. A
pollard c. 10ft X 1 1/2 ft. Cut
many years ago. Very dense
basal shoots. Typical size,
shape, & bluish colour of
leaves. Tree is over-mature,
stag-headed, and some of
the upper branches have
broken off and lodged pre-
cariously in the crown. Sur-
* of Babergh Hundred.
[13453]
[DIAG]
viving part is
fairly slourishing,
tho' somewhat
chlorotic, and flowering
freely.
[DIAG]

[13454-13455]
Good hedges on both sides
of the road between Great
Waldingfield and Newton.
The giant oak pollard
near Burton's Farm, Long Melford,
has lost a small branch in a 
recent storm.

August 2. Bot.Gardens.
Corylus colurna. The huge

sive limbs (one recently re-
moved). Mycelial sheet under
part of the bark.
Enteromorpha. Masses in the

One hedgehog in Leckhamp-
ton, moving with surprising speed
in the horsechestnut avenue,
about 11 p.m.
[13458-13459]
Ann Burn's experiment,
August 4.      Weeting.
The experimental barley field
at Weeting crawls with lady-
bird larvae of various sizes.
They scurry around very actively.
Estimated density about 3
per sq foot. Only one aphid
was seen, although infestation
mayhave been much heavier.
No food for the ladybirds was
seen, and although they often
met one another they took no
notice and did not appear to
be eating each other. Pupae
much less frequesnt. Adults
quite rare. The larva when
pupating seizes a stem or leaf
very firmly in its jaws, later
cementing itself down by the 
[13459]
[DIAG]

[13460-13461]
tail and releasing the jaws.
The field is about 11 acres
of sandy breck fenced with
a rabbit fence about a year
ago. This fence has been
much dug under and there
are rabbit scrapes and
even burrows on the fallow
and the barley.
About 9 acres are plowed,
leaving a broad frassland
margin to the N. and nar-
rower margins S. and E.
About 8 ac. are sown, with
a fallow margin all round.
The N. part of the field
shows fairly clear stripes of
alternating Holcus mollis &
[13461]
[DIAG]
Reseda lutea. A shallow 
valley runs across the
middle. S. of this is deep

[13462-13463]
sand with rather indistinct
"letters of the alphabet" fea-
tures.
Across the stripes, and
running into the heathland
to the W., is a broad shallow
warren bank said to be mainly
blown sand. A large pit is
just outside the field to the
W.
Barley is Sultan, which
has shorter straw than Proctor
and curved inverted ears.
Area A has a normal
tho' light crop (sown c. April 1).
About 2 1/2 ears per plant.
Aborted tillers few, ratoons
rare. Weeds mainly peren-
nials from previous grassland;
[13463]
Holcus mollis, Agropyron
repens, Pastinaca. Severe smut.
Area C has a totally
failed crop. Tillers produced
but all dead. Main ears
also mainly dead; a few
have emerged but even
these seldom have any full
grains. Seed probably not
recovered. Late tillers profuse,
mostly with ears at the A
stage and sometimes emerged.
Little weed growth. [????] 21 [!!!!]
B is intermediate, with
usually a main ear small
but having some full grass,
all the tillers dead, and nu-
merous late tillers now in the
A stage.    [????] 22

[13464-13465]
A is generally yellow,
C glaucous, and B interme-
diate. There are numerous
differences in detail associ-
ated with differential fertilizer
apreading and with soleflux-
ion; C is very variable and
has yellowish-green patches.
B and C have numer-
ous fibrous roots from the
late tillers, absent from A.
Soil differences not alto-
gether clear. A is on
sand with chalk fragments;
a hole down to 2 1/2 ft did
not reach any chalky till.
B and C appear to be on
deeper more acid sand.
A is associated with abun-
[13465]
dant Pastinaca and Polygo-
num convoluvulus in the 
adjoining fallow, and with 
Pastinaca in the grassland.
Drilling runs parallel to 
the edges of the field. Drill
has 10 coulters; in every
other drill width row 5 is
missing or almost missing.
[DIAG]

[13466-13467]
Sample plots are 1/2 m.
long and run from drill
widh 4, row 5 (counting inwards)
from edge of sowing) to 
row 5 of drill width 6. They
thus comprise 19 rows, some-
times reduced to 18 because
row 10 of D.W.4 sometimes
coincides with row 1 of D.W.
5.
Surrounding heath (in-
side the fence) is a turf of
Agrostis tenuis, Agropyron cani-
num, Holcus mollis, &c. with
numerous other plants. Some
bracken in the N.E. and
much Cx arenaria in the S.W.
In the fallow, most of
[13467]
the perennials come through,
except Agnostis tenuis which
is much reduced.
Annual weeds have
mostly failed to germinate,
Ornithopus and Veronica
spp and Trifolium campestre
are frequent in the fallow &
corn, but have made very
little growth since germinating.
Note no ericoids in the 
area.
Silene otites sown by Mrs
Crompton in an experimental
plot has germinated well.
Rabbits have walked over
the plot and scraped in it
but have not eaten the seed-
lings.

[13468-13469]
Immediately N. of the
field is an outlier of Belve-
dere Wood, mainly beech. A
belt of Scots separates this
from the field. A few isolated
Scots occur in the N. grassy
part of the field. It is
said that the N. part of the
field was wooded until re-
cently. There cannot have
been more than scattered
pines in the last 30-40
years, because the pines
at the edge of the wood and
the scattered trees all have 
branches low down.
The whole of the field
is shown as wood on the
1st ed. 1 in.  The names Nel-
[13469]
son, Wellington, &c. suggest an
early 19th cent. origin. To 
the E. is a broom area
with 2 miserable larches on
the E. edge. Suggested se-
quence:
1.(c.1910) Wood (beech + larch?)
planted.
2. Wood is felled or (more likely)
fails except for the surviv-
ing beeches & larches.
3. Pine belt planted.
4. Second-generation pines
colonize the area of the
present field.
5. Area brought under cult-
vation (World War II?) and
most of the pines felled.
6. (c.1955) Cropping aban-

[13470-13471]
doned and area reverts to 
heath.
To the W. is the grass
heath of Weeting Heath
with no obvious boundary
feature.
To the E. is a tract of 
bracken & broom. Bushes
to c. 10ft high, mostly recently
dead, as at Tiger Hill.
Further E. is a sugar
beet field. Establishment
sparse. Abundant weeds in
gaps: Chenopodium album has
nearly as much cover as the
beet; also Sisymbrium so-
phia. Beet badly wilted and
stunted.
Belts fringe the road,
[13471]
except (? significantly) on
the experimental field. They
are Scots in a single row,
apparently derived from a
hedge.
S. of the road is a
wider belt partly Scots,
partly (older) Corsican. The
latter has dense elder for-
ming a closed understorey.
In these belts and surround-
ding grassland:
Acinos ubundant
Lactuca virosa (conf. D.E.C.)
2 plants
1 oak seedling, c. 1 year
(no oaks within sights!).
Cynoglossum is extremely
abundant in the N. part

[13472-13473]
of the experimental field,
especially under pines.
Stone curlew heard at Weeting. 
Wheatears seen.
Fengate Farm, Weeting, home
of Mr Parrott, the owner of much
of the land around the field
who has done the cultivation,
is a 19th-cent. farm. Much
permanent grass in the Little
Ouse valley. 12 traction engines.
The Drove at Weeting
is a broad road betweeen
species-poor hedges (mainly
Ulmus hollandica).
At WIlton is a fine medi-
eval stone cross on a pedestal;
it has a deeply fluted shaft.
At Eriswell Hall is a remark-
able free-standing Perpendicu-
[13473]
lar chapel, apparently largely
complete and roofed, in the
middle of a field.
Eriswell Lode is a narrow
drain, now almost dry,
beside the Cut-off Channel
but apparently unaffected
by it.
In the Eriswell valley
bottom are large areas of 
permanent frass pasture,
largely unimproved, which
adjoin directly the usual
Breckland heaths, plantations,
and arable.
Mildenhall has a remark-
able medieval market cross,
a hexagonal roof standing
on massive original corner

[13474-13475]
posts let directly into the ground.
Where the B1102 crosses
the Devil's Ditch, in the N.
quadrant of the intersection, is
a stand of about 30 plants
of corn-cockle. They grow
in two groups in a small
unsown bit of ground at
the edge of a field. Flower-
ing veryfreely. With Papa-
ver hybridum. Mr Jim
Clarke, who farms this land,
is said to have found a
single plant last year and
to have encouraged it. [????]

August 5.
Only Papaver rhoeas
has been seen this year
[13475]
at Trumpington.
Specularia has been found
several times.
August 6.
Ipornoea is growing slowly
and is reluctant to flower
although it has produced buds.
August 7.
The last few days have
been hot and very humid
with sinister black clouds
hanging about and mingling
with ground mist. Heavy
distant thunder today.
On the W. side of Trum-
pington Road, shortly be-
fore the last houses, seve-
ral trees are being felled
in the old belt which bor-

[13476-13477]
ders the road. They include
an elm about 80 ft high
X 2 1/2 ft dia. This tree has
wet-wood throughout. Af-
fected wood deep chocolate
brown, wet to the touch,
slight smell, separated by
a narrow orange zone from
the yellowish unaffected
wood. On a branch of
c. 8 in. dia. the whole cross-
section was affected exept
for a shell of about 3/4 in.
Similarly for other upper
branches. Extends into small
branches of c. 1 1/2 in. dia.
No leaf symptoms or surface
exudation. Effects on trunk
not yet seen. A possible
[13477]
related feature is the ex-
tremely slow growth, the
annual rings on the branch
mentioned being c.1/8 in. wide.
This tree is undoubtedly
over 150 years old and
must be part of the original
planting of the belt. There
are several similar elms
in the Cambridge half of
the belt. All are procera.
Other and younger elms
are carpinifolia, hollandica,
and ? glabra. Some of these
show stem fluxes, but not 
seriously nor with flanges.
The procera trees do not appear
to sucker.
A large oak near this

[13478-13479]
elm is being felled and
another has been damaged.
In each case a large branch
has serious cubical dry
rot in the interior. No trace of
wet-wood.
August 9.
Thunder-flies are abund-
ant at Trumpington.
August 11.
A hot close day with dis-
tant thunder.
August 12.
Ladybirds are numerous
at Trumpington, though in 
much smaller numbers than
at Weeting. Mostly adults.
August 13.
A very hot close day with
[13480]
numerous rainstorms visible
in the distance.
August 14
The barley crop after cutting
is full of weevils about 4mm
long.
August 15.
The Fanshawe beech is
noticeably dying back in its
outer crown twigs.
Lamium amplexicaule occurs
in the barley field at Trumpington.

[13480-13481]
August 21.
Bradfield Woods (with Philip
Tubbs: butterflies)
Fontinalis hangs in tufts
from all the stools and tree
bases around Hewitt's Pond,
about 3ft above the present
water level.

The badger sett in the elm
area has c.6 holes in a

earth. Used recently but no
sign of present occupation.
The internal earthworks are
very complex. the 223∘ ditch of
p. 3497 was shown to run
about 2/3 of the way through the
wood and then stop suddenly
just short of a minor ride.
The 210∘ ditch appears to
be a drainage grip from a
ride ditch; it is quite deep
in places, apparently to ensure
a fall.
Several oaks, including a
pollard, in the S. boundary strip,

[13502-13503]
are dead, apparently prisoned,
and th strip itself has been
cut back and is choked with
Prunus scrub.
The two ponds in the 
S.E. reentrant are about 6ft
apart (and must join when
the water is high). The larger
now has a small puddle; the
smaller is empty. Fontinalis
hangs from trees around the
smaller pond. This pond is
higher and shallower than the
other. They belong to different 
ditch systems.
Cherry is abundant as
pole-sized trees along the
S.E. ege.
Boundary pollards of the

wood are oaks (except one maple),
about 3ft X 6ft, very like those

Bull's Wood has probably
undergone additions and sub-
tractions. The E. half of the
S. boundary is proved by the
O.S. to be a modern subtrac-
tion, and this is shown by its
slight ditch and earthwork
intersections. The rest of the
S. boundary (not quite straight)
is a less clear subtraction.
The N. boundary may also be

[13510-13511]
a subtraction; the very slight
ditch cuts bigger internal
earthqorks. The W. boundary,
although the bank is slight, is
reversed - S and probably early.

5 This looks like an old
road, and has almost certainly
been used as a drift (but
it is rather too wide). It

An area of small fields
with ancient hedges and
numerous pollard oaks.

[13514-13515]
Thorpe Green farm is in
a large moat behind which is
a bushy field full of old
machinery.
The pollards between this
farm and Bull's Wood are
mainly oaks, a few elm and
maple. Varying in size but
none very big. They appear
nearly all to have been
pollarded in the last 60 years
and a few within 10 years.
Growth after pollarding is
very slow.  [????]30
There is a traadition that
each farm worker was
allotted certain trees for pol-
larding for his fuel.

the hedges appear to be
treated as coppice: allowed
to grow tall and then felled
to the ground. This is said
to be a local tradition. Be-

poles said to have been cut
in this way.
At Stone Corner, near Stone

Thorpe, and Cockfield is 
marked by a triangular standing
stone some 3ft high.
The pollards behind Thorpe
Green Farm are overtopped

Rake Heads.
Made with various numbers
of teeth, which are wooden
dowels, iron rose-nails (cut-nails
worked with a rose-head), or
lengths of stout galvanized wire.
The following operations apply
to a wooden head.
1. Rough sawing with circular
saw from seasoned ash billets of
c. 6in. dia.
2. Planing 2 vertical sides.
3. Drilling holes for teeth. An
automatic machine moves the
work so that each hole is drilled
in its proper place. The head
is plaed in a slider for the 
purpose. When finished the head
is ejected from the machine and 
[13521]
[!!!!]the slider[!!!!] is automatically re-
turned to the operator by a 
chute. 2 sliders normally in
operation.
4. Planing lower face of head.
5. Clamping head in a special
quick-release vice and inserting
teeth. Teeth wetted and tapped
home with a mallet. No glue. [????] 3.
6. Sawing & Planing back of head (with
tooth ends). All planing done
mechanically.
7. Trimming teeth to a chisel
point with a draw-knife, the
head being wedged in a frame
for the purpose.
8. Drilling holes for legs of
handle, a special former being 
used to get the correct angles.
[!!!!]Back[!!!!] Sides of head planed again.

[13522-13523]
9. Inserting legs of handle and

Rake Handles.
Sallow or birch poles; alder
is used for mop handles &c.
1. Heating poles in a steam
chest, a large double-walled
iron box fed with steam from
a wood-burning boiler. [????]11.
2. Poles are pulled out and
worked in wooden crotches ([????]33)
with 2 horizontal cross-bars
until straight. Most of a
man's weight is needed to
bend them. The bark has to 
be removed on the inside of
each bend to be made. [????]6,7.
3. When set, poles are sawn
if too thick with a circular
[13523]
saw to an octagonal section.
4. Handles placed in a horizon-
tal lathe along which a spoke-
shave* slides. [????]35,4.
5. Handle slit lengthwise with

Rake Teeth.
Made from ash, sallow, or
hazel.
1. Billets sawn to length.
2. Split (in two operations) by
a machine, adapted from an
old steam-engine, which
slides a heavy knife back &
forth against an end-stop. (A
gap of about 3/4" is left to 
protect the operator's fingers).

Several different patterns,
some ash, others birch.
1. Steaming as for handles.
2. Forcing into a mould, a 
heavy wooden frame with the
correct curves built in. Sets of
hooks and wedges ensure that
the handle is kept in the
correct position. [????]32. The
bends are established in turn

[13526-13527]
([????]8,9,10). The handles set for
several hours. Same precaution about barking inside of bends.
3. [!!!!]S[!!!!] Turning with a spoke-
shave ([????]34). The handles are
fed through this ([????]11,12), follow-
ing the curves. Several pas-
sages through diminishing sizes
needed, espevially if the handle
has to be tapered, as some do.
Spokeshave made from a block
of elm. A hand-rotated spoke-
shave* can also be used ([????]15),
the work being gripped between
horizontal bars.
4. Sanding & fitting the tacks.
Mallets (elm) and tent-pegs
