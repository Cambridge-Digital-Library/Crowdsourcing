[DIAG] 26 JULY 1970
In the Stansfield Beck
valley below Purton Green is a 
fine tract of unreclaimed fen.
Hawkedon has an excellent
long narrow green N.E. of the
church.
The Glem valley beween 
Denston and Long Melford is
exceptionally fine hilly country-
side. The valley has a 
narrow flat bottom broadening
below, with large unimproved
water-meadows, especially
between Hawkedon and Gallow-
gate and around Boxted.
Steep hillsides with much
permanent grass.  Most of
the hedges are unusually
massive, with many species,

[13426]
both along the roads and else-
where.
Scotchford Wood (839492)[!!!!].[!!!!]
and Calves Wood ( 856485) exist
as in 1835 and are apparently
3-layered. Both on steep slopes.
Lumpit Wood, Glemsford,
exists.
Numerous poplar plantations
in the Chad Brook Valley, Long
Melford and Acton.
In the Glem basin, Humu-
lus is frequent in hedges and
often climbs the wire stays to
telegraph poles.

[13427]
Tiger Hill
Polytrichum piliferum
on heathland.
Cladonia squamosa
ibid.
Holcus mollis ibid.
Clad. impexa ibid.
Corydalis claviculata
edge of heath
Camanula rotun
large glade, Kedge's
Stellania gramina
Kedge's
Teucriun  heath & edge of wood
Galium saxatile  heath

[13428]
Angelica abundant in
valley of stream beside house.
Tiger Hill A
Middle is open grass-
land on gravel. Dominated
mainly by Agrostis tenuis
& Holcus mollis. Numer-
ous overgrown but inhabited 
anthills.
Much Ruruex tenuifoli[????]
in interstices between
grass tussocks.
Deschampsia flexuosa
ab. in patches.
No invasion by birch.
Much invasion by oak.
Ages up to c. 10 years,
with a few isolated older

[13429]
[DIAG]

[13430]
trees & groups of c. 30
years. Young trees are
somewhat eaten and often
killed by drought this year.
Cover of oaks is not
serious at present but will
need attention.
Heath lichens are in-
frequent because of too
complete grass cover. Mainly
under the edge of the ca-
nopy of the older oaks.
The heath is every-
where surrounded by a
belt of bracken, mostly
on sloping ground. Bracken
apparently about 3ft high.
Boundary with heathland
abrupt [???] isolated fronds
[13431]
few, rather small, yellowish.
Appears to be static.
The bracken-grass junction
is often occupied by brambles.
A patch of Corydalis claviculata
was seen in the S.W. part,
growing over brambles & bracken.
In the N.E. and S.W. parts
are large stands of broom,
over-mature plants up to 
8ft high. About 3/4 of these
are dead (perhaps owing to
the severe winter). The survi-
vors, even where partly killed,
are growing vigorously. Dr Grace
Grifith said this was to be
expected and they would re-
generate. There is as yet 
no sign of seedlings or coppice.

[13432]
The ground under the dead
bushes is densely occupied
chiefly with Rumex tenuifol-
ius. These appear to be an
even-aged stand - p erhaps
resulting from myxomatosis-
which has got over-mature.
Rabbit and fox droppings
are numerous. No holes seen.
Orobanche Rapum-genistae
was not found and has not
been seen this year.
Dicranum scoparium and
Polytrichum piliferum occasional.
Soil appears to be sand
with occasional gravel. Hardly
any podsolization.

[13433]
Tiger Hill B.
This belongs (unlike T.H. A)
to the Griffith property. The
N.W. part is not differentiated
from T.H.A. and separated
from it solely by a track.
The remainder slopes down into
the valley where the cottage
stands.
Small grass-heath zone.
Bracken belt. The rest is
brambles, particularly tall and
said to be prized for the fruit.
The bramble zone has many
middle-sized oaks, and is
modified by more or less over-
grown lawns and former
cultivated patches. It was 
evidently managed in former

[13434]
years, but during Dr Griffith's
husband's last illness and after
his death has evidently been ne-
glected.
Foxgloves frequent.
Both cottages appear to be 
of c. 1870. No visible trace of
the brick-kiln said to have
existed near Cottage A. [!!!!]
Among the brambles at
the side of the valley are
numerous spiders'-webs of 
an unusual complex funnel
[DIAG]
shape leading to a narrow

[13435]
hole, with many threads
strung across the wide part of
the funnel or herbage [????]
in front of it.
Tiger Hill Wood.
Not visited directly. On
a steep slope down to a beck.
Appears to be rather patchy,
with oaks and occasional
Castanea, the latter middle
aged but markedly dying
at the top. Margin diffuse.
Probably no coppice; under-
growth chiefly bracken.
Cottage B. Dr Grace Griffith's
home, where she died.
Small, complex, and over-

[13436]
grown garden, with numerous
planted trees. Convallaria
and Dryopteris spinulosa.
There is a well down
tot he London Clay which
is a few feet below the sur-
face.
Various presumably
planted trees in and around
the garden include Tilia
vulgaris and Sorbus aria.
1.903 Acres
A deep little valley with
a [!!!!]spring[!!!!] stream at the
bottom fed by springs at the
top of the London Clay.
The stream contains water-
cress.
