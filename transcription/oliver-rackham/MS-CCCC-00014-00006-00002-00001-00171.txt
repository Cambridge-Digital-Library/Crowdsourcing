    Original length 3 1/2
 Tree 119 round
 
 Beech pollards mostly this
 size, some smaller.  In small
 groups, possibly in lines, in the
 bottom of the dry valley and in
 side-valleys and on the
 plateau to the E.
   Group A of the beeches is
 scattered among sycamore & coni-
 fers.  Little ground vegetation.
 

[12870-12871]
Chestnut coppice unevenaged,
some very old trees.
Some maiden std chestnuts to
c. 2 ft dia
Stool 87x23
  Vegetation between the Lion's
Mouth road and Group B of
the beeches.  Steep hillsides
above lat eral dry valleys.  Very
acid with sparse brambles and
bracken.  Chestnut coppice
very patchy.
  Alongside the Lion's Mouth
road are wood-bank-like banks
about 1 1/2 ft high, acute, very
overgrown with bryophytes, with
trees on them.
2871
Oak-Castanea wood
Nettles c. 2 1/2ft (4 ft in places).

Scattered groups of ancient
pioneer or pollard beech
Castanea, scattered old trees,
few younger.
Most oaks younger.
Few sycamore & Abies &
pine, prob c. 100 yrs old.
Beech gir 150" (some larger).
  Group B of the beeches
is in an old mixed wood.
Apart from the pollard beeches
([SYMBOL] 37) which resemble those of
Group A, the oldest trees are
probably the scattered oaks & 
chestnuts & perhaps the 
standard beech of pioneer form.


[12872-12873]
2872
[!!!!Beeches of !!!!] Undergrowth mostly of the
acid type, very sparse, with
some nettles in places.
   The N. side of Felbrigg
Great Wood (along the A148) has 
been encroached upon by recent
road-widening but appears not
to have had a wood-bank.
Much sycamore and conifers.
Maiden oak and beech of c.
100 years old or less,  No pol-
lards seen.
  The woods N. of the A148
are similar, with many exotics
and no old trees.
2873
        Group C, [SYMBOL] 1-4
Beech beyond end of Victory
Trees c. 3 ft dia., ?evenaged
Pollarded probably once c.
6 ft high.
Ground vegetation sparse bramble
& bracken.
large patches of polyr fom &
Mnium horn.

Beech with 170 rings at least
   One of the smaller pollard 
beeches, possibly the same age as
the rest.  Two large branches fell
off about a year ago and
have been sawn up.  Annual
rings very distinct but micro-
scopic:  c. 170 counted in the field
whence the true number (to the
last pollarding) will probably turn
        
[12874-12875]
2874
out at least 200.
   These beeches are probably
some 80 ft high.  No other trees
among them.  No regeneration.
Few beeches younger than
this.  They are at present almost
intact. though a few have large
brackets of Ganoderme applan-
atum at the base.
   Soil apparently all gravel.
Slight mor accumulation.  No
shrubs.
   The edges of this grove are
rather diffuse.  Other great
pollard beeches occur between
this wood and the park in
front of the house.  Some of
these are larger, perhaps
oftener pollarded, and with
2875
well-cut "Trajan's Column" letters
presumably of great age, visible
on the trunks.  Group D.
   Lichens rather sparse and
inconspicuous.

  Between the house and
Group C is a complex series
of woodlands.  Some Castanea
coppice in an overgrown pole
stage among huge non-pollard
pioneer oaks and beeches:
presumably an 18th-cent.
planting in a deer park.
Many very large Castanea
standards.  In addition there 
are numerous plantings of
Ketton-Cremer's time, of a[!!!!]
variety of species. The

[12876-12877]

Felbrigg Great Wood
[DIAG]

2877
   Victory Plantation was
intended in the shape of a 
V converging on a great
oak, but the latter has col-
lapsed.
  Group C is the largest
beech grove, an island in
other woodland.  Surroundings
mainly standard oak, a 
few of which are mixed
with the beeches.
  Group D are beeches
scattered among other mainly
much younger, trees.

Each group of pollard
beeches occurs on its own,
surrounded by other trees
all of which are clearly later.

[12878-12879]
2878
The beeches form closed com-
munities with little penetration
of other species and no under-
storey.  B and C are on the
flat gravel plateau, A in a
dry valley, D on steep slopes;
all very acid.
   The age of Group A, from
the rate of stretching, appears
to be at least 300 years.
This is consistent with last
pollarding c. 1770 (Group C).
   According to Ketton-Cremer's
Felbrigg, there was a deer park
and mature timber in quantity
on the estate in W. Windham
I's time (1675).  The wood was
apparently enlarged by plan-
ting by him and his suc-
2879
cessors, especially on the N. in
the late 18th cent. It is possible
that Windham planted the pol-
lard beeches;  but it is unlikely
that pollarding was started c.
1700 or that it would have
been applied to the beeches only.
A more probable sequence is:
Generation [SYMBOL]. 17th cent. or ear-
lier.  Present pollard beeches,
which then existed in at least
four groves, at least some of them
in open heathland.  (Group D is
on or near the site of "Old Wood",
1838 O.S.).
Generation [SYMBOL] The oldest sweet
chestnuts, oaks and perhaps non-
pollard beeches.  Those around
Group C, and perhaps Group B,
planted probably by W.W.I c. 1680

[12880-12881]
2880
in parkland or heath (whence the
pioneer habit).  Chestnut coppice?
Generation [SYMBOL]. Some of the older
deciduous (and possibly coniferous)
trees elsewhere, especially on
the N. of Great Wood.  Late 18th
cent.
Generation [SYMBOL].  Older conifers and
most of the middle-aged decidu-
ous 19th-cent., mainly replacing
earlier plantations.
Generation [SYMBOL] 20th-century,
mainly on formwer pasture or
parkland.
   The beeches have been rela-
tively unaffected by all these
changes; except that possibly 
there were isolated ones (as well
as the groups) which have 
perished.
2881
   The park in front of the 
Hall retains many old non-pol-
lard beeches and oaks.


   The other woods between
Holt and Cromer are mainly oak.
None appears to have a coppice
structure.
   Edgefield Heath is largely
overgrown with bushes.

Blickling Park.
   In the S.E. ccorner is a 
small group of ancient pollard
beeches similar to those at
Felbrigg in shape and size.  One 
has just been felled.

[12882-12883]
2882
   The woods in the Hevingham-
Stratton Strawless area are mainly
coniferized.
   There is still a tract of acid
heathland n the E. of the road
at Mansom Green, Stratton Straw--
less.

There appears to be no 
ancient grassland in the park at
Felbrigg, although the lawn to the 
W. of the house contains a
range pf bryophytes.

February 27.
  Tits have been investigating
the lamp-standard outside my 
rooms in which they have 
previously nested.

2884
February 28
Planted:  12 acorns from 
Felsham Hall Wood and 206
from Hayley, in 3 in" "whale-
hide" pots.
  All the FHW acorns were
stored dry and some have
germinated.
   About 3/4 of the Hayley acorns
are germinated, half with a
root 1/2"-4" long.  The ones
not germinated are the somewhat
drier ones at the top of the 
storage tub near its edges.  Roots
vary much in thickness and
condition.  Some have brown
or black lengths and occa-
sional mould. Nearly always 
some lateral roots when the
2885
main root is > 1 in. long.
In several cases the main
root has failed (in one or two
cases at < 1/2 in. from the
micropyle) and growth has
continued by one or more
laterals assuming dominance.
Two already-planted a-
corns were examined.  In both
the root tip was decayed but
the seed sound.
March 1.
    Fordham Hall Yard Wood
(making a path and bridges
round the E. side of the wood).
   This part of the wood is
very impassable with fallen 
trees, including very large wil-
lows and poplars.  Root mats

[12886-12887]
2886
are thin and upstanding.
   This part of the wood is
mainly alder, with some Salix
alba and ash.  Occasional
Populus canescens, including big
trees.  Hops abundant.
   Soil is deep peat, with
3 E.-W. ditches now about
2 ft deep.
   Trackways  of transverse
logs laid a year ago are now
covered with dead reeds  & and
difficult to find.  Many willow
logs have produced vertical
shoots.
   The entrance bridge was
repaired.
March 4.
   Heavy and continuous snow
2887
fell most of the day.  Despite
considerable melting, it lay 4 1/2in.
deep in the open by evening.
Driven by a N.E. wind and
thus lying on vetical gables,
chimneys, and trunks and bran-
ches of trees, but not much on
evergreen foliage.
March 3. [N.B.].
   Snowdrops and aconites are
flowering in Fanshawe grounds.
March 5.
Frost most of the day:  cold
front with no maore snow.  It
continued to lie except in direct
sun.  A thick verfirut and
shiny crust has formed.
March 6.

[12888-12889]
2888
  A slight thaw, but snow
persists in many places even
on buildings and trees.
  Weight of snow has broken
many of thw gorse bushes in
Leckhampton.
Mrch 7.
A little more snow fell
in the night.
March 8.
There has been no
more felling at Bourne Wood.

      Hayley Wood.
    An oak by the Main Ride
has had small areas of
the outer bark scales scraped
off on one side for sm,e
15 ft up the trunk.
2889
   The deer fence is intact.
   About 15 deer including
a white one and a golden
brown one, were seen going
from the coppice plots into
North Section.  Observed and 
photographed from some
20 yards away.  Most of
them appeared very gray,
light underneath.  Snow
background. [SYMBOL] 5 -7.
   Mean depth of snow in
Cross-roads Glade about 7 in.
A little 
shrew was [DIAG]
seen scampering over the snow
in Pond Ride Glade.
   The pond is very full,
with about 1 in. thickness of soft

   Phlebia merismoides (West
Section) is now past maturity and
dull pink.
   Top of [!!!!fallen]felled oak (W.
Setion) 124 ± 5 years (+
allowance for growth to this

   Depth of snow in Great
Glade  = 7 in.
   Bluebells and mercury are
appearing under the snow.
   The ditch pond is now
full, overglowing round the S.
end of the dam.  Frozen about
1 in. thick.  Another 6 in. depth would
flood a sizeable area to the E., 
but not extend the pond much

herd movement since the first
snowfall unlikely to exceed 5
miles.
   Urine deep yellow or pink.
Rabbits.
   One seen in N. section.
   Tracks much less frequent

   Mr Knox has a large
dump of old tyres in the angle
between the railway and his
concrete road.  They cover
probably 1/4 acre c. 4 ft deep.
A smaller stack of tyres is

Drainage.
   All surface channels
are active, apparently
thro' the snow melting
from underneath.
   Water leaves the
Wood at the N.W.
corner.  The Ash Swamp
system is running.
The S.E. Ride ditches
empty into it.  There
is a sizeable flow in
the S. boundary ditch.
   Much of rhe N.
section is under ice.

   Snow appears to
be responsible for 
many hawthorns and

[12896-12897]
2896
hazel poles falling across
rides.
   Hayley Lane is     
not quite straight,   [DIAG]
having a curvature

   Snow 
covers all the fields (prob-
ably thinner than in the
glades).  Cleared from the
ponds, which are dry.  Little
drifting, except on the S.
side of the Wood where there
are small cornices.  The
2897
depth is slightly greater in
glades than in the Wood.
Frost probably all day, but
brilliant sunshine and little
wind.

March 9.
   Weather much as Mar. 8.
Snow disappearing gradually
in sun, especially under trees.
March 10.
   Another day od almost con-
tinuous frost.  Snow remains
almost continuous in the 
open, and is much hardened.
Bare ground frozen hard.
March 11.
   Thaw with fine rain for

Marasmius oreades (Dr. Bell).
March 12.
   The thaw continues.  By
evening, little snow remained
except in accumulations.
March 13.
   Continuing thaw.  No snow
left except in accumula-
tions and very sheltered
places.
   The large Formes ulmarius
by the Hockey Ground road
is still active, though it has
not increased much recently.
[!!!!and] It still has a salmon
2899
pink P.S. This sporophore has
been observed for 11 years
(p. 2510) and is probably 18

Floods.
   Higher than I have seen
before in Cambridge.  They 
rose rather fast from about
midday on Mar. 12, before 
which the river had been 
clear and relatively low.
   Between Fen Causeway

2904
small overflow, by Newnham 
Mill:  most of the flood water
is coming down from above 
Fen Causeway or up from
Newnham Mill pool.  Slowly
flowing.  Several paths covered,
seldom more thsn 4 in. deep.
Bridge A on Coe Fen, how-
ever, is surrounded by some
8 in. of water and immedi-
ately in front of it the depth
exceeded 1 ft 3 in.
   Anchor Quay at least
1 ft deep.
   Between Fen Causeway 
and Newnham Croft, there are
several overflows, one about
50 yards long.  Much of the 
fen is under shallow fast
2905
water.  Depth on paths up to
4 in.
   The meadows above this
towards Paradise are all
flooded:  not the old hockey
ground, the ground next to it,
nor most of the Lammas
land.
   The lamp-post field at
441569 is under at least
6 in.  The other lamp-post field,
440568, is somewhat more
shallowly flooded.
   Towards Grantchester the
river is 250 yards wide.  The
floods extend nearly to the
footpath on the W. and to the
fen boundary ditch on the E.
The river banks have quite

[12906-12907]
disappeared and some of the
pollards are low in the water.
   The river flows at about
3 m.p.h.  It bears much wood
and branches of trees.
   In area and depth this
slightly exceeds the floods of
March 1969.  Water a rich brown
colour, not yellowish.
   Ducks and swans profit
by the increased water and
swim over what was dry land.

   The river has subsided
very fast.  All the fen is

Cut near ground level.
   Surrounding wood mainly 
birch.  One big ash stool
very near the lime.  No bracken.
   The lime has been 
overtopped by the surrounding
coppice, and needs to be
freed by slight cleaning if it
is to flourish.  This applies espe-
cially to the young stools.

This increase cannot be 
due to surface flow (on the
S. side the ground falls 
away, and on the N. there is
the wood-bank).  There must
be small springs under the
wood-bank.  The S. ditch
of Hewitt's meadow has little

  By the junction of Hewitt's

  The S. ditch is very deep,
the others shallower but
mostly wet.
  Outflow channel with
numerous wet hollows.
  Earth from ditch is
mainly spread out, only 
slight banks.
  Woodland within ditch
is almost entirely Betula
pubesacens.  Some coppicing
but mostly maidens.  Many
stumps up to c. 2 ft,
mostly apparently conifers
but some oak.  Big stumps
on side of ditch.

prodigious quantities.

  Alytrichum is very
abundant on stumps and 
fallen logs probably of co-
nifers. Occurs in large hum-
mocks.

Lime.
  Just outside the ditch
on the S. side.  Four stools.
Stool at ground level like
hazel, c. 1 /2 ft dia.  This
lime looks like that in Strawberry
Bank, grows markedly slower
than the other coppice and
is in danger of suppression.

Primula elatior:  a few

infls visible, but no open
flowers.

  About another 1/2 acre has
been coppiced.
  Poles cut nearby (in Fish-
pond Fell) for the Fishpool
bridge show 16 annual rings.
  Callitriche is visible in
Main Ride.

Plagiothecium {SYMBOL] 12.
  From a rotten stump just
outside the E. ditch of the
plantation moat.
[!!!!HLCW] says:  "It looks to me
like Plagiothecium currifolium
- v. narrow cells.  See Nyholm's
Flora. part 5".

A large village on a steep
hog's back ridge, coinciding
with the street AA.  there is
a steep slope down to the 
back street BB; the slope

[12930-12931]

is divided up by lanes and
is covered with od gardens.
The oldest houses (probably 
17th cent.) are mostly in the
back stret.  Behind them,
hedged strips run out to the
edge of the fen.
  The Culleys live in a 
new house on the N. slope of
the hill.  The roadside
ditch appears to be the
natural course of a steam.
The field C contains some
deep ditches (probably not
a moat) and some old
pollard elms.
 Sutton is remarkably tree-
less save for these at the
E. end and some moribund
2931
poplars.
  Haddenham hill similrly
has many hedged grass
fields.
