 Beech pollards mostly this
 size, some smaller.  In small
 groups, possibly in lines, in the
 bottom of the dry valley and in
 side-valleys and on the
 plateau to the E.
   Group A of the beeches is
 scattered among sycamore & coni-
 fers.  Little ground vegetation.
 

[12870-12871]
Chestnut coppice unevenaged,
some very old trees.
Some maiden std chestnuts to

Stool 87x23
  Vegetation between the Lion's
Mouth road and Group B of
the beeches.  Steep hillsides
above lat eral dry valleys.  Very
acid with sparse brambles and
bracken.  Chestnut coppice
very patchy.
  Alongside the Lion's Mouth
road are wood-bank-like banks
about 1 1/2 ft high, acute, very
overgrown with bryophytes, with
trees on them.
2871
Oak-Castanea wood
Nettles c. 2 1/2ft (4 ft in places).

Scattered groups of ancient
pioneer or pollard beech
Castanea, scattered old trees,
few younger.
Most oaks younger.
Few sycamore & Abies &
pine, prob c. 100 yrs old.
Beech gir 150" (some larger).
  Group B of the beeches
is in an old mixed wood.
Apart from the pollard beeches
([SYMBOL] 37) which resemble those of
Group A, the oldest trees are
probably the scattered oaks & 
chestnuts & perhaps the 
standard beech of pioneer form.


[12872-12873]
2872
[!!!!Beeches of !!!!] Undergrowth mostly of the
acid type, very sparse, with
some nettles in places.
   The N. side of Felbrigg
Great Wood (along the A148) has 
been encroached upon by recent
road-widening but appears not
to have had a wood-bank.
Much sycamore and conifers.
Maiden oak and beech of c.
100 years old or less,  No pol-
lards seen.
  The woods N. of the A148
are similar, with many exotics
and no old trees.

        Group C, [SYMBOL] 1-4
Beech beyond end of Victory
Trees c. 3 ft dia., ?evenaged
Pollarded probably once c.
6 ft high.
Ground vegetation sparse bramble
& bracken.
large patches of polyr fom &
Mnium horn.

Beech with 170 rings at least
   One of the smaller pollard 
beeches, possibly the same age as
the rest.  Two large branches fell
off about a year ago and
have been sawn up.  Annual
rings very distinct but micro-
scopic:  c. 170 counted in the field
whence the true number (to the
last pollarding) will probably turn
        
[12874-12875]
2874
out at least 200.
   These beeches are probably
some 80 ft high.  No other trees
among them.  No regeneration.
Few beeches younger than
this.  They are at present almost
intact. though a few have large
brackets of Ganoderme applan-
atum at the base.
   Soil apparently all gravel.
Slight mor accumulation.  No
shrubs.
   The edges of this grove are
rather diffuse.  Other great
pollard beeches occur between
this wood and the park in
front of the house.  Some of
these are larger, perhaps
oftener pollarded, and with
2875
well-cut "Trajan's Column" letters
presumably of great age, visible
on the trunks.  Group D.
   Lichens rather sparse and
inconspicuous.

  Between the house and
Group C is a complex series
of woodlands.  Some Castanea
coppice in an overgrown pole
stage among huge non-pollard
pioneer oaks and beeches:
presumably an 18th-cent.
planting in a deer park.
Many very large Castanea
standards.  In addition there 
are numerous plantings of
Ketton-Cremer's time, of a[!!!!]
variety of species. The

2877
   Victory Plantation was
intended in the shape of a 
V converging on a great
oak, but the latter has col-
lapsed.
  Group C is the largest
beech grove, an island in
other woodland.  Surroundings
mainly standard oak, a 
few of which are mixed
with the beeches.
  Group D are beeches
scattered among other mainly
much younger, trees.

Each group of pollard
beeches occurs on its own,
surrounded by other trees
all of which are clearly later.

[12878-12879]
2878
The beeches form closed com-
munities with little penetration
of other species and no under-
storey.  B and C are on the
flat gravel plateau, A in a
dry valley, D on steep slopes;
all very acid.
   The age of Group A, from
the rate of stretching, appears
to be at least 300 years.
This is consistent with last
pollarding c. 1770 (Group C).
   According to Ketton-Cremer's
Felbrigg, there was a deer park
and mature timber in quantity
on the estate in W. Windham
I's time (1675).  The wood was
apparently enlarged by plan-
ting by him and his suc-
2879
cessors, especially on the N. in
the late 18th cent. It is possible
that Windham planted the pol-
lard beeches;  but it is unlikely
that pollarding was started c.
1700 or that it would have
been applied to the beeches only.
A more probable sequence is:
Generation [SYMBOL]. 17th cent. or ear-
lier.  Present pollard beeches,
which then existed in at least
four groves, at least some of them
in open heathland.  (Group D is
on or near the site of "Old Wood",
1838 O.S.).
Generation [SYMBOL] The oldest sweet
chestnuts, oaks and perhaps non-
pollard beeches.  Those around
Group C, and perhaps Group B,
planted probably by W.W.I c. 1680

[12880-12881]
2880
in parkland or heath (whence the
pioneer habit).  Chestnut coppice?
Generation [SYMBOL]. Some of the older
deciduous (and possibly coniferous)
trees elsewhere, especially on
the N. of Great Wood.  Late 18th
cent.
Generation [SYMBOL].  Older conifers and
most of the middle-aged decidu-
ous 19th-cent., mainly replacing
earlier plantations.
Generation [SYMBOL] 20th-century,
mainly on formwer pasture or
parkland.
   The beeches have been rela-
tively unaffected by all these
changes; except that possibly 
there were isolated ones (as well
as the groups) which have 
perished.
2881
   The park in front of the 
Hall retains many old non-pol-
lard beeches and oaks.


   The other woods between
Holt and Cromer are mainly oak.
None appears to have a coppice
structure.
   Edgefield Heath is largely
overgrown with bushes.

Blickling Park.
   In the S.E. ccorner is a 
small group of ancient pollard
beeches similar to those at
Felbrigg in shape and size.  One 
has just been felled.

[12882-12883]
2882
   The woods in the Hevingham-
Stratton Strawless area are mainly
coniferized.
   There is still a tract of acid
heathland n the E. of the road
at Mansom Green, Stratton Straw--
less.

There appears to be no 
ancient grassland in the park at
Felbrigg, although the lawn to the 
W. of the house contains a
range pf bryophytes.

February 27.
  Tits have been investigating
the lamp-standard outside my 
rooms in which they have 
previously nested.
