[16810-16811]
Queest Moor Wood in Eardisley
largely felled
Lyonshall Park Wood
S.W. corner visited along lane,
which is a hollow-way.
Trees 95% oak, "high forest",
both spp, predominantly sessile,
a few of coppice origin. Very
variable, but mostly drawn up
tall by the closed canopy.
Few tall cherries (as high
as the oak, c. 60ft), some
ash & Sorbus aucup.
Underwood thin, irregular,
not regularly coppiced, Hazel
mainly; some holly.
Ground vegetation dominated
by mercury and bracken.
Foxglove
Wood-sage
Luzula multifl.
L. sylvat.
Oxalis
Topography rather uneven
with slopes & steep hollows.
Some patchy planting over the
last C.10 years of larch, sweet
chestnut &c
Some old exotics: beech
Castanea, [????], scattered about
the old wood.
Felling of a small patch
going on. Single oaks being
cut and made into cleft
fence stakes. About 4ft long,
each about 1/8 of a log, pointed
with a circular saw. Smaller
stakes made from branches

[16812-16813]
which are relatively straight.
The country between Lyonshall,
Weobley, and Hay-on-Wye is
full of mixed hedges, but hedge-
row trees are rather few and pollards almost non-existant.
14 August
LYONSHALL CASTLE
Two outer baileys defined
by ditches. THe larger one, and
the inner bailey, is wooded.
Oak trees, few elms, cherries,
beeches, little u/w; probably
fairly modern but has quiet
a good complement of woodland
plants. See record card.
Inner bailey has massive 
stone wall standing up to c.12ft
[DIAG]
high in places, needing repair.
Broad moat with bridge.
[16814-16815]
Lyonshall Park Wood
Betonica 2-3 plants
right at entrance to wood
Oak trunks heavily lichenized
Eve[????}, Pa[????]. &c
Cantharellus
[????]ndle-like holloway
c.12ft deep 255[SYMBOL]
Ash on bank 66y, (just
felled) ring 41 back[????]
17 1/2" [SYMBOL]
Betony freq. on roadside banks
No maple - tho' frequent in 
hedges nearby
Probably an ancient wood.
Rather poor in tree species by
E.Anglian standards; oak is
dominant to a greater extent
than in almost and E.Anglian
wood. Oak appears not to be
planted, but there is no trace of oak coppice.
Ground vegetation quite rich
and varied. Complete range
from mercury to Deschampsia
flexuosa and Vaccinium.
THe Arrow is a surprisingly
polluted mountain stream.
Nothing was seen of Offa's
Dyke in the W.part of the wood,
though a woodbank-like earth-
work in the middle of the wood
is roughly on the line.
