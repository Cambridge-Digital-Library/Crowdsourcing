13 AUGUST 1974
Holme Marsh few elms (except
in hedges), no DED

small grove)
Weobley: c80%
C[????]oop: c50%, some recent killing
Clyro c.30%+ some slight

[16810-16811]
Queest Moor Wood in Eardisley
largely felled
Lyonshall Park Wood
S.W. corner visited along lane,
which is a hollow-way.
Trees 95% oak, "high forest",
both spp, predominantly sessile,
a few of coppice origin. Very
variable, but mostly drawn up
tall by the closed canopy.
Few tall cherries (as high
as the oak, c. 60ft), some
ash & Sorbus aucup.
Underwood thin, irregular,
not regularly coppiced, Hazel
mainly; some holly.
Ground vegetation dominated
by mercury and bracken.
Foxglove
Wood-sage
Luzula multifl.
L. sylvat.
Oxalis
Topography rather uneven
with slopes & steep hollows.
Some patchy planting over the
last C.10 years of larch, sweet
chestnut &c
Some old exotics: beech
Castanea, [????], scattered about
the old wood.
Felling of a small patch
going on. Single oaks being
cut and made into cleft
fence stakes. About 4ft long,
each about 1/8 of a log, pointed
with a circular saw. Smaller
stakes made from branches

[16812-16813]
which are relatively straight.
The country between Lyonshall,
Weobley, and Hay-on-Wye is
full of mixed hedges, but hedge-
row trees are rather few and pollards almost non-existant.
14 August
LYONSHALL CASTLE
Two outer baileys defined
by ditches. THe larger one, and
the inner bailey, is wooded.
Oak trees, few elms, cherries,
beeches, little u/w; probably
fairly modern but has quiet
a good complement of woodland
plants. See record card.
Inner bailey has massive 
stone wall standing up to c.12ft
[DIAG]
high in places, needing repair.
Broad moat with bridge.
[16814-16815]
Lyonshall Park Wood
Betonica 2-3 plants
right at entrance to wood
Oak trunks heavily lichenized
Eve[????}, Pa[????]. &c
Cantharellus
[????]ndle-like holloway
c.12ft deep 255[SYMBOL]
Ash on bank 66y, (just
felled) ring 41 back[????]
17 1/2" [SYMBOL]
Betony freq. on roadside banks
No maple - tho' frequent in 
hedges nearby
Probably an ancient wood.
Rather poor in tree species by
E.Anglian standards; oak is
dominant to a greater extent
than in almost and E.Anglian
wood. Oak appears not to be
planted, but there is no trace of oak coppice.
Ground vegetation quite rich
and varied. Complete range
from mercury to Deschampsia
flexuosa and Vaccinium.
THe Arrow is a surprisingly
polluted mountain stream.
Nothing was seen of Offa's
Dyke in the W.part of the wood,
though a woodbank-like earth-
work in the middle of the wood
is roughly on the line.
[16816-16817]
Yaidon Coppice S.W of Lyonshall Park Wood
Wood-hedge.
Stds oak, few big Ug
Underwood mixed: hazel, [????]
ash.
Much bracken.
The Arrow plain around Court
of Noke is a curiously featureless
(and with many hedges but few
trees.
Shobdon. Little remains of the park
save the avenue of great oaks
from the church to the Arches.
Probably date from before the Arches.
Very tall though free-standing.
Wood to the N. of the Arches
(404633) is coniferized.
Court of Noke (Pembridge) 50
Oaker Wood (Lucton & Kingsland)
exists; it is a "high forest"
of oaks of c 1 1/2ft dia. closed
canopy, little underwood. Small
patch poplarized
Mortimer's Cross is is an abrupt
gorge with rock outcrops.
Croft Castle has some giant
ancient sweet-chestnuts.
The woods above Croft, towards
Croft Ambrey, are mostly conifer-
ized
15 August
Pembridge Belfry. Two of the 
great 13th-cent. corner posts appear
to have been rotten while
[16818-16819]
growing: one has a cavity. some
3ft above the base, into whic
one's hand can be inserted.
Most of the groves between
Eardisland and Bainstree Cross are
extant. No particular evidence
of coppice structure. Their names,
after a map seen in Burton
Court, are:

[TABLE]
Extensive and well run or-
chards form much of the estate 
at Burton Court
26'4 GBH Castanea by park
gate, Burton Court, Eardisland
424571. Has a broad elephant's
foot base (not included in the
girth) from which arise many
stout pole-sized (c.4" dia)
epicormics. Smaller epicormics
from bosses on the trunk. Tree
is about 60ft high, crown
relatively narrow apart from
one huge branch, free standing.
Has had a stage-head episode
(crown reduced x c.2/3). One
nearly as large stands close by.
Also in Burton Court park
is a Turkey-oak c4 1/2 ft thick.
Trunk short, breaking up into
branches from c6ft hight.
Tree rather spreading for Q.
[16820-16821]
Dilwyn c.40% of elms [????] - dead
cerris, c60ft high.
In the old park around
425575 are a few huge
spreading free-standing maiden
oaks, c.5ft dia., mostly
recovered from stag-head.
Pollards. A few big oaks in
fields & hedges around Sarns-
field. Pollards otherwise are very
rare in the district.
Eardisley Domesday Oak
Hurstway Common, 300496 on
a tiny grassy triangle or green
surrounded by houses.
The [!!!!] girth measure-
ment of 30ft (Eardisley guide)
is plausible; Massingham says
it is 45ft, less likely, he says
12 people can stand in the
hollow inside, and tentatively
equates it with "Loudon's Oak".
Appears to be robur (*)
Certainly non-woodland,
doubtfully pollard; several
big limbs, and remains of others,
spring from c.10ft up, but
it has a definite leading stem
above this point.
Some limbs have fallen
and the remaining ones were
lopped many years ago; but
the crown seems to have been
large though not enormous for
an oak. Branches have
decayed and most must now
be hollow themselves, but the
[16822-16823]
tree leafs vigorously without
dieback. No ties or cables.
Green plant used after lopping.
Eardisland Yew
A big yew in the church-
yard, c. 4ft dia., the largest
of many big yews in the 
churchyards round here.
A nest of wild bees has
been exposed by the recent
splitting off of an upper branch.
Several combs seen
hanging stalactite-
-like in a cavity.
Much bee activity
of the normal
kind.

Oaks have a remarkable vari-

all over much of the trunk. One 
ancient tree is reduced to the shell
