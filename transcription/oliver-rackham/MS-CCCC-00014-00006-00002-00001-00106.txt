Hayley Wood cont.
No pure Salix repens was
found by the railway, though
several bushes with some
of its characters exist.
Two of the telephone
poles along the line have
woodpecker holes.
Campanula glomerata is
at the height of its flowering.
The number of flowering
stems is of the order of 200,
with [!!!!] 10 very pale blue
ones.
1. Lactarius subdulcis.
A few under oaks &c. in
Hayley Lane next the
Triangle.

[8230-8231]

hazel at the S. corner of
the Triangle, and near

August 11.
Cavenham & Risby (to study
crops on patterned ground, with
Drs Coombe, Evans, and Watt).
Crops on patterned ground
show extremely pronounced
8241
[DIAG]
markings in the area of the
Black Ditch. The figure shows
the directions of the stripes
where visible, but not their
number. The soil consists
of alternate strips of chalky
[8242-8243]
8242

till with a considerable
clay fraction, [!!!!]interspered[!!!!] alternating
with deep sand.
1. Wheat. Crop taller and
more healthy on chalk. In
sand, equally ripe but
gray (owing to heavy Clado-
sporium) and slightly shorter.
2. Barley. Much as 5.
Stripes come right up to
the Black Ditch, showing that
this can never have had
a fosse on the W. side.
3. Sainfoin & clover. No obvious
stripes.
4. Barley. In this case, the
crop has ripened about
uniformly, but in one set
of stripes the straws show
a strong tendency to snap
8243

off about halfway up. Prob-
ably Maris Badger.
5. Barley. Field from which
Dr Coombe's samples came.
On the chalk, a normal
crop has resulted and is
now ripe. On the sand,
the crop was largely a
failure and the plants are
still growing and producing
tillers which by now are
at various stages up to
shortly after anthesis. The
sand stripes (green crop)
fan out towards the Black
Ditch, suggesting that here
there was a slight fosse
which has become drifted
up. This is almost certainly
a water effect since the
[8244-8245]
8244

whole field has been ploughed
for several years and was
recently manured. Proctor.
6. Ley. Stripes do not
show.
7. Lucerne. Stripes faint.
8. Barley. Much as 5.
9. Barley. Probably much as
5.
Onopordon grows abun-
dantly along the Black Ditch
by field 4.
Apera interrupta is
frequently along the Black
Ditch and along the drift
by fields 6, 7, and 8.
A. Spica-venti grows abun-
dantly in field 8.
There are many heaps
8245

of sewage sludge along
the edges of fields 7 and
8. One is producing a
very dense stand of some
Chenopodiaceae.  Another has
large brilliant orange and
crimson-pink patches, due
probably to the Corpus
Christi bacterium.

August 12.
The Leckhampton horse-
chestnuts affected by wilt
disease have continued to
decline slowly despite the
wet weather.
August 13.
Chrysanthemum segetum
transplanted early to the
garden at Norwich continues
[8246-8247]
8246

to make a big bushy plant
with many flowers. A plant
transplanted late from the
cornfield has not branched
any more in several weeks.

Nickey is not very active.
Bracken is flourishing,
and has now moved so as
to be mainly under the two
conifers in the front.
August 15.
Ipomoea opened its first
flower in the morning,
closing around noon.
August 16.
The first female gourd
flower opened and was
pollinated by hand.
August 17.
At Great Yeldham, N.W.
Essex, is a mighty village
oak with an immense trunk.
The tree appears to be
dead, and has been surroun-
ded at the base by a pebble
[8248-8249]
8248

wall to prevent decay,
while the trunk is surrounded
by iron bands and the
branches held together with
tie-rods.
Agaricus xanthodermus
grows abundantly among
bushes at the S. side of
the College playing field and
the adjacent part of Leck-
hampton. The McBurneys
have eaten it on several oc-
casions without ill effects.
August 18.
This day and the two
previous have been cloudless
and very hot.

A small sporophore of Fistu-
lina was seen emerging from
an oak.

Mr Caedel drew attention
to the following disease of
street Japanese-cherry trees
in Porson Road, Trumpington.
Leaves become dark brown
in well-defined sharp-edged
areas along the margins and
up the veins. This happens
all over one side of the
tree (N. or W. in different trees)
but depends on the position
of the leaf in the crown
rather than its attachment
to a particular branch,
adjacent leaves being equally
affected whether or not they
[8250-8251]
8250

are on the same branch.
Severely affected leaves fall
off, though defoliation is
not severe. Only four trees
in the double avenue are
affected; these are widely
scattered with healthy trees
between. The trees vary
much in size; some are
about 15 years old, though
some of the smaller ones
are replacments. Three of
the affected trees appear to
belong to the first generation.
Heat damage, frost, and
fumes were considered as
possible causes. Site is river
gravel.
August 20.
Madingley & Hayley Woods
(hemispherical photography)
Armillaria occurs in
several places in Madingley.
Tufts are small and their
development has probably
been arrested by drought.
Collybia radicata was
seen several times in Mad-
ingley.
August 21.
Hayley Wood (building hut).
Two tufts of Armillaria
were seen - condition
much as in Madingley.
Callitriche is very abun-
dant on soft mud in the
N.E. main ride.
August 22.
The hot weather ended
in heavy rain yesterday.
[8252-8253]

Ipomoea is very variable
in the time of opening
its flowers. They open soon
after dawn and shut any
time between noon and 6
p.m.
August 23.
The Passiflorae from Cam-
bridge market continue to
grow very fast, but show
no sign of flowering.
August 24.
Ipomoea flowers opened
from about 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
8253

About half of them
are 4 - merous and
half 5 - merous.
August 25.
The Sedum angli-
cum, having filled up
its pot, was transferred to
a small half-pot.
Two of the Sempervira not
repotted last time were done.
August 26.
The Ipomoea shows
no sign setting any seed.
August 27.
About half the corn
harvest has been got in.

Baeomyces rufus is very
abundant on the damp
earth of the cut-away
upper bank of the mountain
roads above Rinn. It grows
usually on nearly vertical
slopes (steeper and firmer than
Polytrichum areas).

1. Clavaria cinerea. Occasional
in the woods below Rinner A.

Snow recently fell in quan-
tity on the mountain, and
small packets remain down to
c. 1900 m.

2. At about 1450 m, above
Rinner Alpe, Amanita mus-
cana is frequent with
Zirm, larch, and spruce,
but no birch. Also Vaccin.

Evernia prun.

A very rare lichen. In all
the Zirm woods it was found
only twice, each time on
bare wood, once on a fallen
tree & once on a standing
trunk. Many other habitats
were available, including
larch.
