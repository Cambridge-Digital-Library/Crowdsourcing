23 July 66
Winterton Dunes cont
The "slacks" so-called
behind the dunes, seem
to be really blow-outs
in a wide and rather
uniform sand plateau
which forms the dune
range.  Many of them 
have floors of shingle.  There
is no trace of lateral
dune systems.
July 24
Very heavy rain fell from
around mid-day to 6 p.m.
At around 6, the great
beech in the garden of
Fanshawe House split.
A branch some 60 ft long,
about a third of the tree,
fell to the westward with

Occurs in small quantities
in some of ther lows (Abun-
dant in a limited area of
the fen woods and scrub
about 300 yds N. of the

a  noise like thunder, dama-
ging some fruit trees in
its fsll. The cause was a
narrow crotch with an included
pocket of bark extending
down nearly 2 ft into the 
trunk.  A root grew into
the pocket. The final collapse
was apparently produced by
the weight of rain on the
leaves, the slight breeze
which shook the trees earlier
in the rain-storm having
died down.

and the Part II class)
Severe damage has been
done by frost to bracken on
