23 July 66
Winterton Dunes cont
The "slacks" so-called
behind the dunes, seem
to be really blow-outs
in a wide and rather
uniform sand plateau
which forms the dune
range.  Many of them 
have floors of shingle.  There
is no trace of lateral
dune systems.
July 24
Very heavy rain fell from
around mid-day to 6 p.m.
At around 6, the great
beech in the garden of
Fanshawe House split.
A branch some 60 ft long,
about a third of the tree,
fell to the westward with

[8198-8199]
Bryophytes &c (23/7/66)
303. Sphagnum cf. fimbriatum.
Occurs in small quantities
in some of ther lows (Abun-
dant in a limited area of
the fen woods and scrub
about 300 yds N. of the
village.  Here it fruits abun-
dantly.)
304 (Winterton 25/7/66)Cladonia
gracilis, with narrow cups proli-
ferating marginally and
coarsely [????] pod.  Pd+r, K-.
305. Perhaps a chemical segre-
gate cf Cladonia subsquamosa.
Resembles 297 (p.8195), but has
curious scy. very widely trum-
pet-shaped, with squamules all
over, and big stsalked brown aps.
Recalls Cl. casptica Pd+ r, K-.

a  noise like thunder, dama-
ging some fruit trees in
its fsll. The cause was a
narrow crotch with an included
pocket of bark extending
down nearly 2 ft into the 
trunk.  A root grew into
the pocket. The final collapse
was apparently produced by
the weight of rain on the
leaves, the slight breeze
which shook the trees earlier
in the rain-storm having
died down.
July 25
Winterton & Hemsby (Peter Grubb
and the Part II class)
Severe damage has been
done by frost to bracken on
Bridgeham Heath,  Only that

[8200-8201]
on the highest ridges has escaped.
1. Paxillus involutus.  One on gray
dunes at Winterton
Ammecalamagosti is very
local at winterton.  A big
tussock was partly excavated
n the highest ridges has escaped.
1.  Paxillus involutus One on gray
dunes at Winbterton.
Ammecalamagotis is very
local at Winterton.  A big
tussock was partly excavated.
It is rather densely tufted,
with short rhizomes.  The
rate of upward growth appears
to be rather less than for
Ammophila so that it requires
a lesser rate of accretion of
sand.  The leaves are less
rigid than those of Ammo-
phila.  The plant is vege-
tatively considerably more
vigorous.  the rhizome apices
are massive and have a
characteristic rather unpleasant
taste.
Rumex temixfolius is abun-
dant on gray dunes.  It
spreads from creeping roots
which produce suckers.
Sphagnum occurs in small
quantities in some of the lows.
It fruits freely.  Apparently the
same species as in the carr.
July 26
The remainder of the 
Fanshawe beech has a similar
narrow crotch some 20 ft up,
with a pocket of bark exten-
ding at least 2 ft into the 
trunk.
July 27
A large Polyporus hispidus
[8202-8203]
Bryophytes & (25/7/66)
306. Sphagnum, fruiting in a
low at Winterton
307. Gymnocolea? ibid
308. Cladonia [!!!!]subsquamosa?[!!!!]furcata
Resembles 305 in its colour
and shape of squamules and
in its reactions but has
untidy monopodial podetia
with short sde-branches
bearing apo.,also small
scy.  This lichen occurs
with 304, 305, and many
others in gray dunes about
100 yds S. of the rugged massif
which is the highest point
of the dunes.
309. Bryum pendulum:  gray
dunes among grass.  Wire
Hills, Scolt (1.8.66)

grows on an old apple tree
in the Fellows' Garden, Corpus
Christi College, Oxford.
July 28[DIAG]
1. Ganoderma applana-
tum.  A sporophore, at least
six years old, on Quercus ilex.
White-Knight's Park, Reading
2.Marasmius androsacens.
 In grass, White-Knight's Park
 July 29 Windsor Hall
 White-Knight's Park
 Reading
 There are several ancient
 trees in White-Knight's
 Park.  Among them is a
 a short pollard-like oak near
 the lake, some 67 ft diam.
 Half the crown and trunk
 have split away and are
 lost.  The exposed surface
 is grsdually being overgrown
 [8204-8205]
 from the edges.  It is riddled
 with death-watch-beetle-like
 holes.
 At Shinfield, in the Insti-
 tute of Horticulture, seversal
 Ipomoes plants arw growing.
 They suffer the same symptoms
 as that in Leckhampton - namely
 Chlorosis (late development of
 chloroiophyll in young leaves)
 non-planar leaves (wrinkled
 and curly), and in extreme
 cases leaf browning.
July 30
\The fallen beech 
at Fanshawe has been taken 
away.  The wound on the
tree has been trimmed and
spread with a thick layer
of mastic composition on wire
netting.
July 31 [DIAG]
Thunder-flies were en-
countered in vast numbers
along the Coton footpath,
but are very local and few
have been seen in Leckhampton.
August 1
Scolt Head Island (Part II Class)
Severe frost damage to
bracken at Hollow Heath,
Hilboro.
Along Butcher's Beach
there is a very good zone of
Fucus spiralis and an 
upper one of Pelvetia.  Both
are rooted in shingle.  Pel-
vetia is attached to quite
small pebbles.
Butcher's Beach is being
[8206-8207]
slowly eroded by Norton
Creek.  This reveals that the
muds are strongly laminated,
with ferriginous plates.
No henbane was seen
on the Nod, but Atriplex littoralis
and A. hastata are very abundant.
Much of the drift litter con-
sists mainly of small crab shells.
Zostera nana and Z.
Hornemanniana are both
flourishing and flowering 
abundantly. Z. nana forms
a meadow in fine sand
on the E. side of Cockle
Bight.  Z. Hornemanniana 
was found in deep gooey mud
on the S. side of a deep
hole in Inner Cockle Bight.
[DIAG]
[8208-8209]
Small winkle-like animals
about 1/8 in long occur in
vast numbers in the Zostera
nana meadow.
Many small jelly-fish
were seen stranded and dried up
in Cockle Bight.
Lichen Heath
Occurs in considerable
quantity on Wire Hills and 
to some extent on Privet
Hill and House Hills, but
does not form such a
characteristic feature of the
gray dunes as it does 
at Winterton. Lichen stands
are rarely pure.  Branching
and scyphiferous species are
about equal in abundance.
Lichen species:
310 Cornicularia aculeate
311 Cladonia gracilis. Similar
to 304 at Winterton, but
more irregular.  Pd+r, K-,
312. Cl. rangiformis.  Often
dominant, mixed with the
following.  Whitish, [????]
sparingly dichotomizing. Axils
usually closed.  Pd-, K+y.
313. Cl. subrangiformis.  Solely
distinguishable from the
above by being Pd+r.  Usu-
ally browner.
314. Cl. inpexa.  A small form,
predominantly dichotomizing.
Pd-.
315. Cl. scabriuscula.  Much
branched, axils open, very
squamose-sorediose. Pd+r, K-.

[8210-8211]

316. House Hills.  Resembles
Cl. pyxidata but larger,
proliferating centrally or mar-
ginally farinous;y soreditse.
Cl. fimbriata.  K-, Pd+r.
317.  Cl. endiviaefolia. K-, Pd+r.
The pond on House
Hill is full.
Rosa rubiginosa occurs
in seversl places on House
Hills.
Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus
is abundant on House Hills.
Lactusa virosa is abundant
on Privet Hills.
Hawthorns are severely
browned on the seaward
side on House Hills, and 
at Burnham Norton on the
hill-top.
A few puff-ball bases
were found at House Hills.
1. Abundant in short grass
on House Hills and elsewhere.
1 1/8 - 2 - 3/16.
P. flattish.  Very hygro-
panous, when dry or damp
dirty cream-white, isabelline to
grayish-buff whwn soaked,
cracked, Â±matt, slightly viscid.
S. crooked, dirty cream-
-white,! shiny, damp, solid.
L. thin, distant, broad,
adnate, vandyke-chocolate
[8212 - 8213]
that it is due to excessive
radiation.  Not usually severe:
a strip about 1 - 2 mm
wide around the edge of the
leaf is often all that
is affected.
2.  leaf rot.  Usually
attacks a rhomboidal area
at the end of the leaf.
Often attacks [DIAG]
the shoulders 
of the leaf
and may
extend 
down
the 
petiole
in severe
cases: the
[8214 - 8215]
plant then snaps off at a
node.  It usually affects
plants which grow in
slight hollows and are
weak and chlorotic.  Fre-
quent and severe just
back of the boundary bank
along the W. side of the
wood forming a zone just
inward of the cone of
leaf necrosis on the bank
itself.  Not often found 
more than 50 yards into
the wood on the w. side
though it occurs wwll into
the wood elsewhere espe-
cially in the widened pond
ride.  Occurs locally in
the swamp area along the
s. side but is only seldom
severe.  The weather has been
very wet recently and a
Botrytis-like fungus was
seen on the dead tissue.
The cause may well be
a combination of waterlogged
roots (just inside the boun-
dary bank!) and humidity
and heavy rain.
A very similar disease
affects Circaea
Both diseases may affect
the same plant.
A single elm occurs
near the western margin.
Another oak log was found
[8216 - 8217]
cut and not carted in the
W. section C. 2 ft. diameter, c. 80
years.  Much Cladonia maci-
lenta.
One of the big pioneer-
like hawthorns near the
S.W. entrance has recently
fallen.
Several coppice oaks have 
been discovered in the W.
section (see map).
There is a patch of
birch and hawthorn scrub
near the S.W. entrance.
A small pit about 1 ft
deep, fairly recently dug,
was found near the S.W.
entrance.
1. Oudemansiella medicata
one by a dead maple, W.
section.
A rabbit was seen near
the S.W. entrance.
2. Several in teroops undeer
coppice, N.W. corner of wood.
P. slightly depressed,
rich chestnut, strongly zoned,
smooth, very matt, humid
S. cylindriuc, pale

August 4
After a long period of
little growth, the gourds have
rapidly come on (probably
because of heavy rain) and
have now started to flower.
August 5
Ipomea has produced
several flower-buds.

August 6
Duxford Roadside.
The verge on the N. side
of the A505 from the Whittes-
ford turn (466468) to the
point 470470 is a locality for
Muscaria.  It is becoming 
overgrown by blackthorn
and hawthorn from the
hedge.  This was cut today.
The verge was mown about
[8224 - 8225]
4-6 weeks ago.  Scabiosa colum-
baria is very abundant and
flowering well after the cutting.
Linum catharticum and
Pimpinella Saxifraga are abun-
dant on the verge.  Sainfoin
occurs.  Plantago media.
The dominant areas in
both the cut verge and the
uncut hedge-bank is Arrhena-
therium.
Centaurea Scabiosa occurs
mainly in the hedge-bank.
Orobanche elatior occurs
in the hedge-bank: about
20 plants, including 10 aroubd
one host.
Cystopus is very abundant 
on Capsella in a waste corner
of a field, 871871.
Silene noctiflora and
Fumaria parviflora occur ibid.
August 7
The clearing of the Ar-
millaria area at the Botanic
Gardens is now finished.
August 8
A flash storm with very 
heavy rain for a short time.
August 9
Very heavy and prolonged
rain.

Hayley Wood (annual peram-
bulation).
An oak seedling was
found in Hayley Lane.
Ulmus glabra is a main
constituent of the hedges on
[8226 - 8227]
both sides of Hayley Lane
before the railway.
U. carpinifolia also occurs.
Pimpinella major occurs in
Hayley Lane and tbe Melam-
pyrum hedge (see map).
Bromus erectus, Festuca
gigantea, and Brachypodium
sylvaticum are very flourishing
in Hayley Labe along with
Rumex sanguinens, Arctium,
and other woodland plants,
following the bush-clearance
in the lane earlier this
year.
4-5 plants of Danguisorba
officianalis were found near
the stile to the Melam-
pyrum hedge;  it also oc-
curs sparingly in the hedge 
itself.  [OGS]
Melampyrum isscattered 
along the Hedge.  Plants
about 18 in. high.
A few plants of Genista
tinctoria occur in the Hedge.
Kickxia spuria occurs in
the field S. of the Melampyrum
hedge.
Agropynum caninum
was found in the S.E.
ride (see map).
Three [!!!!Several!!!!] plants of Pimpin-
ella major were found here.
The water in th pond
is now nearly yp to the 
level of the ditch by the
end ride.
Five rabbits were seen on
Mr Cox's field near the N.W.
entrance.
[8228]
The following plants occur
on the railway line (see map);
Linum catharticum (G. Crompton)
Polytrichum juniperinum (on
ballast).
Carex flacca
Euphorbia nemorosa NGS
Valeriana officinalis (tetraploid,
S.M.W.)
Ononis spinosa
Trifolium major [!!!!](5th known
Hayley locality).
Potentilla ?erecta.  On the
edge of the verge, where it 
meets the ballast.  A very
puzzling plant with prostrate
stems and solitary partly
5 - merous large flowers, thus
perhapa P. anglica.
