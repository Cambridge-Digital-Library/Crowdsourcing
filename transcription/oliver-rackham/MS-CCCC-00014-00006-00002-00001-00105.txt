23 July 66
Winterton Dunes cont
The "slacks" so-called
behind the dunes, seem
to be really blow-outs
in a wide and rather
uniform sand plateau
which forms the dune
range.  Many of them 
have floors of shingle.  There
is no trace of lateral
dune systems.
July 24
Very heavy rain fell from
around mid-day to 6 p.m.
At around 6, the great
beech in the garden of
Fanshawe House split.
A branch some 60 ft long,
about a third of the tree,
fell to the westward with

[8198-8199]
Bryophytes &c (23/7/66)
303. Sphagnum cf. fimbriatum.
Occurs in small quantities
in some of ther lows (Abun-
dant in a limited area of
the fen woods and scrub
about 300 yds N. of the
village.  Here it fruits abun-
dantly.)
304 (Winterton 25/7/66)Cladonia
gracilis, with narrow cups proli-
ferating marginally and
coarsely [????] pod.  Pd+r, K-.
305. Perhaps a chemical segre-
gate cf Cladonia subsquamosa.
Resembles 297 (p.8195), but has
curious scy. very widely trum-
pet-shaped, with squamules all
over, and big stsalked brown aps.
Recalls Cl. casptica Pd+ r, K-.

a  noise like thunder, dama-
ging some fruit trees in
its fsll. The cause was a
narrow crotch with an included
pocket of bark extending
down nearly 2 ft into the 
trunk.  A root grew into
the pocket. The final collapse
was apparently produced by
the weight of rain on the
leaves, the slight breeze
which shook the trees earlier
in the rain-storm having
died down.
July 25
Winterton & Hemsby (Peter Grubb
and the Part II class)
Severe damage has been
done by frost to bracken on
Bridgeham Heath,  Only that

[8200-8201]
on the highest ridges has escaped.
1. Paxillus involutus.  One on gray
dunes at Winterton
Ammecalamagosti is very
local at winterton.  A big
tussock was partly excavated
n the highest ridges has escaped.
1.  Paxillus involutus One on gray
dunes at Winbterton.
Ammecalamagotis is very
local at Winterton.  A big
tussock was partly excavated.
It is rather densely tufted,
with short rhizomes.  The
rate of upward growth appears
to be rather less than for
Ammophila so that it requires
a lesser rate of accretion of
sand.  The leaves are less
rigid than those of Ammo-
phila.  The plant is vege-
tatively considerably more
vigorous.  the rhizome apices
are massive and have a
characteristic rather unpleasant
taste.
Rumex temixfolius is abun-
dant on gray dunes.  It
spreads from creeping roots
which produce suckers.
Sphagnum occurs in small
quantities in some of the lows.
It fruits freely.  Apparently the
same species as in the carr.
July 26
The remainder of the 
Fanshawe beech has a similar
narrow crotch some 20 ft up,
with a pocket of bark exten-
ding at least 2 ft into the 
trunk.
July 27
A large Polyporus hispidus
