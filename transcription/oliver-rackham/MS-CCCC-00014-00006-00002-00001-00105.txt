23 July 66
Winterton Dunes cont
The "slacks" so-called
behind the dunes, seem
to be really blow-outs
in a wide and rather
uniform sand plateau
which forms the dune
range.  Many of them 
have floors of shingle.  There
is no trace of lateral
dune systems.
July 24
Very heavy rain fell from
around mid-day to 6 p.m.
At around 6, the great
beech in the garden of
Fanshawe House split.
A branch some 60 ft long,
about a third of the tree,
fell to the westward with

[8198-8199]
Bryophytes &c (23/7/66)
303. Sphagnum cf. fimbriatum.
Occurs in small quantities
in some of ther lows (Abun-
dant in a limited area of
the fen woods and scrub
about 300 yds N. of the
village.  Here it fruits abun-
dantly.)
304 (Winterton 25/7/66)Cladonia
gracilis, with narrow cups proli-
ferating marginally and
coarsely [????] pod.  Pd+r, K-.
305. Perhaps a chemical segre-
gate cf Cladonia subsquamosa.
Resembles 297 (p.8195), but has
curious scy. very widely trum-
pet-shaped, with squamules all
over, and big stsalked brown aps.
Recalls Cl. casptica Pd+ r, K-.

a  noise like thunder, dama-
ging some fruit trees in
its fsll. The cause was a
narrow crotch with an included
pocket of bark extending
down nearly 2 ft into the 
trunk.  A root grew into
the pocket. The final collapse
was apparently produced by
the weight of rain on the
leaves, the slight breeze
which shook the trees earlier
in the rain-storm having
died down.
July 25
Winterton & Hemsby (Peter Grubb
and the Part II class)
Severe damage has been
done by frost to bracken on
Bridgeham Heath,  Only that

[8200-8201]
on the highest ridges has escaped.
1. Paxillus involutus.  One on gray
dunes at Winterton
Ammecalamagosti is very
local at winterton.  A big
tussock was partly excavated
n the highest ridges has escaped.
1.  Paxillus involutus One on gray
dunes at Winbterton.
Ammecalamagotis is very
local at Winterton.  A big
tussock was partly excavated.
It is rather densely tufted,
with short rhizomes.  The
rate of upward growth appears
to be rather less than for
Ammophila so that it requires
a lesser rate of accretion of
sand.  The leaves are less
rigid than those of Ammo-
phila.  The plant is vege-
tatively considerably more
vigorous.  the rhizome apices
are massive and have a
characteristic rather unpleasant
taste.
Rumex temixfolius is abun-
dant on gray dunes.  It
spreads from creeping roots
which produce suckers.
Sphagnum occurs in small
quantities in some of the lows.
It fruits freely.  Apparently the
same species as in the carr.
July 26
The remainder of the 
Fanshawe beech has a similar
narrow crotch some 20 ft up,
with a pocket of bark exten-
ding at least 2 ft into the 
trunk.
July 27
A large Polyporus hispidus
[8202-8203]
Bryophytes & (25/7/66)
306. Sphagnum, fruiting in a
low at Winterton
307. Gymnocolea? ibid
308. Cladonia [!!!!]subsquamosa?[!!!!]furcata
Resembles 305 in its colour
and shape of squamules and
in its reactions but has
untidy monopodial podetia
with short sde-branches
bearing apo.,also small
scy.  This lichen occurs
with 304, 305, and many
others in gray dunes about
100 yds S. of the rugged massif
which is the highest point
of the dunes.
309. Bryum pendulum:  gray
dunes among grass.  Wire
Hills, Scolt (1.8.66)

grows on an old apple tree
in the Fellows' Garden, Corpus
Christi College, Oxford.
July 28[DIAG]
1. Ganoderma applana-
tum.  A sporophore, at least
six years old, on Quercus ilex.
White-Knight's Park, Reading
2.Marasmius androsacens.
 In grass, White-Knight's Park
 July 29 Windsor Hall
 White-Knight's Park
 Reading
 There are several ancient
 trees in White-Knight's
 Park.  Among them is a
 a short pollard-like oak near
 the lake, some 67 ft diam.
 Half the crown and trunk
 have split away and are
 lost.  The exposed surface
 is grsdually being overgrown
 [8204-8205]
 from the edges.  It is riddled
 with death-watch-beetle-like
 holes.
 At Shinfield, in the Insti-
 tute of Horticulture, seversal
 Ipomoes plants arw growing.
 They suffer the same symptoms
 as that in Leckhampton - namely
 Chlorosis (late development of
 chloroiophyll in young leaves)
 non-planar leaves (wrinkled
 and curly), and in extreme
 cases leaf browning.
July 30
\The fallen beech 
at Fanshawe has been taken 
away.  The wound on the
tree has been trimmed and
spread with a thick layer
of mastic composition on wire
netting.
July 31 [DIAG]
Thunder-flies were en-
countered in vast numbers
along the Coton footpath,
but are very local and few
have been seen in Leckhampton.
August 1
Scolt Head Island (Part II Class)
Severe frost damage to
bracken at Hollow Heath,
Hilboro.
Along Butcher's Beach
there is a very good zone of
Fucus spiralis and an 
upper one of Pelvetia.  Both
are rooted in shingle.  Pel-
vetia is attached to quite
small pebbles.
Butcher's Beach is being
[8206-8207]
slowly eroded by Norton
Creek.  This reveals that the
muds are strongly laminated,
with ferriginous plates.
No henbane was seen
on the Nod, but Atriplex littoralis
and A. hastata are very abundant.
Much of the drift litter con-
sists mainly of small crab shells.
Zostera nana and Z.
Hornemanniana are both
flourishing and flowering 
abundantly. Z. nana forms
a meadow in fine sand
on the E. side of Cockle
Bight.  Z. Hornemanniana 
was found in deep gooey mud
on the S. side of a deep
hole in Inner Cockle Bight.
