Wicken Fen (Part II).
Oaks on Wicken Fen
 A seedling was found in the
permanent quadrat in the
Godwin Plot X (undisturbed) under
dense Frangula canopy. Dark
green leaves. 2 years old at
least, eaten off at least twice
but producing 2 leaves.
 Near the brick-pits is an
area of Frangula carr with oaks.
Oaks are c. 20ft high and
up to c. 8in diam. No large
branches below c. 10ft high.
These oaks are almost cer-
tainly contemporary with the
carr rather than a later stage
in the succession.
[11054-11055]
 Lysimachia vulgaris has
leaves in 3s on most fertile
stems, but in 2s on most
sterile stems. Occasionally in 4s
on fertile stems.
 Lythrum when vigorous has
leaves in 3s and an hexagonal
(instead of square) stem.
 Most of the recent colon-
ization of the Godwin plots
by [????] is pubescens.
 Peucedanum palustre
now rare in most of the open
areas.
 Glyceria pedicellata is
abundant on a short stretch of
much-trafficked drove by the Rham-
nus Triangle.
 Devil's coachmen are becoming
frequent.
 Utricularia is now abundant
in the E. boundary drain
near the entrance but has
almost vanished from the
brick pits.
 Cladium appears to have
declined in importance in
the fen as a whole.
 Carices are remarkably
few on the main drove, which
now consists of a strip of
Plantago major - Potentilla
anserina turf down the
middle, and bands of Juncus 
articulatus down the sides
separating this from the fen.
 The minor droves
usually have Juncus arti-
[11056-11057]
culatus but not the spp
of the very trodden central
strip.
 Lemna gibba is the 
commonest sp. in the E. boundary
ditch near the entrance. L.
minor & trisulca are less
abundant. Spirodela and Azol-
la have not been seen this
year.
 Sagittaria is frequent in
Drainer's Ditch.
