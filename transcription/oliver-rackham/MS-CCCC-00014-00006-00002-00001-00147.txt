July 22 [DIAG]
Wicken Fen (Part II).
Oaks on Wicken Fen
 A seedling was found in the
permanent quadrat in the
Godwin Plot X (undisturbed) under
dense Frangula canopy. Dark
green leaves. 2 years old at
least, eaten off at least twice
but producing 2 leaves.
 Near the brick-pits is an
area of Frangula carr with oaks.
Oaks are c. 20ft high and
up to c. 8in diam. No large
branches below c. 10ft high.
These oaks are almost cer-
tainly contemporary with the
carr rather than a later stage
in the succession.
[11054-11055]
 Lysimachia vulgaris has
leaves in 3s on most fertile
stems, but in 2s on most
sterile stems. Occasionally in 4s
on fertile stems.
 Lythrum when vigorous has
leaves in 3s and an hexagonal
(instead of square) stem.
 Most of the recent colon-
ization of the Godwin plots
by [????] is pubescens.
 Peucedanum palustre
now rare in most of the open
areas.
 Glyceria pedicellata is
abundant on a short stretch of
much-trafficked drove by the Rham-
nus Triangle.
 Devil's coachmen are becoming
frequent.
 Utricularia is now abundant
in the E. boundary drain
near the entrance but has
almost vanished from the
brick pits.
 Cladium appears to have
declined in importance in
the fen as a whole.
 Carices are remarkably
few on the main drove, which
now consists of a strip of
Plantago major - Potentilla
anserina turf down the
middle, and bands of Juncus 
articulatus down the sides
separating this from the fen.
  The minor droves
usually have Juncus arti-
[11056-11057]
culatus but not the spp
of the very trodden central
strip.
Lemna gibba is the 
commonest sp. in the E. boundary
ditch near the entrance. L.
minor & trisulca are less
abundant. Spirodela and Azol-
la have not been seen this
year.
 Sagittaria is frequent in
Drainer's Ditch.
 Thelypteris is a common
plant under carr.
 Galium palustre is on
the whole a plant of tall
fen with Phragmites, Phalaris,
&c. Mown Molinia fen has
G. uliginosum. Tall fen has
the most spp in common with
Hayley, e.g.
Galium palustre
Cirsium palustre
Lychnis flos-cuculi

 Many spp of Epilobium
occur in the fen, mainly in
areas disturbed by bush
clearing &c. Those seen in-
clude :
E. montanum
 parviflorum
 roseum
 adenocaulon x palustre
 The Triangle is said to
be a remnant of the Rhamnus
carr (sometimes regarded as
[11058-11059]
successional to Frangula)
which dominated wide areas
in the past but has now
been reduced partly by the
1950 fire and partly by
its greater ease of clearing.
 To the N. of the fen one
field separates it from [????].
 A fine dragon-fly was seen
at the N. end of Drainers'
Ditch.
 Ranunculus Lingua has
greatly increased but is still
in the same area, Φ. 16
 There is [!!!!]no sign of[!!!!] little gale
damage on the Fen or any-
where on the roads from Cam-
bridge via Stretham or the
Swaffhams.
July 25.
Sutton Bonington
Whitwell Wood, near Oakham,
Rutland. An oak-ash
wood with much sycamore &
some (apparently marginal)
elm. No coppice. The E.
end of the wood appears to
have disappeared, and the
roadside clearing is very
wide in most of its length
and not very convincing.
 No signs of gale damage
to trees outside Cambs, but
much corn is flattened.
 The Nuffield experiment this
year is on a field with
slight ridge & furrow in two
directions at right angles.

Elm collections
1. Top of young tree.
2. Side branch of young tree.
3. Side branches of 2 young
3'. trees in the E. spinney (by
railway).
[!!!!]4[!!!!]5' Side branch of small
tree under a canopy gap.
This elm differs from all the
others in having numerous fine
epicormic shoots, with large
petiolate leaves, all the way
up the trunk & larger bran-
[11062-11063]
ches.
4. Side branch of small tree.
5. Canopy specimen secured
from a fallen branch.
6. Mature tree at edge of wood.
7. Side branch of small tree.
8. Small tree at edge of wood.

Brambles.
1. Apparently frequent in
the wood. Stem and panicle
both slightly glandular, with-
out acicles. Petals pale pink,
crumpled, shortly clawed. Flowers
2½ cm diam., petals 11mm long.
Stamens lomger than styles,
fil. white, anthers glabrous.
Petals hairy.
  Rubus pyramidalis? agrees fairly
well, but stem leaves not
green-felted below.

2. Also frequent. Stem & panicles
with many glands & acicles.
Petals broad, pink, not crumpled,
not clawed. Flowers 18mm diam,
petals 10mm long. Stamens
white, glabrous anthers, much
longer than styles. Styles
greenish. Petals glabrous.
Rubus inopacatus.
 
Epilobium 1 is montanum. 

 Lathyrus latifolius. 2 plants
in railway verge.
 The N. railway track has
had a train on it recently.
[11064-11065]
 Juncus effusus is the
common sp. in the coppice area.
 There is remarkably little
gale damage. The largest
broken branch seen was of
an elm, c. 4 in. dia. (from
which came specimen 5). Fallen
twigs are frequent. Foliage
shredding is rare. The S.W.
corner was visited but no
more damage seen.
 The path along the S.
margin has been much used
recently. A test tube with a
rather complex set of substances
inside was found apparently
dropped.
1. Tremella mesenterica. A nearly
turgid specimen on ash in the
S. Section
 A single hind was found
lying in bushes in the S.W.
corner.
 Juncus. All three spp at
cross-roads. 
 Hypericum tetrapterum.
Cross-roads. 
 No visible differences inside
& outside the deer-fence
plot.
 The cutting of Middle Hayley
Lane has been postponed be-
cause Mr Cooper says he saw
nestling birds coming out into
the opening & an old crow
came down and swallowed
them one after the other.
 Mosquitoes are not bad.
[11066-11067]
[DIAG]
 Much deer activity in
the E. section.
 The tree-top hide is
now usable.
 The pond is exceptionally
high (above its usual maxi-
mum in winter). The black
holes do not contain any
water. The pool near the
middle of Hayley Lane has
some. There must have been
a substantial escape at the
S.W. corner.
 South Hayley Lane is very
overgrown with tall herbs and
coppicing bushes. 
 The Carex nearly on 3rd N. Ride
is not fruiting; the patch
under trees is very weak.
 July 28. see p. 1084.
[11068-11069]
July 29. Buff Wood.
1. In large numbers on
sticks (see map).
Crepidotus mollis.

2. Abundant in the S.E. half.
Coprinus disseminatus.

3. One in poor condition on
the main ride.
Probably Lacrimaria lacrimabun-
dum?

4. Two side by side under
poplars in the Lane 3-2¼-⅝.
 P. flat, bright cherry pink,
darker at margin but other-
wise uniform, no yellow
or green tinge, smooth, +
shiny, very humid & somewhat
viscid, peeling with some dif-
ficulty & leaving some of the
colour behind, edge slightly striate.
 S. cylindric but irregular,
white, smooth, matt, dry,
stuffed, light-weight.
 L. thin, crowded, equal,
broad, adnexed, connected
by veins at base, pale
[!!!!]lemon[!!!!] cream yellow, fragile.
 C. thin, white, reddish
under pellicle, chalky, fun-
gus smell, no taste.

Russula velenovskyi
det. 1981 with Rayner key.
[11070-11071]
[DIAG]
5. Several in groups on
elm logs in the S.W. field
(see map). 5-2½-¾. Two
or more sometimes joined
at the extreme base.
 P. an irregular inverted
cone, margin turned downwards,
deep buff with a smoky
tinge, + irregularly lobed,
uniform in colour, humid
but not viscous, matt.
 S. excentric, cylindrical,
deeply sulcate, cartilaginous,
very tough and rubbery,
solid, cream above, chocolate
brown below, blackish at
very base, smooth, matt,
humid.
 P.S. uniform, smooth,
cream, not sharply demarcated
from S. Pores remarkably
small (100μ dia.), and
short (c. 120μ long), spaced
at about 7 to the mm,
round.
 C. thin, whitish, rather
[11072-11073]
tough, polyporine smell.
[DIAG]

Polyporus varius [????]gg
H.J.H. is uncertain
which species.

 Oak and beech are now
almost the only species re-
cognizable in the litter.
 Euonymus is scattered
through the wood and frequent
in the area shown.
 Two plants of Ranunculus
sceleratus occur in the 1968
coppice, both on bonfire sites.

 Elm specimen: Side branch
of a small tree in the S. W. field.

 The nettles inside the S. W.
moat grew about 4ft high
this year but are now
completely laid like a field
of corn. They have shown no
tendency to get up again,
and many of the leaves are
rotten, but a second crop
[11074-11075]
is coming from erect axillary
branches. Galium aparine is
more flourishing than usual.
 Orchis mascula appears
to rot down with remarkable
speed as no sign of it could
be found in its known sites.
 There are about 4 plants
of Platanthera in the 1968
coppice. One produced an
abortive inflorescence.
 Most of the Epilobium in
the 1968 coppice is montanum.
Parviflorum and adenocaulon
occur but are mush rarer.
 Galeobdolon is [????] in
the 1968 coppice, mainly in
the poplar section.
 Veronica chamaedrys is
frequent in the 1968 coppice,
usually with a terminal leafy
gall replacing the inflorescence.
 V. serpyllifolia occurs on
the N.E.-S.W. ride.
 One primrose was
found in flower. Both spp
of violets are flowering
fairly frequently – all in
the coppice.

Coppice regeneration
 Hazel c. 15in. high from
all stools.
 Ash c. 2ft.
 Hornbeam c. 4in.
 Poplar – abundant suckers
of P. tremula; P. canadensis
forms a remarkable ring
[11076-11077]
[DIAG]
of brilliant red sucker shoots
from the cambium.
 Rides cut this year
were the N.E-S.W., and the
N.W.-S.E. as far as the
crossroads.
 Cirsium arvense is the
commonest thistle in the
coppice, almost certainly
from seed. Not associated
[11078-11079]
particularly with bonfires.

Carex in moat. Sterile and
indeterminate: along a stretch
of about 10 yards.
July 15 (from p.1002).
 Gale damage between
Harwich and Colchester has
been considerable. Many
trees (usually [!!!!]isolated[!!!!] in hedges) are
uprooted and lie towards the S.E. or E.S.E.
July 16 (from p.1002) [DIAG]
Gale damage in Cambridge.
 This is said to have
occurred between 5 & 6 a.m.
on July 11.
 Leckhampton: many branches
up to c. 6 in. dia. fallen from
Robinia trees in the loke;
no comparable damage to
any other trees but smaller
branches broken from Ailan-
thus &c.; foliage badly
[11080-11081]
shredded on horsechestnuts,
especially isolated trees, and
twigs broken.
 A few branches broken
on plane trees in Sidgwick
Avenue.
 Queens' Piece: many
branches up to c. 3in. diam.
broken from the crowns of
lime trees, some still lodged.
 Sheep's Green: several
willows & poplars have lost
big branches; one Lombardy
poplar c. 50ft high and 1½
ft diam. has snapt off
at the base, which was
unexpectedly [!!!!]hollow{!!!!] rotten inside &
with big worm-holes, and
fallen S.; All these have
now been [!!!!]barked[!!!!] defoliated and partly
barked by the cattle.
 Backs: little damage.
 Victoria Avenue: one
horsechestnut capsized
eastwards; several big
branches of elms & willows
by the river.
 Botanic Gardens: a small
Cypressus near the W. end
of the greenhouses has fallen
S.E.wards.

 The hybrid Sempervivum
has finished flowering but
some others are now out.
 The Clematis is nearly
over. 
 The Eccremocarpus has
[11082-11083]
grown to about 6ft above
ground level & is flowering
well.
 Spontaneous Papaver
somniferum contunes to
flourish in the Sarcophagus
& several plant-tubs.
 Spiraea salicifolia is
about the middle of flower-
ing.
 Saponaria ocymoides is
over.
 The miniature rose
flowers well.
 The Onopordon has in-
creased considerably in height.

July 17. [from p.1003]
 The Part II class has
been particularly hindered
in the transpiration ex-
periment by wind damage
to the sunflower & artichoke
plants. The leaves have
been torn & the veins broken.
This is particularly bad
with some sunflowers now
about 18in. high with broad
leaves c. 6in. wide.
 Fairly heavy rain most of
the day.
July 25. [cont. from p.1059]
 The roads from Stamford
to Oakham and Oakham to
Melton Mowbray are ox-droves
with very wide verges. A
[11084-11085]
flock of sheep was encoun-
tered on the road near Emp-
ingham.
 From Melton Mowbray
through Ashfordby, Wymes-
wold, and Rempstone to Sut-
ton Bonington is a very fine
ox-drove with verges perhaps
100 yards wide in places and
sometimes overgrown with
hawthorn scrub.
July 28 [from p.1063]
 Considerable clearing-up
in my garden. The sycamore
was planted in a tub as
it is now c. 4ft high and
had dominated the sarcopha-
gus.
 Gentiana asclepiadea has
grown only 2 stems c. 4in.
high.
July 30.
 There is a young owl in
Leckhampton which sits in
different trees on different
nights and utters a hideous
squawk at about 10-sec.
intervals for hour after
hour. The other owls are
heard less frequently.
July 31.
 For many days there has
been a winter type of anti-
cyclone with dull cold weather
getting out into a warm close afternoon.
August 4.
 The Cobaea has now
[11086-11087]
reached about 6ft long.
The Canary-creeper is
about 4ft high and coming
into flower. The gourds are
only about 2ft high and
show no immediate sign of
flowering.
 Much was done on
inspecting the ancient roof
of the Old Court on N
Staircase.
August 5.
 Risby Poor's Heath (Part IB).
 The soil profile is much
obscured in the pit by motor-
cycling.
 Hypochaeris maculata
was not seen, being apparen-
tly eaten down by a recru-
descence of rabbits.
 The Black Ditch continues
in a S.W. direction across the
road as a ploughed-over
ridge.

 Tuddenham-Icklingham.
 Medicago falcata occurs
on the green at Tuddenham.
 Both birches occur at
Tuddenham and apparently
form an hybrid swarm despite
the supported chromsome
barrier.

 Sisymbrium sophia, Abun-
[11088-11089]
dant as below.
 Apera spica-venti. Abun-
dant on abandoned arable, Tud-
denham.
 Senecio sylvaticus. Sweet
aromatic smell. Disturbed
edge of birch wood.
 Thymus pulegioides. Black
Ditch. Said to smell of small
garages.
 Young oaks are abundant
at the Tuddenham end
among Carex arenaria. Most
are up to 6 years old and
have not yet got above the
Carex, perhaps (DEC) because
of mechanical damage by
the Carex leaves in high
winds.
Birch Wood. Near the road, c.
747724. Not shown on 1in. map.
Amanita rubescens. Very
abundant in the birch wood
on Tuddenham Heath.

 1-year old oak seedlings
are frequent in the birch wood.
 The old heather bushes
in the wood (about 25 years
old) have now rotted away.
Surviving heather and
new seedlings are increasing
though slowly, as the ageing
birch opens out.

Clitocybe aurantiaca. Locally
abundant, birch wood.

 The wood is about 25
years old, resulting from war-
[11090-11091]
time rabbit clearance. Now
opening by self-thinning.
A few old birch and pine
trees survive. Some of the
old pines (originally iso-
lated) have been overtopped &
killed by the birch. Pines
do not otherwise occur in
the wood though trees of
all ages are abundant outside.
 This does not have any
direct relation to the valley
birch wood to the N.

Soils.
 The heath is almost entirely
blown sand or sandy till.
There are no large calcareous
areas. Much of it is dom-
inated either by Calluna or
dense olf turf of Carex
arenaria. There are small
old blow-outs, partly sta-
bilized by Polytrichum pil-
ofenum, near the stream
crossing. These show an ero-
sion pavement of stones from
the sandy till.
 The only profile not ser-
iously disturbed by sand-
blowing, cultivation, or burn-
ing is on the E. side of the
birch wood. A podsol about
8 in. thick.
 A very inquisitive roe doe
was seen in the Cavenham
section.
[11092-11093]
August 9.
Wolferton-Dersingham Fen
Lagg Pool (Part IB Class).
 Water about 1 ft deep.
 Juncus acutiflorus
growing out of the water,
rather like subnodulosus.
 Sphagnum cuspidatum 
is commonly ferruginous
incrusted.
 No Sφ cuspidatum.

 Rhynchospora alba
occurs in pools with Drosera
intermedia.
 Drosera intermedia
grows more in water than
D. rotundifolia, but in water
more than c. 3in. deep
it is usually to be found
on loose hummocks of
Sφ papillosum.

Heathland.
 Calluna in even-aged
blocks. Local areas are
Erica cinerea in even-aged
blocks - on S. facing slopes,
said by D.E.C. to be a fire
climax produced by deep-
-seated fires destroying the
heather completely in which
case Erica is more easily
established from seed.
 Erica is local among
Calluna elsewhere.
 Podsol about 8in. deep.
Iron concretions occur
through the podsol and
[11094-11095]
right to the surface, sug-
gesting previous erosion.
 On tracks the A horizon
of the podsol is very subject
to rain erosion.
 Near the pond, tracks
have been made in the hea-
ther by cutting.
 Colonization by trees
reluctant - a few scattered
pines.

Peat generally.
 Depth usually about
2ft in the N. half - oc-
casionally 3ft 6in. Sometimes
indefintie if the bottom is
blown sand.
 Peat cuttings very dis-
tinct in the iron pan area,
as ridge & furrow with
wavelength c.15ft and amp-
litude c.1½ft. Less evi-
dent in Bay V, but the
whole area has probably
been cut at some time
except Bays VI and VIII. The
less-evidently cut areas
haev sharp-edged though
irregular pools.

Mineral soil.
 Firm under much of
the peat.
 In Bay 5 is an ellipti-
cal mound oriented [!!!!]N.[!!!!] E. & [!!!!]S.[!!!!] W.
and about 10ft long pro-
jecting above the generally
[11096-11097]
Molinia area. Excavation
showed this to be blown
sand. About 4in. of peat cover
 The ridge followed by
the track to the gate is
about 4in. of peat on
sand with a considerable
admixture of angular carr-
stone fragments. Artificial.
 In both these features,
the mineral soil is much
mixed with humus, perhaps
from old roots.

"Lagg".
 A chain of pools about
1ft deep, in peat typically
1½ - 2 ft deep, fringes much
of the bottom of the scarp.
[DIAG]

 There is no evidence of
water movement in this
although some finds its
way out through the cross
ditch.
 The lagg does not usu-
ally abut directly on min-
eral soil. It is surrounded
by an a rea of well-marked
pools & hummocks with
Sφ. cuspidatum, [!!!!]s[!!!!] recurvum,
rubellum, & papillosum,
but not compactum. Nar-
[11098-11099]
thecium and Rhynchospora
occur in such areas. This
is at a slightly lower level
than the body of the bog,
which contains fewer pools
and is less dominated by
Sphagnum.
 The resemblance to a
raised bog is greatest in
bay VI, where the bog
away from the lagg is d[????]ed
and based on Eriophorum,
besides being densely col-
onized by small pines. In
this bay, the head of the 
bay has no lagg and goes
up onto a step of mineral
soil with a thin skin of
peat, with Juncus squarrosus
and Sφ. compactum.

Iron pan.
 Formed only in the N.
of the bog in old peat
cuttings.
 When well developed it
is reddich brown (perhaps
from algae) with a very
thin lemon yellow crust where
it projects fromn the water.
It can be walked on.
The surface under water is
often covered with a black
algal scum. It usually
does not have plants growing
through it.
 Probably associated with
the "spilt petrol" oil scum 
[11100-11101]
bacteria.
 In this area are several
small birch groves with
Molinia. The latter is under-
going a setback : tussocks
are moribund or quite dead
in some areas. A few large
moribund Calluna Bushes
prove that this is not a fire
effect.
 When followed under
a peat balk the iron pan
quickly changed to soft fer-
ruginous mud. It is there-
fore an artefact.

Myrica Gale.
 Very abundant in the N.
part of the bog, forming
patchy pure stands, either by
itself or with birch.
 After fire it coppices
well.

Rubbish tip.
 This affects the bog by
causing fires (a sizeable one
earlier this year spread into
the Myrica) and adding
eutrophic drainage.
 In the drainage area,
mainly Bay VII, Juncus acu-
tiflorus is very large & stout.
J. bufonius and [????]
occur in small quantities.

Trees.
 Birch: general, both spp.
[11102-11103]
x Humulus & Impatiens
[DIAG]
[11104-11105]
Prefer higher ground - e.g.
cross-drove ridge. Some in-
crease in recent years but
many older trees apparently
killed.
 It survives a fire
consumes the lower branches.
If the crown is killed as
well, the trunk may neverthe-
less produce epicormics.

 Pine : scattered through-
out the bog, more abun-
dant in some areas than
others. No trees more than
c. 20 years old.
 In Bay VI, pines are very
abundant, and graduate in
size from those in the
middle of the bay, some
15ft high, and those on
the lower wetter peat of the
"lagg" which although about
8 years old at least may
be only 6in. high and
chlorotic.
 
 Oak : frequent seedlings
but nothing more than a
year old.
 
 Rhododendron : occasional
small but flowering bushes.

Oxycoccus.
 Very abundant particu-
larly in the lagg, but
fruits not yet ripe. They
[11106-11107]
exist in red and spotted
forms.

 Sphagnum palustre is much
less abundant than Sϕ.
papillosum, and occurs mainly
in the N. in drier peat.
 Sϕ. fimbriatum not
found. 
 Cryptothallus not found :
the N. part of the fen does
not match the S. part in its
big Sϕ. fimbriatum tussocks
with Molinia in light shade.
 Rabbits occur in the
fen and appear to eat
Narthecium.
 The sand pits at the
N. end display only soft
strata.
 Bracken is usually cut
off at the edge of the
bog, but occasionally fronds
come up into the peat,
sometimes on islands where
they must have origin-
ated from spores.
 Most of the land over
the railway is arable, but
there are two woods, the
W. one of oak and the E.
one (probably recent coloni-
zation) birch.

 Humulus grows in the
sand pits at the N.E. end.
Young shoots are said to be
eaten as asparagus, but
[11108-11109]
taste of raw French beans.
 Impatiens parviflora
occurs in shade nearby.
 The "gate island" is
entirely covered in bracken.

 Last night there was a
very prolonged thunderstorm,
thunder never very intense
but with heavy rain.
August 10
 A sudden rise in the
river has flooded the
Anchor quay up to the
base of the pub wall.
Much of the Fen is under
water.
August 11.

Anglesea Abbey.
 Many tress in the grounds
are dying at the top - 
sycamore, beech, some elms.

 Two splendid Ulmus
hollandica [!!!!]near[!!!!] in front of the
house - each about 3ft
[????] dia. with a straight
trunk soon forking in two
and giving a fan-shaped
crown. One has been severely
damaged by the gale - 
teh other held. Both
were braced with cable
following previous damage.
 The old trees in the
growunds of Anglesey are all
elms, both glabra and what
[11110-11111]
looks like procera. They
[DIAG]
stand in groups and
belts. Largest about 5ft
dia. and nearly 100ft high.
A giant wych elm near the
[DIAG]
entrance has a vast
spreading crown with 9 iron
cables inserted at at least
2 times.
 Crambe cordifolia is
planted in the great her-
baceous borders - an Ar-
moracia-like plant with
[????] some 6ft high.

 The Warriors' Walk and
Emperors' Walk are two
alleys between plantations
of Norway spruce and
other conifers, planted in
1953 and now being thinned
for the first time. They
have already developed a
characteristic toadstool flora,
including many Lactarius 
deliciosus.
 S.S.W. of the house, in
the S. Glade, are several
old earthworks perhaps re-
lated to the priory. Fur-
ther S. still, in the meadow
between S. Glade and the
road, is a square earthwork
of c. 120 yards a side, of
a shallow ditch (with water
standing) embanked on
both sides. The W. side
coincides with the Daffodil Walk.
 Many beeches have
been lost to the gale in
the belt along the road by
Bottisham Hall.

August 18.
 The two cedars in the
grounds of Madingley Hall
have lost big branches in
the gale.
 One of the two big
Populus nigra N. of Mading-
ley chalk-pit has fallen.
 In Madingley Wood, the
gale damage has been 
slight, and almost confined
to large ashes (shown on
map). None has been
uprooted but several have
lost big branches which
make a considerable gap
in the understorey.
 The elms od Madingley
are very difficult to collect.
The tall ones near the
chalk-pit appear to be
U. hollandica, not elsewhere
in the wood.
 One tree of Salix frag-
ilis, about 1ft diam., was
found on the earthwork.
 Standing water collects
on the S. side of the
earthwork and in other
E.-W. ditches.

 The corn crops by the
Coton footpath are very bad - ears
usually snapped off, stalks
broken, &c. Rumex crispus
much exceeds barley in
height and plants are c.
1ft apart in many places.
Other common weeds which
equal or exceed the corn are:
 Picris echioides
 Euphorbia exigua
 
 Much of this is 6-rowed
barley.

Madingley Wood.
 Very much standing water,
especially in the ditch S. of
compartment 5.
 Several big branches have
fallen from a big ash near the
Large Clearing.

2. Armillaria. Toadstools frequent
Large maple stool on moat

clearing.
 At small clearing (where there
is an incomplete mercury cover
broken down by collapsed
nettles) there are c. 20 plants,
mostly not flowering, over
an area c: 10ft across. The
largest, and almost the only
flowering, are in the dry
zone around the roots of a 
big oke.

 Belt 1d is thus most
like ancient woodland, but
has no ash stools. 1a and
1b are perhaps old ash
wood invaded by elm.
1c appears to be entirely
developed from an over-
grown hedge.

 Little damage to mercury
through waterlogging was 
seen, even in the ditches;
possibly last year's wet
summer set it back suf-
ficiently to avoid damage
in this.
August 19.
 The hybrid Sempervivum
is dead after flowering, but
has produced several living
offsets among the dead
leaves of the rosette.
August 20.
 The gourds are flowering.

 The Nuffield experiment
was harvested today. The 
crop is badly lodged but
there has been no notice-
able loss of grain and no
sprouting.
 The birds at the Plant 
Breeding Institute have
been much reduced by
trapping with a decoy. A
[11126-11127]
large netting funnel about
20x8ft at the mouth is
put up over a crop. The
birds collecting in it are
driven down by a man
into a fine-mesh bag at
the small end.

 Buff Wood (D.E.C., soil
analysis).

 Three pits were dug
to about 2½ft deep in
Compartment A. Sites chosen
to illustrate (a) hornbeam
with mor humus; (b) horn-
beam with clay; (c) clay
with trees other than horn-
beam. Pits fully recorded.
 The wood contains
9 standard hornbeam 
trees. 5 produce a dry
surface humus of the mor
type. 4 produce a mull 
humus rapidly incorporated
into the boulder clay.
Those with mor humus
are on patches of sandy 
soil which usually form
circular hummocks of
about 6in. above the
general level and some
15ft diam. There is no
evidence in the excavation
that these hummocks are
artificial. The formation
of mor appears to require
both the [!!!!] sand and the
[11128-11129]
hornbeam: similar humm-
ocks were seen in B but
had no mor.Standard
hornbeams alone are effec-
tive, perhaps through pro-
ducing large quantitities of
litter. There are two large
coppice hornbeams: one is
on clay and produces mill,
the other on sand and
produces an intermediate
soil type.
 D.E.C. suggests as a
possible mechanism that
the sand originally was
acid enough to exclude
leaf-eating worms.
 The soil is wet espe-
cially in the clay profile. 
Characteristic of the latter
was the strong swinish
smell, particularly evil in
certain humidified root chan-
nels.
 The mor humus layer
is only a few cm thick
but characterized by many
coralloid roots.

 Hazel is now some
5 [!!!!]6[!!!!] high after coppicing.
Hornbeam has put on about
1ft. The promoted horn-
beams have suffered from
wind rocking. One is bent
over at the top and one
has died in the top half
with no obvious surface lesion.

 Solanum nigrum is 
up to c. 18in. high in the

 August 24 North Elmham
 (Norfolk Research Committee)
 Verbascum pulverulentum 
is quite frequent on waste ground
between Laurence & Scott's and
the railway.
 Attlebridge Hills are a site
of possible 3-storeyed woodland,
as also Weston Hall wood, Wes-
ton Longville.
 From Drayton to Billingford
is much acid-sand vegetation
with gorse, broom, and bracken.
Woods mostly oak.
 North Elmham appears to be
on a light boulder-clay with
abundant flints, revealed in
the Elmham Park excavations.
