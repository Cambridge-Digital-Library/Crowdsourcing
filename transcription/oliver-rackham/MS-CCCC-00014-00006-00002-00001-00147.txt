Wicken Fen (Part II).
Oaks on Wicken Fen
 A seedling was found in the
permanent quadrat in the
Godwin Plot X (undisturbed) under
dense Frangula canopy. Dark
green leaves. 2 years old at
least, eaten off at least twice
but producing 2 leaves.
 Near the brick-pits is an
area of Frangula carr with oaks.
Oaks are c. 20ft high and
up to c. 8in diam. No large
branches below c. 10ft high.
These oaks are almost cer-
tainly contemporary with the
carr rather than a later stage
in the succession.
[11054-11055]
 Lysimachia vulgaris has
leaves in 3s on most fertile
stems, but in 2s on most
sterile stems. Occasionally in 4s
on fertile stems.
 Lythrum when vigorous has
leaves in 3s and an hexagonal
(instead of square) stem.
 Most of the recent colon-
ization of the Godwin plots
by [????] is pubescens.
 Peucedanum palustre
now rare in most of the open
areas.
 Glyceria pedicellata is
abundant on a short stretch of
much-trafficked drove by the Rham-
nus Triangle.
 Devil's coachmen are becoming
frequent.
 Utricularia is now abundant
in the E. boundary drain
near the entrance but has
almost vanished from the
brick pits.
 Cladium appears to have
declined in importance in
the fen as a whole.
 Carices are remarkably
few on the main drove, which
now consists of a strip of
Plantago major - Potentilla
anserina turf down the
middle, and bands of Juncus 
articulatus down the sides
separating this from the fen.
 The minor droves
usually have Juncus arti-
[11056-11057]
culatus but not the spp
of the very trodden central
strip.
 Lemna gibba is the 
commonest sp. in the E. boundary
ditch near the entrance. L.
minor & trisulca are less
abundant. Spirodela and Azol-
la have not been seen this
year.
 Sagittaria is frequent in
Drainer's Ditch.
 Thelypteris is a common
plant under carr.
 Galium palustre is on
the whole a plant of tall
fen with Phragmites, Phalaris,
&c. Mown Molinia fen has
G. uliginosum. Tall fen has
the most spp in common with
Hayley, e.g.
Galium palustre
Cirsium palustre
Lychnis flos-cuculi

 Many spp of Epilobium
occur in the fen, mainly in
areas disturbed by bush
clearing &c. Those seen in-
clude :
E. montanum
parviflorum
roseum
adenocaulon x palustre
 The Triangle is said to
be a remnant of the Rhamnus
carr (sometimes regarded as
[11058-11059]
successional to Frangula)
which dominated wide areas
in the past but has now
been reduced partly by the
1950 fire and partly by
its greater ease of clearing.
 To the N. of the fen one
field separates it from [????].
 A fine dragon-fly was seen
at the N. end of Drainers'
Ditch.
 Ranunculus Lingua has
greatly increased but is still
in the same area, Φ. 16
 There is [!!!!]no sign of[!!!!] little gale
damage on the Fen or any-
where on the roads from Cam-
bridge via Stretham or the
Swaffhams.
July 25.
Sutton Bonington
Whitwell Wood, near Oakham,
Rutland. An oak-ash
wood with much sycamore &
some (apparently marginal)
elm. No coppice. The E.
end of the wood appears to
have disappeared, and the
roadside clearing is very
wide in most of its length
and not very convincing.
 No signs of gale damage
to trees outside Cambs, but
much corn is flattened.
 The Nuffield experiment this
year is on a field with
slight ridge & furrow in two
directions at right angles.

Elm collections
1. Top of young tree.
2. Side branch of young tree.
3. Side branches of 2 young
3'. trees in the E. spinney (by
railway).
[!!!!]4[!!!!]5' Side branch of small
tree under a canopy gap.
This elm differs from all the
others in having numerous fine
epicormic shoots, with large
petiolate leaves, all the way
up the trunk & larger bran-
[11062-11063]
ches.
4. Side branch of small tree.
5. Canopy specimen secured
from a fallen branch.
6. Mature tree at edge of wood.
7. Side branch of small tree.
8. Small tree at edge of wood.

Brambles.
1. Apparently frequent in
the wood. Stem and panicle
both slightly glandular, with-
out acicles. Petals pale pink,
crumpled, shortly clawed. Flowers
2½ cm diam., petals 11mm long.
Stamens lomger than styles,
fil. white, anthers glabrous.
Petals hairy.
 Rubus pyramidalis? agrees fairly
well, but stem leaves not
green-felted below.

2. Also frequent. Stem & panicles
with many glands & acicles.
Petals broad, pink, not crumpled,
not clawed. Flowers 18mm diam,
petals 10mm long. Stamens
white, glabrous anthers, much
longer than styles. Styles
greenish. Petals glabrous.
 Rubus inopacatus.
 
Epilobium 1 is montanum. 

 Lathyrus latifolius. 2 plants
in railway verge.
 The N. railway track has
had a train on it recently.
[11064-11065]
 Juncus effusus is the
common sp. in the coppice area.
 There is remarkably little
gale damage. The largest
broken branch seen was of
an elm, c. 4 in. dia. (from
which came specimen 5). Fallen
twigs are frequent. Foliage
shredding is rare. The S.W.
corner was visited but no
more damage seen.
 The path along the S.
margin has been much used
recently. A test tube with a
rather complex set of substances
inside was found apparently
dropped.
1. Tremella mesenterica. A nea[????]y
turgid specimen on ash in the
S. Section
 A single hind was found
lying in bushes in the S.W.
corner.
 Juncus. All three spp at
cross-roads. 
 Hypericum tetrapterum.
Cross-roads. 
 No visible differences inside
& outside the deer-fence
plot.
 The cutting of Middle Hayley
Lane has been postponed be-
cause Mr Cooper says he saw
nestling birds coming out into
the opening & an old crow
came down and swallowed
them one after the other.
 Mosquitoes are not bad.
[11066-11067]
[DIAG]
 Much deer activity in
the E. section.
 The tree-top hide is
now usable.
 The pond is exceptionally
high (above its usual maxi-
mum in winter). The black
holes do not contain any
water. The pool near the
middle of Hayley Lane has
some. There must have been
a substantial escape at the
S.W. corner.
 South Hayley Lane is very
overgrown with tall herbs and
coppicing bushes. 
 The Carex [!!!!]near[!!!!] on 3rd N. Ride
is not fruiting; the patch
under trees is very weak.
 July 28. see p. 1084.
[11068-11069]
 July 29. Buff Wood.
1. In large numbers on
sticks (see map).
Crepidotus mollis.

2. Abundant in the S.E. half.
Coprinus disseminatus.

3. One in poor condition on
the main ride.
Probably Lacrimaria lacrimabun-
dum?

4. Two side by side under
poplars in the Lane 3-2¼-⅝.
 P. flat, bright cherry pink,
darker at margin but other-
wise uniform, no yellow
or green tinge, smooth, +
shiny, very humid & somewhat
viscid, peeling with some dif-
ficulty & leaving some of the
colour behind, edge slightly striate.
 S. cylindric but irregular,
white, smooth, matt, dry,
stuffed, light-weight.
 L. thin, crowded, equal,
broad, adnexed, connected
by veins at base, pale
[!!!!]lemon[!!!!] cream yellow, fragile.
 C. thin, white, reddish
under pellicle, chalky, fun-
gus smell, no taste.

Russula velenovskyi
 det. 1981 with Rayner key.
[11070-11071]
[DIAG]
5. Several in groups on
elm logs in the S.W. field
(see map). 5-2½-¾. Two
or more sometimes joined
at the extreme base.
 P. an irregular inverted
cone, margin turned downwards,
deep buff with a smoky
tinge, + irregularly lobed,
uniform in colour, humid
but not viscous, matt.
 S. excentric, cylindrical,
deeply sulcate, cartilaginous,
very tough and rubbery,
solid, cream above, chocolate
brown below, blackish at
very base, smooth, matt,
humid.
 P.S. uniform, smooth,
cream, not sharply demarcated
from S. Pores remarkably
small (100μ dia.), and
short (c. 120μ long), spaced
at about 7 to the mm,
round.
 C. thin, whitish, rather
[11072-11073]
tough, polyporine smell.
[DIAG]

Polyporus varius [????]gg
H.J.H. is uncertain
which species.

 Oak and beech are now
almost the only species re-
cognizable in the litter.
 Euonymus is scattered
through the wood and frequent
in the area shown.
 Two plants of Ranunculus
sceleratus occur in the 1968
coppice, both on bonfire sites.

 Elm specimen: Side branch
of a small tree in the S. W. field.

 The nettles inside the S. W.
moat grew about 4ft high
this year but are now
completely laid like a field
of corn. They have shown no
tendency to get up again,
and many of the leaves are
rotten, but a second crop
[11074-11075]
is coming from erect axillary
branches. Galium aparine is
more flourishing than usual.
 Orchis mascula appears
to rot down with remarkable
speed as no sign of it could
be found in its known sites.
 There are about 4 plants
of Platanthera in the 1968
coppice. One produced an
abortive inflorescence.
 Most of the Epilobium in
the 1968 coppice is montanum.
Parviflorum and adenocaulon
occur but are mush rarer.
 Galeobdolon is [????] in
the 1968 coppice, mainly in
the poplar section.
 Veronica chamaedrys is
frequent in the 1968 coppice,
usually with a terminal leafy
gall replacing the inflorescence.
 V. serpyllifolia occurs on
the N.E.-S.W. ride.
 One primrose was
found in flower. Both spp
of violets are flowering
fairly frequently – all in
the coppice.

Coppice regeneration
 Hazel c. 15in. high from
all stools.
 Ash c. 3ft.
 Hornbeam c. 4in.
 Poplar – abundant suckers
of P. tremula; P. canadensis
forms a remarkable ring
