Wicken Fen (Part II).
Oaks on Wicken Fen
A seedling was found in the
permanent quadrat in the
Godwin Plot X (undisturbed) under
dense Frangula canopy. Dark
green leaves. 2 years old at
least, eaten off at least twice
but producing 2 leaves.
Near the brick-pits is an
area of Frangula carr with oaks.
Oaks are c. 20ft high and
up to c. 8in diam. No large
branches below c. 10ft high.
These oaks are almost cer-
tainly contemporary with the
carr rather than a later stage
in the succession.
[11054-11055]
Lysimachia vulgaris has
leaves in 3s on most fertile
stems, but in 2s on most
sterile stems. Occasionally in 4s
on fertile stems.
Lythrum when vigorous has
leaves in 3s and an hexagonal
(instead of square) stem.
Most of the recent colon-
ization of the Godwin plots
by [????] is pubescens.
Peucedanum palustre
now rare in most of the open
areas.
Glyceria pedicellata is
abundant on a short stretch of
much-trafficked drove by the Rham-
nus Triangle.
Devil's coachmen are becoming
frequent.
Utricularia is now abundant
in the E. boundary drain
near the entrance but has
almost vanished from the
brick pits.
Cladium appears to have
declined in importance in
the fen as a whole.
Carices are remarkably
few on the main drove, which
now consists of a strip of
Plantago major - Potentilla
anserina turf down the
middle, and bands of Juncus 
articulatus down the sides
separating this from the fen.
The minor droves
usually have Juncus arti-
[11056-11057]
culatus but not the spp
of the very trodden central
strip.
Lemna gibba is the 
commonest sp. in the E. boundary
ditch near the entrance. L.
minor & trisulca are less
abundant. Spirodela and Azol-
la have not been seen this
year.
Sagittaria is frequent in
Drainer's Ditch.
Thelypteris is a common
plant under carr.
Galium palustre is on
the whole a plant of tall
fen with Phragmites, Phalaris,
&c. Mown Molinia fen has
G. uliginosum. Tall fen has
the most spp in common with
Hayley, e.g.
Galium palustre
Cirsium palustre
Lychnis flos-cuculi

Many spp of Epilobium
occur in the fen, mainly in
areas disturbed by bush
clearing &c. Those seen in-
clude :
E. montanum
parviflorum
roseum
adenocaulon x palustre
The Triangle is said to
be a remnant of the Rhamnus
carr (sometimes regarded as
[11058-11059]
successional to Frangula)
which dominated wide areas
in the past but has now
been reduced partly by the
1950 fire and partly by
its greater ease of clearing.
To the N. of the fen one
field separates it from [????].
A fine dragon-fly was seen
at the N. end of Drainers'
Ditch.
Ranunculus Lingua has
greatly increased but is still
in the same area, Φ. 16
There is [!!!!]no sign of[!!!!] little gale
damage on the Fen or any-
where on the roads from Cam-
bridge via Stretham or the
Swaffhams.
July 25.
Sutton Bonington
Whitwell Wood, near Oakham,
Rutland. An oak-ash
wood with much sycamore &
some (apparently marginal)
elm. No coppice. The E.
end of the wood appears to
have disappeared, and the
roadside clearing is very
wide in most of its length
and not very convincing.
No signs of gale damage
to trees outside Cambs, but
much corn is flattened.
The Nuffield experiment this
year is on a field with
slight ridge & furrow in two
directions at right angles.

Agrostis stol[????].
Hyper. hi[????].

Railway
Galium verum
Campanula glomer. c. 50
flowering stems not yet out
Ivy
Rhinanthus stenophyllus

Elm collections
1. Top of young tree.
2. Side branch of young tree.
3. Side branches of 2 young
3'. trees in the E. spinney (by
railway).
[!!!!]4[!!!!]5' Side branch of small
tree under a canopy gap.
This elm differs from all the
others in having numerous fine
epicormic shoots, with large
petiolate leaves, all the way
up the trunk & larger bran-
[11062-11063]
ches.
4. Side branch of small tree.
5. Canopy specimen secured
from a fallen branch.
6. Mature tree at edge of wood.
7. Side branch of small tree.
8. Small tree at edge of wood.

Brambles.
1. Apparently frequent in
the wood. Stem and panicle
both slightly glandular, with-
out acicles. Petals pale pink,
crumpled, shortly clawed. Flowers
2½ cm diam., petals 11mm long.
Stamens lomger than styles,
fil. white, anthers glabrous.
Petals hairy.
Rubus pyramidalis? agrees fairly
well, but stem leaves not
green-felted below.

2. Also frequent. Stem & panicles
with many glands & acicles.
Petals broad, pink, not crumpled,
not clawed. Flowers 18mm diam,
petals 10mm long. Stamens
white, glabrous anthers, much
longer than styles. Styles
greenish. Petals glabrous.
Rubus inopacatus.
 
Epilobium 1 is montanum. 

Lathyrus latifolius. 2 plants
in railway verge.
The N. railway track has
had a train on it recently.
[11064-11065]
Juncus effusus is the
common sp. in the coppice area.
There is remarkably little
gale damage. The largest
broken branch seen was of
an elm, c. 4 in. dia. (from
which came specimen 5). Fallen
twigs are frequent. Foliage
shredding is rare. The S.W.
corner was visited but no
more damage seen.
The path along the S.
margin has been much used
recently. A test tube with a
rather complex set of substances
inside was found apparently
dropped.
1. Tremella mesenterica. A nearly
turgid specimen on ash in the
S. Section
A single hind was found
lying in bushes in the S.W.
corner.
Juncus. All three spp at
cross-roads. 
Hypericum tetrapterum.
Cross-roads. 
No visible differences inside
& outside the deer-fence
plot.
The cutting of Middle Hayley
Lane has been postponed be-
cause Mr Cooper says he saw
nestling birds coming out into
the opening & an old crow
came down and swallowed
them one after the other.
Mosquitoes are not bad.
[11066-11067]
[DIAG]
Much deer activity in
the E. section.
The tree-top hide is
now usable.
The pond is exceptionally
high (above its usual maxi-
mum in winter). The black
holes do not contain any
water. The pool near the
middle of Hayley Lane has
some. There must have been
a substantial escape at the
S.W. corner.
South Hayley Lane is very
overgrown with tall herbs and
coppicing bushes. 
The Carex nearly on 3rd N. Ride
is not fruiting; the patch
under trees is very weak.
July 28. see p. 1084.
[11068-11069]
July 29. Buff Wood.
1. In large numbers on
sticks (see map).
Crepidotus mollis.

2. Abundant in the S.E. half.
Coprinus disseminatus.

3. One in poor condition on
the main ride.
Probably Lacrimaria lacrimabun-
dum?

4. Two side by side under
poplars in the Lane 3-2¼-⅝.
P. flat, bright cherry pink,
darker at margin but other-
wise uniform, no yellow
or green tinge, smooth, +
shiny, very humid & somewhat
viscid, peeling with some dif-
ficulty & leaving some of the
colour behind, edge slightly striate.
S. cylindric but irregular,
white, smooth, matt, dry,
stuffed, light-weight.
 L. thin, crowded, equal,
broad, adnexed, connected
by veins at base, pale
[!!!!]lemon[!!!!] cream yellow, fragile.
C. thin, white, reddish
under pellicle, chalky, fun-
gus smell, no taste.

Russula velenovskyi
det. 1981 with Rayner key.
[11070-11071]
[DIAG]
5. Several in groups on
elm logs in the S.W. field
(see map). 5-2½-¾. Two
or more sometimes joined
at the extreme base.
P. an irregular inverted
cone, margin turned downwards,
deep buff with a smoky
tinge, + irregularly lobed,
uniform in colour, humid
but not viscous, matt.
S. excentric, cylindrical,
deeply sulcate, cartilaginous,
very tough and rubbery,
solid, cream above, chocolate
brown below, blackish at
very base, smooth, matt,
humid.
P.S. uniform, smooth,
cream, not sharply demarcated
from S. Pores remarkably
small (100μ dia.), and
short (c. 120μ long), spaced
at about 7 to the mm,
round.
C. thin, whitish, rather
[11072-11073]
tough, polyporine smell.
[DIAG]

Polyporus varius [????]gg
H.J.H. is uncertain
which species.

Oak and beech are now
almost the only species re-
cognizable in the litter.
Euonymus is scattered
through the wood and frequent
in the area shown.
Two plants of Ranunculus
sceleratus occur in the 1968
coppice, both on bonfire sites.

Elm specimen: Side branch
of a small tree in the S. W. field.

The nettles inside the S. W.
moat grew about 4ft high
this year but are now
completely laid like a field
of corn. They have shown no
tendency to get up again,
and many of the leaves are
rotten, but a second crop
[11074-11075]
is coming from erect axillary
branches. Galium aparine is
more flourishing than usual.
Orchis mascula appears
to rot down with remarkable
speed as no sign of it could
be found in its known sites.
There are about 4 plants
of Platanthera in the 1968
coppice. One produced an
abortive inflorescence.
Most of the Epilobium in
the 1968 coppice is montanum.
Parviflorum and adenocaulon
occur but are mush rarer.
Galeobdolon is [????] in
the 1968 coppice, mainly in
the poplar section.
Veronica chamaedrys is
frequent in the 1968 coppice,
usually with a terminal leafy
gall replacing the inflorescence.
V. serpyllifolia occurs on
the N.E.-S.W. ride.
One primrose was
found in flower. Both spp
of violets are flowering
fairly frequently – all in
the coppice.

Coppice regeneration
Hazel c. 15in. high from
all stools.
Ash c. 3ft.
Hornbeam c. 4in.
Poplar – abundant suckers
of P. tremula; P. canadensis
forms a remarkable ring
[11076-11077]
[DIAG]
of brilliant red sucker shoots
from the cambium.
Rides cut this year
were the N.E-S.W., and the
N.W.-S.E. as far as the
crossroads.
Cirsium arvense is the
commonest thistle in the
coppice, almost certainly
from seed. Not associated
[11078-11079]
particularly with bonfires.

Carex in moat. Sterile and
indeterminate: along a stretch
of about 10 yards.
July 15 (from p.1002).
Gale damage between
Harwich and Colchester has
been considerable. Many
trees (usually [!!!!]isolated[!!!!] in hedges) are
uprooted and lie towards the S.E. or E.S.E.
July 16 (from p.1002) [DIAG]
Gale damage in Cambridge.
This is said to have
occurred between 5 & 6 a.m.
on July 11.
Leckhampton: many branches
up to c. 6 in. dia. fallen from
Robinia trees in the loke;
no comparable damage to
any other trees but smaller
branches broken from Ailan-
thus &c.; foliage badly
[11080-11081]
shredded on horsechestnuts,
especially isolated trees, and
twigs broken.
A few branches broken
on plane trees in Sidgwick
Avenue.
Queens' Piece: many
branches up to c. 3in. diam.
broken from the crowns of
lime trees, some still lodged.
Sheep's Green: several
willows & poplars have lost
big branches; one Lombardy
poplar c. 50ft high and 1½
ft diam. has snapt off
at the base, which was
unexpectedly [!!!!]hollow{!!!!] rotten inside &
with big worm-holes, and
fallen S.; All these have
now been [!!!!]barked[!!!!] defoliated and partly
barked by the cattle.
Backs: little damage.
Victoria Avenue: one
horsechestnut capsized
eastwards; several big
branches of elms & willows
by the river.
Botanic Gardens: a small
Cypressus near the W. end
of the greenhouses has fallen
S.E.wards.

The hybrid Sempervivum
has finished flowering but
some others are now out.
The Clematis is nearly
over. 
The Eccremocarpus has
[11082-11083]
grown to about 6ft above
ground level & is flowering
well.
Spontaneous Papaver
somniferum contunes to
flourish in the Sarcophagus
& several plant-tubs.
Spiraea salicifolia is
about the middle of flower-
ing.
Saponaria ocymoides is
over.
The miniature rose
flowers well.
The Onopordon has in-
creased considerably in height.

July 17. [from p.1003]
 The Part II class has
been particularly hindered
in the transpiration ex-
periment by wind damage
to the sunflower & artichoke
plants. The leaves have
been torn & the veins broken.
This is particularly bad
with some sunflowers now
about 18in. high with broad
leaves c. 6in. wide.
Fairly heavy rain most of
the day.
July 25. [cont. from p.1059]
The roads from Stamford
to Oakham and Oakham to
Melton Mowbray are ox-droves
with very wide verges. A
[11084-11085]
flock of sheep was encoun-
tered on the road near Emp-
ingham.
From Melton Mowbray
through Ashfordby, Wymes-
wold, and Rempstone to Sut-
ton Bonington is a very fine
ox-drove with verges perhaps
100 yards wide in places and
sometimes overgrown with
hawthorn scrub.
July 28 [from p.1063]
Considerable clearing-up
in my garden. The sycamore
was planted in a tub as
it is now c. 4ft high and
had dominated the sarcopha-
gus.
Gentiana asclepiadea has
grown only 2 stems c. 4in.
high.
July 30.
There is a young owl in
Leckhampton which sits in
different trees on different
nights and utters a hideous
squawk at about 10-sec.
intervals for hour after
hour. The other owls are
heard less frequently.
July 31.
For many days there has
been a winter type of anti-
cyclone with dull cold weather
getting out into a warm close afternoon.
August 4.
The Cobaea has now
[11086-11087]
reached about 6ft long.
The Canary-creeper is
about 4ft high and coming
into flower. The gourds are
only about 2ft high and
show no immediate sign of
flowering.
Much was done on
inspecting the ancient roof
of the Old Court on N
Staircase.
August 5.
Risby Poor's Heath (Part IB).
The soil profile is much
obscured in the pit by motor-
cycling.
Hypochaeris maculata
was not seen, being apparen-
tly eaten down by a recru-
descence of rabbits.
The Black Ditch continues
in a S.W. direction across the
road as a ploughed-over
ridge.

Tuddenham-Icklingham.
Medicago falcata occurs
on the green at Tuddenham.
Both birches occur at
Tuddenham and apparently
form an hybrid swarm despite
the supported chromsome
barrier.

Sisymbrium sophia, Abun-
[11088-11089]
dant as below.
Apera spica-venti. Abun-
dant on abandoned arable, Tud-
denham.
Senecio sylvaticus. Sweet
aromatic smell. Disturbed
edge of birch wood.
Thymus pulegioides. Black
Ditch. Said to smell of small
garages.
Young oaks are abundant
at the Tuddenham end
among Carex arenaria. Most
are up to 6 years old and
have not yet got above the
Carex, perhaps (DEC) because
of mechanical damage by
the Carex leaves in high
winds.
Birch Wood. Near the road, c.
747724. Not shown on 1in. map.
Amanita rubescens. Very
abundant in the birch wood
on Tuddenham Heath.

1-year old oak seedlings
are frequent in the birch wood.
The old heather bushes
in the wood (about 25 years
old) have now rotted away.
Surviving heather and
new seedlings are increasing
though slowly, as the ageing
birch opens out.

Clitocybe aurantiaca. Locally
abundant, birch wood.

The wood is about 25
years old, resulting from war-
[11090-11091]
time rabbit clearance. Now
opening by self-thinning.
