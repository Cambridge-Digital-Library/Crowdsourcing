Tadlow Towers - Robert Taylor

[4665]
19 May 1971
Hedge & Coppice 
meeting cont. 

Chevin's Wood, Rougham.
[DIAG]
Wood largely coniferized. 
Marginal strip contains nu-
merous oaks and some cherry. 
Only the N. handle 
entered. About 20 yards in

[4666-4667]

from the W. the ground
rises abruptly (probably a 
natural gravel cap) and there
is a bracken area. Nettles
near the margin. No Primula
seen. 
Probably a "light" wood,
secondary or much in-
fluenced by the adjoining 
settlement. 

The hedge AB is a typical
mixed one with more species 
than usual. 
At BC the ditch rapidly 
changes from an ordinary 
field ditch to one of about 
the dimensions of the Brad-
field fish-pond. This is now 

known to be the only sur-
viving limb of a moat 
whose ploughed-out remains 
are clearly visible in the field
to the S. Moat hexagonal 
or irregularly rounded; ap-
parently not involved in
the wood-bank. Direction
of up-cast uncertain. Site
full of early medieval pot-
tery. 
Alongside the deep ditch
are some pollard elms (and
suckers) of a procera-like
type. Around C are elms 
of a carpinifolia type, much 
taller and with more suckers. 
The elm portion of the 
hedge has fewer species than

[4668-4669]
the remainder. 

May 20. 
Devil's-coachmen beetles
have been seen in small 
numbers in barley at Trum-
pington. 
May 21. 
The monocotyledonous 
succulent in my rooms has 
finished flowering.
May 22. 
Two Ipo[????] plants from
the market planted outside 
my rooms. 
May 23. 
Under the great copper 

beech in front of the George 
Thomson building, Leckhamp-
ton, is a structure like a 
small loose witches'-broom 
which is later coming into 
leaf than the rest of the tree. 
May 24. 
Bubbling and squawking 
of owls is incessant at 
night.
May 25. 
Trumpington railway cutting. 
Vicia hirsuta: dominant 
in large patches of several 
square yards, in ground 
with slight disturbance (?
due to last year's paraquat). 
V. sativa: dominant, and 
forming dense strands to c. 


[4670-4671]
3 ft high, along the S. 
lip of the cutting and some
way down the slope. Also 
a plant of mild distur-
bance. 
Lamium amplexicaule: abun-
dant on the S. lip of the 
cutting. Associated with 
more severe disturbance
(trench-digging). 
The Hieracium is coming 
into flower on a large 
scale.
