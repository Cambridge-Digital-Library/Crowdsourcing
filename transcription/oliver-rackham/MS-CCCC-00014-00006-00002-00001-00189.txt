Tadlow Towers - Robert Taylor

[4665]
19 May 1971
Hedge & Coppice 
meeting cont. 

Chevin's Wood, Rougham.
[DIAG]
Wood largely coniferized. 
Marginal strip contains nu-
merous oaks and some cherry. 
Only the N. handle 
entered. About 20 yards in

[4666-4667]

from the W. the ground
rises abruptly (probably a 
natural gravel cap) and there
is a bracken area. Nettles
near the margin. No Primula
seen. 
Probably a "light" wood,
secondary or much in-
fluenced by the adjoining 
settlement. 

The hedge AB is a typical
mixed one with more species 
than usual. 
At BC the ditch rapidly 
changes from an ordinary 
field ditch to one of about 
the dimensions of the Brad-
field fish-pond. This is now 

known to be the only sur-
viving limb of a moat 
whose ploughed-out remains 
are clearly visible in the field
to the S. Moat hexagonal 
or irregularly rounded; ap-
parently not involved in
the wood-bank. Direction
of up-cast uncertain. Site
full of early medieval pot-
tery. 
Alongside the deep ditch
are some pollard elms (and
suckers) of a procera-like
type. Around C are elms 
of a carpinifolia type, much 
taller and with more suckers. 
The elm portion of the 
hedge has fewer species than

[4668-4669]
the remainder. 

May 20. 
Devil's-coachmen beetles
have been seen in small 
numbers in barley at Trum-
pington. 
May 21. 
The monocotyledonous 
succulent in my rooms has 
finished flowering.
May 22. 
Two Ipo[????] plants from
the market planted outside 
my rooms. 
May 23. 
Under the great copper 

beech in front of the George 
Thomson building, Leckhamp-
ton, is a structure like a 
small loose witches'-broom 
which is later coming into 
leaf than the rest of the tree. 
May 24. 
Bubbling and squawking 
of owls is incessant at 
night.
May 25. 
Trumpington railway cutting. 
Vicia hirsuta: dominant 
in large patches of several 
square yards, in ground 
with slight disturbance (?
due to last year's paraquat). 
V. sativa: dominant, and 
forming dense strands to c. 


[4670-4671]
3 ft high, along the S. 
lip of the cutting and some
way down the slope. Also 
a plant of mild distur-
bance. 
Lamium amplexicaule: abun-
dant on the S. lip of the 
cutting. Associated with 
more severe disturbance
(trench-digging). 
The Hieracium is coming 
into flower on a large 
scale. 
May 26
Hesperis is flowering
freely in the Sarcophagus.
May 27. 
Urtica pilulifera grows
in Pembroke College, in a 

flower-bed at the foot of 
the wall of the living buil-
ding near the Tennis Court 
Road gate. About 2ft high. 
Monoecious. Glaucous. Stem 
glabrous apart from large
scattered stinging hairs. Leaves
cordate, long-stalked. Female 
flowers in curious heads 
about 1/2 in. dia. on stalks. 
Not obviously planted. I 
could not get it to sting. 
May 25. 
Gourd seeds planted in 
a large box of soil. 
May 31. 
Tropaeolum canariensis 
and 22 Ipomoea seeds 
planted in tubs. 


[4672-4673]
[DIAG] 

Lathyrus Aphaca is very 
abundant to dominant over
about 1 acre of ground, fal-
low and probably unplowed 
for several years, at the E. 
end of "Short's Factory" on
the Coton footpath. [!!!!]Site[!!!!] Also
scattered plants and groups 
on the strip of land to the E.,
fallow for two years. Known to
J. Evans for many years. 

June 2. 
Reversed - S as strips of 
[????]dging in barley field
by Kingston railway bridge. 
[DIAG] 
Ears emerged on many barley 
fields in the Toft area. 

Hayley Wood. 
Lesser Perambulation with
the Committee. 

Typha latifolia grows in 
the southern roadside ditch
of the Longstowe road. 

[4674-4675]
Most of the newly planted
hawthorn hedge is growing. 
Cooper. A new pit was dug
at the entrance to Hayley Lane
about a day before the arrival 
of the Committee, and during 
the visit to the wood "No 
Vehicles" was painted on one
of the level-crossing gates.
Two double-headed dan-
delion fasciations in Hayley
Lane. 
No sign of Neottia. 
The ancient pollard oak
is quite flourishing after the
removal of some moribund 
branches and has put forth
some small new twigs from
near the base of the sur-

viving limb. 
The deer fence appears
to be intact. Little difference
across it. 
Tree hide inspected and 
found to be sound (O.R. &
G. McBride together in it). 
The oaks in Great Glade
have come into leaf but
are already overtopped by 
herbaceous vegetation. 
Genista tinctoria is flour-
ishing in the Roundabout. 
Ash Swamp is merely
damp. 
Two small pollard oaks 
(c. 2ft x 6ft) grow on 
the wood-bank S. of Great
Glade. 

[4676-4677]
Mr Cox's field W. of the
Wood is curiously derelict
with a mixture of sparse
beans (probably volunteers)
and rough grass. A few
rabbits seen to the S.W. of the
Wood. 

Lacrimaria lacrymabundum.
Probably this seen in S.W. ride

The Great Pond is about
9in. below its maximum
level. Much Callitriche. Alisma
Plantago not seen. 
Littlehound has not come
into leaf and was therefore
burnt in the great fire. 
The tyre dump has little or 

not increased since last visit
but there are 6 tyres E. of 
the level-crossing which were 
not there before. 
Melampyrum not found. 
The Wood is slightly 
damp in hollows. 
June 3. 
Papaver argemone [DIAG] is 
rather abundant on [DIAG] the 
headlands at Trumpington; 
flowers earlier than P. rhoeas. 
June 4. 
Excavation at Trumping-
ton has revealed several 
earthworms coiled up in
compact knots at a 

[4678-4679]
depth of about 18in. Al-
though below the plow layer,
at a depth in which chan-
nels are present (though 
poorly defined), the worms
are in the undisturbed
subsoil away from channels. 
June 6. 
Allium moly is flowering 
in the Botanical Gardens. A
small narrow-leaved glauc-
ous plant with bright yel-
low flowers. 
Davidia (Handkerchief Tree, 
Nyssaceae) has a curious
and complex inflorescence with
large conspicuous white
bracts. 
Bracken fronds fully ex-

panded in part (Bot. Gard.). 
Osmunda fronds are fully 
expanded and the sporangia
not far from dehiscence. 
June 7.
One of the tall vegeta-
-type elms in Leckhampton,
about 1/3 way down the 
lime avenue, has a very
thin crown due to the failure
of many leaves. The sur-
viving leaves are spaced
out along the twigs and
appear to be complete and
healthy. No evidence of
caterpillar attack. Similar
but less severe symptoms 
are frequent on hollandica-
-type elms elsewhere in 

[4680-4681]
Cambridge. Tree has a 
slime flux from the scar of
a large branch cut off some 
2 years ago. 
Elms by the Bin Brook
in the S.W. corner of the 
playing field have crown 
symptoms of wet-wood (John 
Rishbeth). Main upper 
branches extensively dead. 
No evidence of Dutch elm
disease. 
The "thin" elm is on 
the line of dying trees lead-
ing to the first gap in the 
horsechestnut avenue. At least
two Prunuses on the line 
are moribund. 

June 11. 
Onopordun - about 12 
plants by the A11 in Kennett.
Also some by the E. Harling 
to Eccles road near Harling
Farm. Bridgham and Brettenham 
Heaths are much overgrown 
with bushes and birch
trees, especially N. of the
road. 
Weather and Horn Heaths 
are mainly Callunetum, 
still relatively free from 
scrub and trees. 

East Harling Fen. With M. 
Kirby and D. Grant; demon-
stration of the Minuteman

[4682-4683]
[DIAG]
soil auger, being used by the 
Great Ouse River Authority for
geological surveying. 
At A, S. of the road, the
chalk is overlain by several
feet of sand. 
N. of the road is a 
curious mixture of arable, rushes,
furze, and a scrubby wood-

land. Land surface with 
many large shallow hollows, 
some of them cultivated, 
others with rushes, one with
water. These show no sign 
of being pingres. Perfor-
mance of the crop (Proctor
barley) very variable; appar-
ently affected by both drought
and waterlogging. No peat
in the immediate area (see
map). 
Bore-hole at B showed
chalk at c.3ft deep. 
The hedge shown is a 
mixed one with a number
of large beech stools, very
overgrown. Most of the 
beeches, unlike the other

[4684-4685]
species, failed to come into
leaf this year. 

Brettenham Drove. 
Strip by the road is 
cultivated again. Furze on
the remainder appears to
have much increased in
recent years. 
Stone-stripes visible in 
barley in nearby fields (by
lodging). 

Ipomoea seedlings have
started to emerge.
June 12. 
The two black poplars by 
Fen Ditton Stump are about 
4ft dia. and 80ft high. 

Bosses on trunk and bran-
ches; fissured bark; arching
branches. Many leaves dis-
torted and with thickened
gall patches. No trace of
suckers. Twigs were collec-
ted and put in water to
develop roots. 
June 13. 
The Saponaria in the 
Sarcophagus has reached a
spectacular size and hemi-
spherical form. Flowers now
fully open, covering the
whole outside of the plant. 
June 14. 
Oxlips planted in the
Leckhampton lane from 
Hempstead Wood are flour-

[4686-4687]
ishing with numerous new
leaves. 
June 17. 
Tropaeolum seedlings
emerged. 
Ipomoeas are still al-
most wholly yellow.
The large golden poplar 
in Leckhampton has died 
back severely this year, in-
cluding some quite large 
branches. No evidence of
cause; probably not caused
by squirrel damage. 
Japanese barleys (grown 
at the Plant Breeding Insti-
tute) are curious plants with
numerous surviving sterile 
tillers, massive glaucous culms,

leaves nearly 1 in. wide, and 
glaucous ears with short very
stout bright green awns.
6-rowed. Badly attacked by
both mildew and brown
rust. 
June 19. 
Lakenheath Warren. 
[DIAG] 
Warren Banks. 
[DIAG]. 

[4688-4689]
[DIAG] 
Boletus scaber 
[DIAG]
By Eriswell High Warren
[DIAG]
By the E. end of 
Eriswell High W. 

On the S. side of the Warren
is a fairly pronounced bank
with a slight inner ditch,
in places a double bank. 
Terrace formed where the 
bank abuts on rising ground.
The bank follows a slightly 
sinuous course at varying
distances from the fence
which everywhere separates
Lakenheath from Eriswell. 
The supposed line of the
parish boundary is marked
by concrete posts, usually
between the bank and the fence 
but on the bank itself
at the E. end. 

[4690-4691]
Dryopteris spinulosa. Out 
in the open among Ox[????], 
c. 150 yards from N. edge 
by E. end of Wangford Warren. 
Numerous plants to as far W. as Shakers' Road. 
Potentilla erecta. One
plant in the same place. 
[DIAG]

The above diagram is the
profile of the bank on the
Wangford side, where there
are generally 3 parallel banks.
The Elveden bank is an 
additional structure. Wangford 
does not have a warren 
bank at this point. The
Lakenheath bank is not 
altered at the Wangford -
-Elveden - Lakenheath triple
point. 

Typical section of the Laken-
heath bank on the S. side. 
[DIAG]

[4692-4693]
[DIAG]

[4694-4695]
The rectangular enclosures 
on Lakenheath Warren are 
bounded by very low but
substantial banks, difficult 
to make out on the ground
at this season except in 
areas of numerous pines
(which do not easily grow 
on the banks). 
Grasslands A-D are readily
distinguished. Nearly all the
Warren, apart from the most
acid areas and those with
bracken or gross disturbance,
are mosaics of the grassland
types, usually on stripes 
and polygons of which many 
families can be seen from 
the air.
