cont.

M Wood mainly of oak
and sycamore, without much
understorey.

N Belt containing many coni-
fers and other exotics.

O Rough grass on peat.
Many cowslips.
Rumex Acetosa common.
Listera frequent.
Endangered by young haw-
thorns.

P Much as O but les
rich. The two are separated
by an interesting hedge
[9078-9079]
a water-filled ditch.

Q. A mixed plantation, now
very tall and dense, with
abundant Pinus sylvestris,
and sycamore.
R. Rough grassland, not
very interesting but with a
few chalk plants such as
Cirsium acaule. Has three
notable trees:
1 & 2. Oaks. 1 has a crown
diameter of c. 100 ft but
is not very high; it has
massive horizontal branches.
Apparently young-middle-aged.
The base of the trunk has
a curious ledge about 1ft
high so that it is possible
to walk right round the trunk.
3. Elm with a ring of suck-
ers.

S. Plantation on firm dry
ground. Now mainly beech;
many oak stumps, appar-
ently wartime. Quite varied
and includes glades and
symphoricarpos thickets.

Three thunderstorms
happened beween 8 and
11.30 p.m. Red and yellow
flashes, close and violent
at times.
