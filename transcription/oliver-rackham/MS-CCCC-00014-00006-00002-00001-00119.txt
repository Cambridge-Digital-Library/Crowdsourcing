cont.

M Wood mainly of oak
and sycamore, without much
understorey.

N Belt containing many coni-
fers and other exotics.

O Rough grass on peat.
Many cowslips.
Rumex Acetosa common.
Listera frequent.
Endangered by young haw-
thorns.

P Much as O but les
rich. The two are separated
by an interesting hedge
[9078-9079]
a water-filled ditch.

Q. A mixed plantation, now
very tall and dense, with
abundant Pinus sylvestris,
and sycamore.
R. Rough grassland, not
very interesting but with a
few chalk plants such as
Cirsium acaule. Has three
notable trees:
1 & 2. Oaks. 1 has a crown
diameter of c. 100 ft but
is not very high; it has
massive horizontal branches.
Apparently young-middle-aged.
The base of the trunk has
a curious ledge about 1ft
high so that it is possible
to walk right round the trunk.
3. Elm with a ring of suck-
ers.

S. Plantation on firm dry
ground. Now mainly beech;
many oak stumps, appar-
ently wartime. Quite varied
and includes glades and
symphoricarpos thickets.

Three thunderstorms
happened beween 8 and
11.30 p.m. Red and yellow
flashes, close and violent
at times. Large soft
hail-stones. Very violent
rain.
May 28.
Rumex acetosa is abun-
[9080-9081]
dant in the long grass at
Leckhampton.
May 29.
One Heracleum plant
grows among the group of
conifers on the W. side of
Leckhammpton S. of the croquet
lawn.
May 30.
The young Lodoicea at
the Gardens is doing very
well and has produced a
fan leaf about 3ft high.
May 31.
The diseased horsechest-
nuts are not much de-
teriorated so far this year,
though the two most ser-
ious are late in coming into
leaf.
June 1.
The gourd seeds were
put in although they show
no sign of germinating yet.
June 2.
Broom is in flower on
the breck.
Ash leaves are not
quite out in the Norwich
area.
A fox was seen in a 
field near Stretham.
Some of the woodland
near Eccles-road station is
chestnut coppice.
June 3.
The Ipomaea seedlings
are coming up.

The elm area occupies
most but not all of the
earthworks. It is asso-
ciated with poor coppice,
but good coppice occurs in
areas inside the earth-
works where there is no
elm.
No ivy on ground in 
the old wood.
Ulmus glabra occurs
as a single large-coppice
stool inside the earthworks.
There are two patches
of Prunus spinosa scrub
N. of the earthworks.

THe [!!!!]track[!!!!] ditches round the
N. and W. sides of the
woods are somewhat myste-
rious; possibly an old drift
way, as suggested by the
trees growing on the banks
along part of its length.
THe ditch system is more
complex in its N. part be-
cause of the need to
take away the water from
the earthwork.
There was no standing
water in the wood, except
in the pond in the middle
of the four fields, and in
small parts of the N. range
of the earthworks.
June 4.
Hayley Wood (construction
jobs).
One of the large old
ash stools at the cross-
roads glade was de-
molished and a fragment
cut for dating coppice
cycles. Very narrow rings
at 1913-14; 1883-92; perhaps
before 1868.

There is still some
standing water in the
wood, but it has gone
down recently.
Oxlips have finished
flowering.
June 5.
12 of 13 Ipomoeas have
germinated and come through.
June 6.
[9098-9099]
Anthriscus in Leck-
hanpton is almost always
cut down by the gardeners,
but has remarkable powers
of producing new infls.
June 7.
The clematis opened
its first flower this year.
June 8.
Eccremocarpus is doing
very well: the red one
has been flowering contin-
uously since March, and
the orange one (after an
unexpected check when
the polythene sheeting was
removed) has now come
into flower.
June 9.
The largest Heracleum
mantegazzianum fell under
its own weight. only about
1/3 the stem circumference
was damaged, and it has
now been set up again
and staked.
The gourds have ger-
minated at last.
June 10.
Chippenham Fen (Natura-
lists' Trust and Joan WIlson).
Habitat recording was
tried. Difficulties arise
because of the complexity
and variety of vegetation.
The S.E. arm of Jerusa-
lem Wood is particularly
difficult. It contains many
planted exotics of about
100 years old, including Pinus
[9100-9101]
sylvestris; about half of this
sp. have survived. THere
are several large beech trees.
It is mostly on mineral
soil. There are various banks
probably artificial.
The open areas are
equally complex because of
mowing.
June 11.
Some Perpendicular tie
beams recently rejected in
repairs to Sawston church
roof have a span of 14ft
and measure 19 1/2" x 11" in the
middle. Advantage taken
of natural bend to produce
the camber. Very large
knots. Timber fairly open
grown (8 rings to the inch).
Aristolochia is flowering
at Whittlesford. Inflorescence
complex, flowers opening
in succession from the same
axil. Faint meaty smell.
[????]
A house in the main
street of WHittlesford, prob-
ably 17th or early 18th
cent., is built of oak
poles, probably thinnings. The
bark is left on. Worm has
not done much damage.
June 12.
Some gourds have been
transplanted and given
away to reduce the num-
ber.
June 13.
Some Ipomoeas have
[9102-9103]
been similarly treated.
June 14.
The new wisteria at 
Leckhampton is growing
well and has produced
a leading shoot several feet
long.
June 15.
Impatiens parviflora: about
a dozen plants grow in
flower-beds in the Tutor's
Garden in College.
June 16.
A remarkable plant grows
in the Master's courtyard, from
a Woolworth's bulb. [!!!!]Lea[!!!!]ves
like bluebells in shape, size,
and colour. Infl. about 6in.
high; rhacis green below,
the whole otherwise vivid
pale blue. A much-branched
panicle, branches divaricate,
rather thick. Minute scale
leaves. Flowers about
1 mm. diam. (too small to
see the structure), yellowish.
June 17.
Aphids are very abun-
dant on lime trees, which
drip black honey-dew onto
the ground.
June 18.
Ouse Washes (Frank
Perring).
The Washes are sub-
divided, most of the strips
being reached by an access
drift from Mepal along the 100
Foot. They are not all grazed
because of access difficulties.
[9104-9105]
Bird life [DIAG]
is very good, [DIAG]
including [DIAG]
mallard [DIAG]
and numer- [DIAG]
ous herons. [DIAG]
Snipe are [DIAG]
very abun- [DIAG]
dant. They [DIAG]
make a [DIAG]
noise quite
like the drumming of
woodpeckers but ess
harsh.
A frog was seen in
Wash 4.
Glyceria plicata ? was
seen in Wash 1. THe rhachis
of the newly-opened in-
florescence is bent in a
curious sinusoidal [DIAG]
way. [DIAG]
There appears [DIAG]
to be little flow [DIAG]
in the ditches, but [DIAG]
the plank barriers at
the N.W. ends of the 
cross ditches are all
forced over to the N.W.
[9106-9107]
suggesting some past cata-
strophe. These barriers pro-
vide crossing places. The wood
is quite sound where under water.

Access strip.
Subdivided by gates
at intervals and much
grazed. Short grass, not
very interesting.

Common Wash.
A large area sub-
divided by many shallow
extinct ditches. Grazed
by many cattle. Me-
dium tall grass with a
variet of taller plants e-
specially around the ditches.
No scrub.
Thalictrum is locally
abundant. A curious ring
of this plant was seen
some 12 yards in diameter,
with a hollow centre and
a matrix of Agrostis stolon-
ifera and occasional
Phalaris.
[DIAG]
Lysimachia nummularia
is frequent in the open.
Veronica catenata and
[9108-9109]
[SYMBOL]nanthe fistulosa were
seen.
Rumex crispus is the
commonest sp. and occurs
in irregular patches. One
straight line could perhaps
have some artificial origin.

Wash 1.
Grazed and has cattle
on it now. Short grass
with longer areas containing
Glecoma and tufts of
Deschampsia. Glyceria maxima
present but rare and
scattered.
Abundant birds including
a mallard's nest with 8
eggs.
Wash 2.
Not grazed for some
years. Differs from wash
1 little in its species list,
but is almost entirely
a nearly pure stand of
Glyceria maxima, the orig-
inal vegetation surviving
as small patches. Much
less varied and interesting,
and with less bird life. 
Woodland species:
Filipendula ulmaria
Galium palustre
Glechoma hederacea
Poa trivialis
Occasional hawthorns
occur but there is no ten-
dency for scrub to de-
velop.
[9110-9111]
The ditch between 2
and 1 is still and has
many aquatics, including
all four Lemnas, in the
following order of abundance:
L.minor - commmonest
L.polyrrhiza - recognized by size
L.gibba
L.trisulca - easily overlooked. [SYMBOL]

Wash 3.
Not grazed for a few years
and partly covered with Glyceria
maxima.

Wash 4.
Quite well maintained
and grazed. The ditch
between 3 and 4 rather
choked but unfordable.
In the S.E. section of
the [????]wash is a small
area of salix fragilis
woodland. Abundant
hawthorn understorey
and hawthorn scrub
adjoining. Stinging nettles
and bryony abundant.
Lythrum salicaria in
scrub adjoining.
Some of the hawthorn
bushes are small-leaved
this year and appear as
if droughted.

Washes 5 and 6.
Well maintained and
recently grazed. No trees,
but a few thorn bushes in
the S.E. sections.
[9112-9113]
OUSE WASHES.
Naturalists' Trust owns
compartments 1-7 and a
share in the common wash.
Plank barriers close
the ends of the
channels between
compartments and
provide crossings.
Those at the
N.W. ends are
damaged and
difficult to
use, or
else
miss-
ing.
[DIAG]
[9114-9115]
The Hundred Foot
is decidedly tidal. No
particular marginal plants.
The Old Bedford is
slow-flowing. Water plants
reduced by the River Board
but include abundant
Nymphoides.

June 19
Buff Wood.
[!!!!]June 19[!!!!] Drs Watt & Coombe
Helleborus is somewhat
suppressed; it is almost
exactly the same height as
the surrounding mercury.
One oxlip plant was
found still in flower in
the main oxlip area.
Occasional small ash
stools occur in the N.
part of the E. field, but
there is no proper coppice
large or small. No ivy.
Mercury is frequent
in the S. part of the "Thoro-
fare".
Death or disease of
mercury in wet hollows is
frequent.
Many of the horn-
beams (including most
of the standards) have
been severely barked at the
base, probably by hares.
They survive because the
bark in the deep flutings
is not reached.
Several cores were taken.
[9116-9117]
June 20.
June 21.
Aphids have been very
abundant recently and have
done considerable damage
to the Crassulaceae (Sedum
Telephium consumed to the
ground) and Heracleum mante-
gazzianum. All these were
sprayed with Derris solution.
June 22.
Dersingham (properly Sandring-
ham) Fen (Jim Dickson and
Robin Hill).
Teucrium is common in
the pine woods.
There is no sign of frost
damaging bracken in hollows
at Dersingham.
Campylopus introflexus
(174 4/15) is common under
heather.
[9118-9119]
Cryptothallus mirabilis.
Abundant where looked
for (and where previously
discovered) in hummocks
mostly Polytrichum com-
mune [!!!!]but[!!!!] mixed with some Sphag-
num recurvum, and Molinia.
Above the present water
level and at the base
of the still-uncompressed
Sphagnum. Some with young
sporangia.
Slight shade from very
light stunted birch scrub
dying at the top. Occasional
Rhododendron and small
pines. Juncus inflexus,
Erica tetralix, and Oxycoccos
frequent.
The leaf cells of Oxy-
coccos are visible with a
X 20.
Cladonia impexa (174 2/15)
frequently forms extensive
almost pine mats in the
upper part of the fen below
the Sphagnum compactum
zone.
Drosera anglica occurs
mainly in pools and D. rotun-
difolia on hummocks.
Frequently mixed and
sometimes hybridizing.

Cladonia macilenta? (174 3/15)
is frequent in bare patches
under heather: the only
common Cladonia other
than impexa.
[9120-9121]
[DIAG]
Schistostega. 174 1/15.
Holes in N. facing cliffs
near Wolferton station.
Cliffs artificial, formed by
railway cuttings in two
greensand ridges. THe upper
part is a vertical face up
to 25ft high. Rock very
soft sandstone, easily abraded
[DIAG]
with the fingers, pale greenish.
The plant occurs mainly
in large cavities about
3ft diam. and up to 12ft
deep, of unknown origin
but possibly sand-martin
holes enlarged by children
(very active at the foot
of these cliffs). Also in
sand-martin holes, which
[9122-9123]
run back for about 3ft
and end in a slightly en-
larged chamber, but are 
often shortened by erosion.
Schistostega is in great
abundance in the holes
which it inhabits (at least
15), lining the walls and
roof and running back
for some 10ft. It forms
a close carpet of plants
many of which are fer-
tile. The yellowish-green
glow is visible only on
areas without mature
plants, and is thus not
very prominent in some of
the caverns.
Distribution:
Cliff A (much the highest):
largest quantity of the plant.
B: no suitable holes.
C: cliff some 3ft high but
plant in at least 3 sand-
-martin holes.
D: several suitable holes
but none found.

These cliffs contain
fossil humus sheets, and
ironstone concretions, not
unlike the stone of N.Elm-
ham Minster.
A birch tree at the
top of the talus has
fallen over and the trunk
runs downhill for about
6ft before ending in an
apparently normal eret
trunk.
[9124-9125]
Hayley Wood (Nat. Trust
annnual perambulation)
Veronica Beccabunga is
frequent along the N.W.
main ride, which is still
very soft.
A group of about 10
Ophioglossums (some in fruit)
was seen in the west sec-
tion.
2 deer were seen at
a distance crossing the
pond ride - a hind and a
fawn.
Much of the glade is
becoming a turf of Poa tri-
vialis.
3 lesser-black-back
gulls were seen on the
fields S. of the wood.
Ch[SYMBOL]rophyllum temulum
occurs at the S.E. corner
of Hayley Lane.
Solanum Dulcamara oc-
curs in the S.E. pond.
Agropyrum caninum was
seen at the end of the S.E.
main ride.
Near the S.E. corner
of the wood, a pole maple
has recently fallen.
21 plants of Lithospermum
were counted in Hayley
Lane.
Plerotus sapidus occurs
in the E. section.
Open water is much 
reduced and Michael Martin's
pool is dry.
[9126-9127]
[DIAG]
[9128]
One hazel of about 4
years old was found near
the small  crab in the 
N.W. part of the 1967 plot.
A non-flowering plant of
Platanthera was found near-
by.
The Zone 1 areas on
the Pellia ride are soft but
have no standing water.
A disused cock-nest
was found in the Hut.
The pond is down by
about 6 in.
The scarlet [Scutellinia scut.] Ascomycete
(flat sessile cups with black
fringed margins) [!!!!]is frequent
on bonfire site[!!!!]was seen in the W. section.
Ranunculus flammula
occurs on New ride.
