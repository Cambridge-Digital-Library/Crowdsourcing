cont.

M Wood mainly of oak
and sycamore, without much
understorey.

N Belt containing many coni-
fers and other exotics.

O Rough grass on peat.
Many cowslips.
Rumex Acetosa common.
Listera frequent.
Endangered by young haw-
thorns.

P Much as O but les
rich. The two are separated
by an interesting hedge
[9078-9079]
a water-filled ditch.

Q. A mixed plantation, now
very tall and dense, with
abundant Pinus sylvestris,
and sycamore.
R. Rough grassland, not
very interesting but with a
few chalk plants such as
Cirsium acaule. Has three
notable trees:
1 & 2. Oaks. 1 has a crown
diameter of c. 100 ft but
is not very high; it has
massive horizontal branches.
Apparently young-middle-aged.
The base of the trunk has
a curious ledge about 1ft
high so that it is possible
to walk right round the trunk.
3. Elm with a ring of suck-
ers.

S. Plantation on firm dry
ground. Now mainly beech;
many oak stumps, appar-
ently wartime. Quite varied
and includes glades and
symphoricarpos thickets.

Three thunderstorms
happened beween 8 and
11.30 p.m. Red and yellow
flashes, close and violent
at times. Large soft
hail-stones. Very violent
rain.
May 28.
Rumex acetosa is abun-
[9080-9081]
dant in the long grass at
Leckhampton.
May 29.
One Heracleum plant
grows among the group of
conifers on the W. side of
Leckhammpton S. of the croquet
lawn.
May 30.
The young Lodoicea at
the Gardens is doing very
well and has produced a
fan leaf about 3ft high.
May 31.
The diseased horsechest-
nuts are not much de-
teriorated so far this year,
though the two most ser-
ious are late in coming into
leaf.
June 1.
The gourd seeds were
put in although they show
no sign of germinating yet.
June 2.
Broom is in flower on
the breck.
Ash leaves are not
quite out in the Norwich
area.
A fox was seen in a 
field near Stretham.
Some of the woodland
near Eccles-road station is
chestnut coppice.
June 3.
The Ipomaea seedlings
are coming up.

The elm area occupies
most but not all of the
earthworks. It is asso-
ciated with poor coppice,
but good coppice occurs in
areas inside the earth-
works where there is no
elm.
No ivy on ground in 
the old wood.
Ulmus glabra occurs
as a single large-coppice
stool inside the earthworks.
There are two patches
of Prunus spinosa scrub
N. of the earthworks.

THe [!!!!]track[!!!!] ditches round the
N. and W. sides of the
woods are somewhat myste-
rious; possibly an old drift
way, as suggested by the
trees growing on the banks
along part of its length.
THe ditch system is more
complex in its N. part be-
cause of the need to
take away the water from
the earthwork.
There was no standing
water in the wood, except
in the pond in the middle
of the four fields, and in
small parts of the N. range
of the earthworks.
June 4.
Hayley Wood (construction
jobs).
One of the large old
ash stools at the cross-
roads glade was de-
molished and a fragment
cut for dating coppice
cycles. Very narrow rings
at 1913-14; 1883-92; perhaps
before 1868.

There is still some
standing water in the
wood, but it has gone
down recently.
Oxlips have finished
flowering.
June 5.
12 of 13 Ipomoeas have
germinated and come through.
June 6.
[9098-9099]
Anthriscus in Leck-
hanpton is almost always
cut down by the gardeners,
but has remarkable powers
of producing new infls.
June 7.
The clematis opened
its first flower this year.
June 8.
Eccremocarpus is doing
very well: the red one
has been flowering contin-
uously since March, and
the orange one (after an
unexpected check when
the polythene sheeting was
removed) has now come
into flower.
June 9.
The largest Heracleum
mantegazzianum fell under
its own weight. only about
1/3 the stem circumference
was damaged, and it has
now been set up again
and staked.
The gourds have ger-
minated at last.
June 10.
Chippenham Fen (Natura-
lists' Trust and Joan WIlson).
Habitat recording was
tried. Difficulties arise
because of the complexity
and variety of vegetation.
The S.E. arm of Jerusa-
lem Wood is particularly
difficult. It contains many
planted exotics of about
100 years old, including Pinus
