very narrow and almost blocked
by bushes through which a 
car must force its way.  Part
is an earth road across fields
which the adjoining farmer
tried to block some time ago.

  Corn in the Fens has
not begun to be reaped. The
barley is very tangled. Some
of the wheat is badly lodged
also. Most wheat still has
some green in the stalks. On
one field the pattern of drains
stands out as bands of mis-
lodged wheat.
  There is a great deal of Pen-
dumium in Scots Pine along
the Brandon-Thetford railway.
  Rosebay is very abundant in
the S. part of E. Wretham Heath.
  About half the corn on the
