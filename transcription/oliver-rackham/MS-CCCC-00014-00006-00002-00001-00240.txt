4 August
  There is a fine smallleaved
lime in Toft churchyard - ap-
parently not a pollard. With
hybrid limes.
  The first barley being cut
at Toft and to the N. of
Kingston Wood - straw burning
in the latter.

DED. No particular increase
on the way to Hayley Wood. In
the W. end of Longstowe there has
been little fresh attack since
last year.

a third if the crown, mainly
at the base, came into leaf this
year: it remained in leaf with
leaves rather smnaller than us-

Some slight develooment of new
symptoms in a few twigs. Tree

6 August.
  The droughted beech-tree

11 August.
  The Cam is evidently severely
polluted. Along Grantchester
8583
Meadows there appears to be 
no living submerged vegetation -
all the plants that arose in the
spring are dead. Swimming is
officially discouraged and there 
is some public protest.

   Sniveller's Lane, past the

is a decayed road. Part of it
is tarred by the county council
many years ago but it is
very narrow and almost blocked
by bushes through which a 
car must force its way.  Part

tried to block some time ago.

  Corn in the Fens has
not begun to be reaped. The
barley is very tangled. Some
of the wheat is badly lodged
also. Most wheat still has
some green in the stalks. On
one field the pattern of drains
stands out as bands of mis-
lodged wheat.
  There is a great deal of Pen-
dumium in Scots Pine along
the Brandon-Thetford railway.
  Rosebay is very abundant in
the S. part of E. Wretham Heath.
  About half the corn on the

  A powerful vortex was seen

from c. 300 yds away. Shape
of an inverted cone, angle about
30o. Base c. 10 ft dia. Sucking
up straw, both individual straws
and wads of straw up to c. 1 ft
across.  Moved over the field at
about 1 m.p.h. Extended up-
wards for about 100 ft, becoming 
less dense. After about 20 sec
it moved eastwards left the
field and suddenly became
weaker. Persisted for about 10
min. As it moved over the 
road the ground-level wind be-
came imperceptible. Two light
aircraft at this stage flew through
the column, by then some 800
ft high, withiout being deflected.
Shortly afterwards the content
began falling rapidly.

  Wych-elms mostly large spread-

  Beeches frequent, large, usually

  Between Blair Athill % Struan Sta

  Dalnordoch Lodge is another

  Dalnaspidal is one farm,

  Small snow-patch in a cornic

Birches & oaks along the Truim
begin at about 1100 ft.

extensive wood-pastures with
large widely-spaced birch.  Birches
all pubescens in some places, pen-

Similar birches very extensive on
slopes around Newtonmore-on-Spey.
  Two barley fields st Newton-

  Extensive meadows at Newton-

  Ruthven Barracks is a large
stone-built ruin.
  The Cairngorms appear to be 
free of snow.  Top of Braeriach
not quite visible. - no, some small
snow-patches on N-facing hollows.
  Between Kingussie & Aviemore
the land is extensively covererd
with pine plantations, mostly not
fullgrown.  Native woods are of
birch, and very variable: wood-
-pastures with scattered old birch,
dense younger stands, heather
8615
and bracken being invaded, uneven-
-aged birch on very steep slopes.
Old pines occasional; no certain
native pines seen. dense stand
of oaks in one place.
  This year there has been a
small fire in youngish birch
near Alrie and another of about
100 ac. A c.6-y-o pne N. of
Aviemore.
Woods between Aviemore & Caw-
bridge.
  Mostly pine plantations. Very
varying age - usually in evenaged
panels. Some of the older ones
are neglected, with big gaps and
varying degrees of regeneration &
of invasion by birch.
  On the W. of the railway
[18616-18617]
8616
in the valley of the Feith Mhor
and on the hills to the W., exte-
ding slightly E. of the railway, is
a very extensive stand of scat-
tered old pines. Variable in
habit, often flat-topped, branching
from near the base often at a
narrow angle. These pines are
evidently the remains of a
denser stand. More than half
of them are dead. some very 
large ones.
  The stand is cut through
by enormous & carelessly-sited
roadworks, and has bden badly
damaged. Also extensively
underplanted with pine (as well
as natural regeneration). At
least 100 acres have been
burnt this year - the younger-
8617
trees killed altogether, the older
ones sometimes still living in
part of their crowns.
  Trees generally in heather: some are in
shallow blanket-peat.
  1 in 92 up to the Spey-Findhorn
Pass - the Drumochter Pass is
probably steeper, 1 in 80, 1 in 70, though the terrain
is less rugged. The two are of
about equal altitudes. The
Spey-Findhorn traverses a pair
of small steep-sided valleys,
notched into broad flat-topt
plateau.

Extensive old open birch
wood-pasture around Tomatin.
1 in 60 descent at tomatin.

On an island in Loch Moy is an

  Beeches grow very well
around Culloden & Inverness.
Large spreading trees, some
old [????] dying back.
  E. of Inverness the land is
highly cultivated. Much barley,
about 2/3 of it reaped. Rest is
improved grassland. Rather small
square fields with straight hedges
which are either gappy or overgrown.
Hedgerow trees many & large,
chiefly oak, beech, ash. Ash does
better as a hedge tree than in the
Midlands. Much the same country
over the Moray Firth.

The railway S of Inverness
is mostly single-track. Over the
8619
Drumochter Pass the track is
being doubled, apparently on its
original bed, but most of the
track-bed is too narrow.

  A heron in a rotting wreck by
the Caledonian Canal swingbridge.
  Ash & wych-elm are common
in scrub by the railway W. of In-
verness. Some verry large wych-elm
trees in pastures: rather spreading
habit, height c. 1 1/2 x dia.: crowns
thin, but no sign of disease.
  Kirkhill by Beauly could 
almost be Norfolk: barley fields,
pastures, scruffy thorn hedges with
fine oaks & ashes.
  Alder-carr at Beauly of rather
sparse big 1-stemmed trees, many
of them dying-back and heavily

  Magnificent tall beeches around

Country in Strathpeffer is simi-

pasture: much barley on S-facing
slopes: hedges of ash or thorn, many
big oaks (?all Q. robur). Gallery
woodland along streams. Along
railway scrub of ash, elm, syca-
more, which is evidently coppiced.
  Hazel in scrub near Fodderty-
prob. abundant in gallery woods.
  Much rather dense birchwood

Much new plantation.

Coille Creag-Loch. Wood on a
very steep S.W -facing slope. with
much cliff and scree.  Pines dom-

   Magnificent scenery. The Apple-
 cross Hills are a plateau dissected
 on its E. side by a series of
 corries quite as fine as any in the 
 Alps, with precipitous sides and
 heads of black shiny rocks rising in
 cliff upon cliff. Prodigious screes in
 some corries.
   A rowan-tree was found on
 the middle of a big mossy boulder

small closed stands. Mostly sur-
rounded by modern plantations.

Beian Eighe. Very steep mountain

Remains of infield on patch of
mineral soil. Quite modern iron
plow.

Loch Achanalt.
  Shallow loch with a curious
delta, a pair of levees known 
as the Tiger's Tail.
  Level fluctuates considrably.
There is a tide-line of debris
about 4 ft above the present
level; this is due to spates on the
river,there being a fall down to
Loch a'Chullin.
  Furze and broom are both
very rare in Westar Ross. Chiefly
on and around the railway
tract - imported ballast?

Calluna-Molinia on slopes,
[18638-18639]

tending to pure Molinia in
steeper ploaces,
Bracken mainly at low altitudes
and on rock outcrops and broken
slopes; it is generally rather rare
in the whole district.
  Some slopes of at least 20o
are a mosaic of Calluna &
Trichophorum - the Calluna
sometimes perpetuates what seem
to be the terracets of cattle gra-
zing.

 Several wooden bridges
on the Carron, usually with nu-
merous trestles.

  On the S.E. side of Strath
Carron there are extensive partly
continuous birchwoods on the
8639
steep slopes of Carn Mor.

plain and on the lower hillsides
are chiefly oak.

 Myrica is abundant in
bogs around Achanallt and
towards Strathcarron buyt ap-
pears to be absent around the
watershed.

  Loch Carron Salt marshes.
  Much sheep-grazing - turf
mainly close-cropped.
