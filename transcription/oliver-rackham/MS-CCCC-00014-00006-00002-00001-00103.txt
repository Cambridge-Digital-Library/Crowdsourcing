July 9.
A rabbit was seen about
10 a.m. quietly eating grass
around the Henry Moore statue
in Leckhampton.
July 10.
Fox-hole Heath (Part II class).
Stone-curlews were heard.
Malia moschata occurs on
the warren hill.
Melilotus officinalis is
abundant on an abandoned
field across the road from
the Heath.
Sisymbrium Sophia and
Onopordon are frequent in
the same field. Anthoxan-
thum and Dactylis are
dominant.
From time to time an

[8134-8135]

Iron Duke empties the
contents of cess-pits in
patches on this breck.
All vegetaion is killed by
the deposit and the site
remains bare for a con-
siderable time. Dactylis is
the plant least affected,
and is dominant in a 
zone round the margins,
where it grows very tall and
deep blue-green in contrast
to the sparse pale stand
in the rest of the field.
The middle of the area
may be invaded slowly by
Dactylis, or may become a
nearly pure stand of Lamium
album (not otherwise pre-
sent on the field). Silene
dioica is rather resistant
and occasional plants may
flourish just on the inside
of the Dactylis ring. Nettles
come in very slowly.
July 12.
Gamlingay.
Wet Meadow (Nat. Trust).
The meadow is formed
by a tongue of Ampthill
Clay in the bottom of a
valley in Lower Greensand.
Although only 2 1/2 acres,
it is remarkably varied.
The chief plant communities
are dominated by Lotus
uliginosus and Juncus
effusus. Lotus grows up
to 2ft high in almost
pure stands. Juncus also

[8136-8137]

forms pure stands, much
flattened by recent storms.
A recently-burnt area
by the edge of Great Heath
Wood has abundant growth
of Juncus bufonius, [????]. bulbosus,
and Isolepis setacea.
Quercus cerris seedlings
are abundant.
Hydrocotyle and Carex
ovalis are frequent.
Arctium Lappa occurs.
Sphagnum was found
recently by Dr Perring
under Juncus; but it could
not be seen today, probably
because the rushes were too
much lodged.
Calluna is said to
grow among grass, but was
not seen.
A reedy pool adjoining is
fringed with tall irises.
The Great Heath Wood is
mainly Q. Cerris, with
much birch and Castanea.
Spergula is abundant
in fields around the Great
Heath Wood.

July 13.
Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus
continues to flourish in the
rough grass at Leckhampton.
July 14.
Sempervivum montanum
(Mutterbergerthal) is flowering.
[SYMBOL]
July 15.
Spinney between Jaggard's Farm
and Common Farm, Comberton,
389584.
From its situation, it
would seem to be of inclosure
date.
Trees: Hornbeam from
old stools, dom.
Beech: scattered, some
also old copppice.
Oak: few. Some young.
Elm: few, scattered.
Hawthorn: old hedges
along Whitwell Way, a few
other bushes.
Ground flora: mainly ivy.
Brachypodium sylvaticum
and Tamus scattered.
Spinney, Hardwick, on the
parish boundary by the bend
in the P[????]t Way. 382582.
Ash: dom. but very open.
Oak: few, rather young.
Hornbeam: co-dom.
Tree canopy rather thin and
broken. Beech: few.
Crataegus monogyna: scat-
tered, not forming a shrub
layer. No coppice.
Daphne laureola: freq.

[8140-8141]

Rubus caesius.
Ligustrum: local, thin and
low.
Ivy: abundant, cover by
no means complete.
Ta[????].
Galium aparine: ab. NOt
nettles.
Arum.
Sanicle: local.
Brachypodium sylvaticum: loc.
Carex sylvatica: loc.
Viola sp.
Geranium robert.
Anthriscus: rare.
Toft Plantation, Hardwick.
Not visited.
Oak
Populus canescens or alba
P. canadensis
Maple
Ash
Cornus abundant
Hardwick Wood (new part).
This is an obvious recent
wood. The dominant trees
are mainly oaks, often with
pioneer habit. Large areas
are still in the scrub
stage, very dense and
sometimes quite impenetrable
(like a hedge in three
dimensions).
Oak. Some large; many
medium and small. No
sign of an even-aged stand
as in Hayley; the big oaks
often have a pioneer habit.

[8142-8143]

Suggesting gradual colonization.
Birch. Locally dominant, espe-
cially along the E. side.
Populus canadensis. Frequent.
Sycamore. Loc. ab.
Ash. Occasional big trees. No
large number of seedlings.
Larch. Few; the only direct
evidence of planting.
Maple. None seen.
Ulmus glabra. Frequent: a
big group in the E. corner;
[!!!!]t much suckering.
Crataegus mon[!!!!]yna. Few
old trees; a minor constituent
of scrub.
Prunus spinosa. Dense dark
thickets in much of the
area, especially the middle
third.
Honeysuckle. Locally v. ab.
Hazel. Not common.
Ground communities.
1. Bare ground: under im-
penetrable Prunus or very
shady hawthorn. Occupie
a large area in the
northern half.
2. Glechome. Mainly in the
N. half, under moderate to
dense shade.
3. Tall herbs. Angelica, Cir-
sium palustre, [????] : in N.
half, where there are big
patches free of shrubs and
with little shade from trees.
4. Tall grasses. Bromus erectus,
Poa nemoralis, Brachypodium
sylvaticum; herbs such as
Hypericum hirsutum and
Angelica are less abundant;

[8144-8145]

mercury occurs at low density.
This community covers a con-
siderable area of the E.
side, formerly adjoining Toft
Plantation, with no bushes
and relatively scattered trees.
All along the N.E. side
is a large extinct badger
sett. Rabbits live in a few
of the holes and in many
places under very dense
scrub, though numbers are
probably small.
The standard woodland
communities (mercury and
marginal bluebell) are de-
veloped locally.
History of the belt shown
[DIAG]
on the 1835 map, only

[8146-8147]

the "pan-handle" of the
old wood seems to survive.
The grassland known
to have existed in 1922
coincides with an area#
of scrub with bare ground,
though mercury appears
to have successfully in-
vaded from the S.W.
The 1922 woodland seems
now to be less mature
than the 1922 scrub, although
it contains several oak and
elm trees which must be
much older.
The fate of Toft Plan-
tation shows the contin-
uing ready interconversion
of farmland and scrub.
Hardwick Old Wood.
The map is likely to
be inaccurate as owing
to very bad weather and
light and the absence of
a compass it was difficult
to avoid going round in circles
in the interior of the wood.
Oak. Dominant over most of
the wood. Standards of
low density, many large.
[!!!!]New[!!!!]Few stumps seen. Two
pole-sized trees.
Ash. Scarce: only a few
old coppice stools and stan-
dards.
Maple. Scarce: a few big trees.
