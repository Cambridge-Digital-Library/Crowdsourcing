[DIAG]
July 9.
A rabbit was seen about
10 a.m. quietly eating grass
around the Henry Moore statue
in Leckhampton.
July 10.
Fox-hole Heath (Part II class).
Stone-curlews were heard.
Malia moschata occurs on
the warren hill.
Melilotus officinalis is
abundant on an abandoned
field across the road from
the Heath.
Sisymbrium Sophia and
Onopordon are frequent in
the same field. Anthoxan-
thum and Dactylis are
dominant.
From time to time an

[8134-8135]

Iron Duke empties the
contents of cess-pits in
patches on this breck.
All vegetaion is killed by
the deposit and the site
remains bare for a con-
siderable time. Dactylis is
the plant least affected,
and is dominant in a 
zone round the margins,
where it grows very tall and
deep blue-green in contrast
to the sparse pale stand
in the rest of the field.
The middle of the area
may be invaded slowly by
Dactylis, or may become a
nearly pure stand of Lamium
album (not otherwise pre-
sent on the field). Silene
dioica is rather resistant
and occasional plants may
flourish just on the inside
of the Dactylis ring. Nettles
come in very slowly.
July 12.
Gamlingay.
Wet Meadow (Nat. Trust).
The meadow is formed
by a tongue of Ampthill
Clay in the bottom of a
valley in Lower Greensand.
Although only 2 1/2 acres,
it is remarkably varied.
The chief plant communities
are dominated by Lotus
uliginosus and Juncus
effusus. Lotus grows up
to 2ft high in almost
pure stands. Juncus also

[8136-8137]

forms pure stands, much
flattened by recent storms.
A recently-burnt area
by the edge of Great Heath
Wood has abundant growth
of Juncus bufonius, [????]. bulbosus,
and Isolepis setacea.
Quercus cerris seedlings
are abundant.
Hydrocotyle and Carex
ovalis are frequent.
Arctium Lappa occurs.
Sphagnum was found
recently by Dr Perring
under Juncus; but it could
not be seen today, probably
because the rushes were too
much lodged.
Calluna is said to
grow among grass, but was
not seen.
A reedy pool adjoining is
fringed with tall irises.
The Great Heath Wood is
mainly Q. Cerris, with
much birch and Castanea.
Spergula is abundant
in fields around the Great
Heath Wood.

July 13.
Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus
continues to flourish in the
rough grass at Leckhampton.
July 14.
Sempervivum montanum
(Mutterbergerthal) is flowering.
[SYMBOL]
July 15.
Spinney between Jaggard's Farm
and Common Farm, Comberton,
389584.
From its situation, it
would seem to be of inclosure
date.
Trees: Hornbeam from
old stools, dom.
Beech: scattered, some
also old copppice.
Oak: few. Some young.
Elm: few, scattered.
Hawthorn: old hedges
along Whitwell Way, a few
other bushes.
Ground flora: mainly ivy.
Brachypodium sylvaticum
and Tamus scattered.
Spinney, Hardwick, on the
parish boundary by the bend
in the P[????]t Way. 382582.
Ash: dom. but very open.
Oak: few, rather young.
Hornbeam: co-dom.
Tree canopy rather thin and
broken. Beech: few.
Crataegus monogyna: scat-
tered, not forming a shrub
layer. No coppice.
Daphne laureola: freq.

[8140-8141]

Rubus caesius.
Ligustrum: local, thin and
low.

Cornus abundant
Hardwick Wood (new part).
This is an obvious recent
wood. The dominant trees
are mainly oaks, often with
pioneer habit. Large areas
are still in the scrub
stage, very dense and
sometimes quite impenetrable
(like a hedge in three
dimensions).
Oak. Some large; many
medium and small. No
sign of an even-aged stand
as in Hayley; the big oaks
often have a pioneer habit.

[8142-8143]

Suggesting gradual colonization.
Birch. Locally dominant, espe-
cially along the E. side.
Populus canadensis. Frequent.
Sycamore. Loc. ab.
Ash. Occasional big trees. No
large number of seedlings.
Larch. Few; the only direct
evidence of planting.
Maple. None seen.
Ulmus glabra. Frequent: a
big group in the E. corner;
[!!!!]t much suckering.
Crataegus mon[!!!!]yna. Few
old trees; a minor constituent
of scrub.
Prunus spinosa. Dense dark
thickets in much of the
area, especially the middle
third.
Honeysuckle. Locally v. ab.
Hazel. Not common.
Ground communities.
1. Bare ground: under im-
penetrable Prunus or very
shady hawthorn. Occupie
a large area in the
northern half.
2. Glechome. Mainly in the
N. half, under moderate to
dense shade.
3. Tall herbs. Angelica, Cir-
sium palustre, [????] : in N.
half, where there are big
patches free of shrubs and
with little shade from trees.
4. Tall grasses. Bromus erectus,
Poa nemoralis, Brachypodium
sylvaticum; herbs such as
Hypericum hirsutum and
Angelica are less abundant;

[8144-8145]

mercury occurs at low density.
This community covers a con-
siderable area of the E.
side, formerly adjoining Toft
Plantation, with no bushes
and relatively scattered trees.
All along the N.E. side
is a large extinct badger
sett. Rabbits live in a few
of the holes and in many
places under very dense
scrub, though numbers are
probably small.
The standard woodland
communities (mercury and
marginal bluebell) are de-
veloped locally.
History of the belt shown
[DIAG]
on the 1835 map, only

[8146-8147]

the "pan-handle" of the
old wood seems to survive.
The grassland known
to have existed in 1922
coincides with an area#
of scrub with bare ground,
though mercury appears
to have successfully in-
vaded from the S.W.
The 1922 woodland seems
now to be less mature
than the 1922 scrub, although
it contains several oak and
elm trees which must be
much older.
The fate of Toft Plan-
tation shows the contin-
uing ready interconversion
of farmland and scrub.
Hardwick Old Wood.
The map is likely to
be inaccurate as owing
to very bad weather and
light and the absence of
a compass it was difficult
to avoid going round in circles
in the interior of the wood.
Oak. Dominant over most of
the wood. Standards of
low density, many large.
[!!!!]New[!!!!]Few stumps seen. Two
pole-sized trees.
Ash. Scarce: only a few
old coppice stools and stan-
dards.
Maple. Scarce: a few big trees.

[8148-8149]

Elm. A large area near the
W. side of the wood; patches
elsewhere. Spreads by suckers.
Prob. U. Plotii.
Hawthorn. Marginal C. monogyna
only. Cor[????], Viburnum, [????]. are
all marginal.
Hazel. Much more dominant
than in any other wood
yet visited, except parts of
Kingston. Probably cut since
the war. Forms a dense
uniform dark canopy, much
as at Eversden. Other shrubs
scarce or absent.
Ground flora. Much resembles
Buff Wood. Three oxlip
areas; hybrids frequent.
Ivy occurs everywhere
on the E. side of the
wood, but not outside this
[????] except marginally. Remarkable apparently
complete absence of Filipendula.
Cover rather thin, like [!!!!]Kings[!!!!]ton. Ash
not regenerating.
Elm is dominant over
the areas where it occurs,
but less completely so and
more widely spaced than in
Hayley. In some areas it is
co-dominant with ash and
oak. Probably uneven-aged.
[ursinum]
Allium vineale occurs in
some abundance among mercury
at the far end of the
pan-handle.
Epipactis (presumably
E. Helleborine) occurs at one
place in the very middle
of the wood.

[8150-8151]

Oxlip occurs in the general wood.
Rides are too indistinct for it to be
a characteristic ride plant (of Kingston).
Much hybridization with primrose.
Cracks in the ground
are still open in places de-
spite heavy rain.
There is no surface
water, and the ground
is fairly dry. There is a
small permanent pool
in a depression with a ditch
leading to it, of unknown
purpose, near the middle
of the wood.
The marginal browning
of mercury leaves was seen
a few yards in from
the wood on the W. side,
in a site which would
probably get the afternoon
sun for a short time.

[8152-8153]

1. Polyporus dryadeus. On
an oak which had coppiced
and then died.
2. Ganoderma lucidum. Ibid.

[Original field notes of this
survey are with the Hayley
Wood records]
July 16.
Numerous in small t[????]
on the Old Court grass, and
frequent in the New Court.
Appearing after heavy rain,
and very rapidly deliquescing
(even in a refrigerator). 1[????]-
1 1/4 - 3/64.
P. ovoid, then campan-
ulate, never expanding, buff
at first, then pale gray except
in the middle, matt, finely
sulcate, when young with
coarse dirty-white granules.
S. cyclindric, very tender,
shining white.
L. free, narrow, black.
C. odourless.
Coprinus
[!!!!] nycthemerus.
Almost certain.

July 15 [cont.]
Differences between Hardwick &
Hayley.

[8156-8157]

1. Fewer oaks. Very few
stumps, much decayed, with
no dead wood.
2. Other standars very scarce.
Very few old ash stools, or
maple. Poplar almost absent.
3. Very dense, rather recently
coppiced, well-managed, almost
pure hazel stand.
4. Hawthorn scarce and prob-
ably all C. monogyna.
5. Much smaller wet areas.
No Zone 1.
6. No Filipendula; most
other ground species of
Zones 2 & 3 poorly represented.
7. Much primrose in the
intermediate zones.
8. Much terrestrial ivy.

Hayley Wood.
Coppicing, perambulation, and
survey for meteorological stations
A & B. With Joan Wilson.
Most of the coppice
timber was carted and
stacked near the main ride.
1966 plot.
Much of the ground
vegetation has now recovered
from disturbance during
coppicing.
Ash regeneration is
rather poor, deer having
eaten many of the shoots.
Exceptions are two stools
against which poles had
been stacked. The ash shoots

[8158-8159]

were protected by the poles
and have now got away up
to 6ft high. [SYMBOL]
1965 plot.
Only a few ash stools have
grown up out of reach of
deer; these are mostly
high stools cut off about
3ft above ground, so that
the ash had a shorter
distance to cover.
Vegetation is rather
luxuriant but less so than
in the 1964 plot. This ap-
plies particularly to Fili-
pendula and Cirsium
palustre, where there is no
great difference in density
but plants in the 1964
plot are about [!!!!] twice as
tall.
Ranunculus flamm[!!!!]la
and Lysimachia are flourishing
in a dried-out linear "black
hole".
Sonchus asper and [????]-
ceus occur.
1964 plot.
Hazel is now up to
7 ft high. Some maple
has got away but little ash.
Cirsium palustre and
Filipendula are now dominant,
the former up to 9ft high. [SYMBOL].
A fine dragonfly was
seen hawking insects
rather lethargically in the
main ride by the coppice
plots. [SYMBOL].
The marginal flora on

[8160-8161]

the W. side includes Carduus
crispus and Dipsacus fullonum.
Marginal browning of
mercury was seen on the
W. side; rather slight, often
only at the ends of teeth;
always within 10 yards of
the edge of the wood and
in view of the afternoon sun.
There is very little
Callitriche in the pond.
1. Coprinus micaceus. Occasional
on rotten wood.
2. C. disseminatus. A large
group on an ash stool, S.
section. [SYMBOL].
3. C. comatus. Recent bonfire
in the Glade.
4. Peziza umbrina. Ibid. and
in the 1966 coppice on bonfire.
5. Polyporus squamosus. On ash.

July 18
Ipomoea is producing some
flower-buds.
July 19.
Both sets of Eccremocarpos
are continuing to flower abun-
dantly.
July 20. See p. 8187. July 21. With
Cornflowers at Conington. [SYMBOL]
In a barley field on
C[????]allian. The second field
on the S.W. side of the
Huntingdon road before the
Conington turn. Centre of
field 338 668.
The plants are slightly
taller than the barley.
They number many thou-
sand. The greatest concen-
tration is in the middle
of the field, but some
grow up to the roadside,
and specimens were taken
from here. [SYMBOL] [SYMBOL].
Elsworth Wood. With [SYMBOL].
The two limbs of this
wood are completely different
and must be taken separ-
ately.
The W. limb (now much
reduced by clearing) is a
valley-slope wood like
Overhall Grove, mainly Ulmus
glabra. It contains however
an area of dense scrub.
The E. limb is a ridge
wood of old coppice with
standards, showing con-
siderable signs of disturbance.

[8164]

The hedges around
the W. side of the wood
are mostly decayed or
removed, but many notable
overgrown pollard elms
(U. carpinifolia) with burred
trunks remain.
The central meadow
occupies a slight rolling
ridge with a stream on
the E. side but not on
the W. It seems to
have been re-sown and
contains little of interest.
There is an enormous 3-
trunked oak and a big
horse-chestnut.
