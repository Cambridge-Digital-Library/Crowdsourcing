July 9.
A rabbit was seen about
10 a.m. quietly eating grass
around the Henry Moore statue
in Leckhampton.
July 10.
Fox-hole Heath (Part II class).
Stone-curlews were heard.
Malia moschata occurs on
the warren hill.
Melilotus officinalis is
abundant on an abandoned
field across the road from
the Heath.
Sisymbrium Sophia and
Onopordon are frequent in
the same field. Anthoxan-
thum and Dactylis are
dominant.

Iron Duke empties the
contents of cess-pits in
patches on this breck.
All vegetaion is killed by
the deposit and the site
remains bare for a con-
siderable time. Dactylis is
the plant least affected,
and is dominant in a 
zone round the margins,
where it grows very tall and
deep blue-green in contrast
to the sparse pale stand
in the rest of the field.
The middle of the area
may be invaded slowly by
Dactylis, or may become a
nearly pure stand of Lamium
album (not otherwise pre-
sent on the field). Silene
dioica is rather resistant
and occasional plants may
flourish just on the inside
of the Dactylis ring. Nettles
come in very slowly.

Gamlingay.
Wet Meadow (Nat. Trust).
The meadow is formed
by a tongue of Ampthill
Clay in the bottom of a
valley in Lower Greensand.
Although only 2 1/2 acres,
it is remarkably varied.
The chief plant communities
are dominated by Lotus
uliginosus and Juncus
effusus. Lotus grows up
to 2ft high in almost
pure stands. Juncus also
