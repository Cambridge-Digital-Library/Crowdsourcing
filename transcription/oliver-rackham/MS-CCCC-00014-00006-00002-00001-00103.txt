July 9.
A rabbit was seen about
10 a.m. quietly eating grass
around the Henry Moore statue
in Leckhampton.
July 10.
Fox-hole Heath (Part II class).
Stone-curlews were heard.
Malia moschata occurs on
the warren hill.
Melilotus officinalis is
abundant on an abandoned
field across the road from
the Heath.
Sisymbrium Sophia and
Onopordon are frequent in
the same field. Anthoxan-
thum and Dactylis are
dominant.
From time to time an

[8134-8135]

Iron Duke empties the
contents of cess-pits in
patches on this breck.
All vegetaion is killed by
the deposit and the site
remains bare for a con-
siderable time. Dactylis is
the plant least affected,
and is dominant in a 
zone round the margins,
where it grows very tall and
deep blue-green in contrast
to the sparse pale stand
in the rest of the field.
The middle of the area
may be invaded slowly by
Dactylis, or may become a
nearly pure stand of Lamium
album (not otherwise pre-
sent on the field). Silene
dioica is rather resistant
and occasional plants may
flourish just on the inside
of the Dactylis ring. Nettles
come in very slowly.
July 12.
Gamlingay.
Wet Meadow (Nat. Trust).
The meadow is formed
by a tongue of Ampthill
Clay in the bottom of a
valley in Lower Greensand.
Although only 2 1/2 acres,
it is remarkably varied.
The chief plant communities
are dominated by Lotus
uliginosus and Juncus
effusus. Lotus grows up
to 2ft high in almost
pure stands. Juncus also

[8136-8137]

forms pure stands, much
flattened by recent storms.
A recently-burnt area
by the edge of Great Heath
Wood has abundant growth
of Juncus bufonius, [????]. bulbosus,
and Isolepis setacea.
Quercus cerris seedlings
are abundant.
Hydrocotyle and Carex
ovalis are frequent.
Arctium Lappa occurs.
Sphagnum was found
recently by Dr Perring
under Juncus; but it could
not be seen today, probably
because the rushes were too
much lodged.
Calluna is said to
grow among grass, but was
not seen.
A reedy pool adjoining is
fringed with tall irises.
The Great Heath Wood is
mainly Q. Cerris, with
much birch and Castanea.
Spergula is abundant
in fields around the Great
Heath Wood.

Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus
continues to flourish in the
rough grass at Leckhampton.

Sempervivum montanum
(Mutterbergerthal) is flowering.
