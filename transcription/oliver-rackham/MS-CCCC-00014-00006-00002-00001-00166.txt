   The mountain is a skew 3-

cliffs toweards Trojeralmital. The
rocks are much shattered, espe-
cially on the S.E. ridge, but
completely lichenized.  Higher
plants grow right to the top.

   Also a very distant mountain
with large snow areas above
the saddle N. of Hochgrabe (Defer-
eggen A).  Either Triglav or some-
thing in the Carmic Alps.
   Summit warm and conducive 
to sleep.

   Mountains of micaceous schist
with numerous large quarzite

   Summit rocks - where not
broken by careless visitors -
almost completely lichenized,
and covered about half with
leafy & shrubby forms.
   The summit rocks are 
much shattered, though not 
recently unless by visitors, and
there are fine pinnacles on the
S.E. ridge (cf Hochtourist instructions!)

These meadows are probably
very rich in species, though
none is now flowering.  There
are small Trichophorium flushes.
They must have been much
mowed at one time, but are
now largely neglected (because
of depopulation).  There is some

sheep grazing at Fieldzalin,
where there used to be horned
cattle;  the old Almhutte is in
ruins and a small new hut
has been built.  Most of the
huts shown on the map
have disappeared. There is
not much invasion by trees,
though the area lies well below
the upper limit of forest at
c. 2150 m.  There are occasional
spruce & larch making very slow
growth.
Innerberg Woods.
   Rather dull.  Dense spruce
with a small proportion of
larch increasing upwards.  Cut
in sections, but mainly mature.
2567
Upper edge well-defined.
No Zirm at all except a few
trees at the upper margin.
Ladfratter says that this is
because of the soil*, but possibly
the mining is involved.
   The Lasorling range is
mainly grassland and scree;  very
little forest oe even Latschen.
   The snow-line is at least
3200m on S. facing slopes.
   Oberrseitsee is a deep lake
with shore mainly of boulders.
No aquatic vegetation or fens.
The slpoes above the lake
are mainly slabby brittle rocks
or very large loose boulders.
*Too wet & acid.

[12568-12569]

   The much higher Alples
lakes ([SYMBOL] 6) are in shallow glacial
depressions.  Free of ice but
without evident plant life.

September 26
   Between St Jakob and Lacken
is a tract of river gravels with
scrub, grassland, and young
forest.  It was relatively little
altered by the 1966 floods.  The
scrub is of mainly mature or
over-mature Myricaria bushes
([SYMBOL]19) and Salix purpurea.
Yound Myricaria occurs in
small auantities.
   The Weitzes Beih above
St Jakob appears to be so called
from the vague outline of a
2569
butcher's cleaver in rock outcrops.
  The Ochsenlcke are a 
group of small poolks with
little marginal vegetation save
Trichophorum.
   Brugger Alm is a deep
grassy valley overlooked by the
WeissSpitze and Degenhorn
crags.  Towards its head it
becomes filled with scree.
   Leppleskofl is an easy
walk up stable rocks.  A giant
wooden cross has recently
been placed on the summit.
   The tree-line around Brunn
Alm appears to have been
much depressed by grazing.
Nb Pinus cembra.

Seilbahn Brunnalm.
Gr. Leppleikofl.
   A narrow E.-W. ridge.
On the S. side, extensive turf
comes right up to the summit
(2800m).  On the N. side, the
rocks fall abruptly and there
are cliffs and screes without
turf.
