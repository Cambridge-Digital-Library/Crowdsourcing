   The summit rocks are

These meadows are probably
very rich in species, though
none is now flowering.  There
are small Trichophorium flushes.
They must have been much
mowed at one time, but are
now largely neglected (because
of depopulation).  There is some

sheep grazing at Fieldzalin,
where there used to be horned
cattle;  the old Almhutte is in
ruins and a small new hut
has been built.  Most of the
huts shown on the map
have disappeared. There is
not much invasion by trees,
though the area lies well below
the upper limit of forest at
c. 2150 m.  There are occasional
spruce & larch making very slow
growth.
Innerberg Woods.
   Rather dull.  Dense spruce
with a small proportion of
larch increasing upwards.  Cut
in sections, but mainly mature.
2567
Upper edge well-defined.
No Zirm at all except a few
trees at the upper margin.
Ladfratter says that this is
because of the soil*, but possibly
the mining is involved.
   The Lasorling range is
mainly grassland and scree;  very
little forest oe even Latschen.
   The snow-line is at least
3200m on S. facing slopes.
   Oberrseitsee is a deep lake
with shore mainly of boulders.
No aquatic vegetation or fens.
The slpoes above the lake
are mainly slabby brittle rocks
or very large loose boulders.
*Too wet & acid.

[12568-12569]

   The much higher Alples
lakes ([SYMBOL] 6) are in shallow glacial
depressions.  Free of ice but
without evident plant life.

September 26
   Between St Jakob and Lacken
is a tract of river gravels with
scrub, grassland, and young
forest.  It was relatively little
altered by the 1966 floods.  The
scrub is of mainly mature or
over-mature Myricaria bushes
([SYMBOL]19) and Salix purpurea.
Yound Myricaria occurs in
small auantities.
   The Weitzes Beih above
St Jakob appears to be so called
from the vague outline of a
2569
butcher's cleaver in rock outcrops.
  The Ochsenlcke are a 
group of small poolks with
little marginal vegetation save
Trichophorum.
   Brugger Alm is a deep
grassy valley overlooked by the
WeissSpitze and Degenhorn
crags.  Towards its head it
becomes filled with scree.
   Leppleskofl is an easy
walk up stable rocks.  A giant
wooden cross has recently
been placed on the summit.
   The tree-line around Brunn
Alm appears to have been
much depressed by grazing.

Vincetoxicum
Berberis
Pinus sylvestris
Cornus
  On relatively unstable
S. facing screes there is a 
definite pine wood with
Caslamagrostis varia under,
and scattered Vincetoxicum
and bracken.
   Beech is an occasional
2577
minor woiodland constituent in
the Lienzer Klause.   
Similar xerothermal vege-
tation extends in Pasterthal
as far as Oberolang.

Percha  A fine complete Gothic
church with outside painting of
St Christopher.
   Several other apparent Gothic
churches in lower Pustertal.
Pflawenz.  Ehrenburg is a fine 
mediavel castle with outer
curtain walls & towers.  Norman
windows in the main building.[
Near Kiens is an overgrown
spruce hedge.  Most of the

[12578-12579]
2578
trees have developed one
trunk.
  Castanea flourishes and
is naturaslized in the Schabs
area.
   St Leonhard is on a beau-
tifully perfect cone of stabilized
scree.
   The valley has suffered
severely from the 1966 floods,
which destroyed most of the
vegetation in the floor and remo-
ved most of the road bridges.
The worst place is the con-
striction at Mellitz, where work
has nearly finished on a diver-
sion of the road through a 
tunnel in the cliff.

Bridge of Hall
   The upper timbers of the 
bridge at Hall oware much con-
sumed by termites or other
creatures making round holes
c. 3/8 in. dia.
   Each pier consists of two
rows of slightly raked piles, most
of which merely support the
dead weight of the roadway.

[DIAG]
The end of two poiles on each
sisde serve as the bases for
[12582-12583]
2582
three struts of different
angles which run to three
points on the parapet.  From
the ends of these struts hang
three principal transverse joists.
Each of the latter is suspen-
ded from the parapet by
tension points.  The roadway
has other orders of joists:
the planks are lengthwise and
the sidewalks are raised.
The bridge has become much
decayed of recent years and
the N. span is patched with
iron girders.
   Block-houses are still built
in Defereggen ([SYMBOL] 27).The ground 
plan is much influenced by the
2583
length of the logs.  A typical
arrangement is
as shown.
   Very little   [DIAG]
corn is grown 
in Defereggen
but potatoes are frequent,
   Most of the flood damage
in the Ristertal has been
repaired, but some tracts of gravel
remain.

   North of Woolpit the old

still in good condition parallel to
and and a few yards N. of, the Woolpit
bypass.
The road between Clopton  Green
and Woolpit Green (978606) has

valley floor below Bangrove, in
the Bardwell and Sapiston areas,
and around and in Euston 
Park.
   At Ixworth Thorpe is a

At Great Ashfield there are
considerable earthworks of the
