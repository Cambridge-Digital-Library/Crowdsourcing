These meadows are probably
very rich in species, though
none is now flowering.  There
are small Trichophorium flushes.
They must have been much
mowed at one time, but are
now largely neglected (because
of depopulation).  There is some

sheep grazing at Fieldzalin,
where there used to be horned
cattle;  the old Almhutte is in
ruins and a small new hut
has been built.  Most of the
huts shown on the map
have disappeared. There is
not much invasion by trees,
though the area lies well below
the upper limit of forest at
c. 2150 m.  There are occasional
spruce & larch making very slow
growth.
Innerberg Woods.
   Rather dull.  Dense spruce
with a small proportion of
larch increasing upwards.  Cut
in sections, but mainly mature.
2567
Upper edge well-defined.
No Zirm at all except a few
trees at the upper margin.
Ladfratter says that this is
because of the soil*, but possibly
the mining is involved.
   The Lasorling range is
mainly grassland and scree;  very
little forest oe even Latschen.
   The snow-line is at least
3200m on S. facing slopes.
   Oberrseitsee is a deep lake
with shore mainly of boulders.
No aquatic vegetation or fens.
The slpoes above the lake
are mainly slabby brittle rocks
or very large loose boulders.
*Too wet & acid.

   The much higher Alples
lakes ([SYMBOL] 6) are in shallow glacial
depressions.  Free of ice but
without evident plant life.

   Between St Jakob and Lacken
is a tract of river gravels with
scrub, grassland, and young
forest.  It was relatively little
altered by the 1966 floods.  The
scrub is of mainly mature or
over-mature Myricaria bushes
([SYMBOL]19) and Salix purpurea.
Yound Myricaria occurs in
small auantities.
   The Weitzes Beih above
St Jakob appears to be so called
from the vague outline of a
2569
butcher's cleaver in rock outcrops.
  The Ochsenlcke are a 
group of small poolks with
little marginal vegetation save
Trichophorum.
   Brugger Alm is a deep
grassy valley overlooked by the
WeissSpitze and Degenhorn
crags.  Towards its head it
becomes filled with scree.
   Leppleskofl is an easy
walk up stable rocks.  A giant
wooden cross has recently
been placed on the summit.
   The tree-line around Brunn

much depressed by grazing.

Similar xerothermal vege-
tation extends in Pasterthal

Near Kiens is an overgrown

trees have developed one
trunk.
  Castanea flourishes and
is naturaslized in the Schabs
area.
   St Leonhard is on a beau-
tifully perfect cone of stabilized
scree.
   The valley has suffered
severely from the 1966 floods,
which destroyed most of the
vegetation in the floor and remo-
ved most of the road bridges.
The worst place is the con-
striction at Mellitz, where work
has nearly finished on a diver-
sion of the road through a 
tunnel in the cliff.

Bridge of Hall
   The upper timbers of the 
bridge at Hall oware much con-
sumed by termites or other
creatures making round holes
c. 3/8 in. dia.
   Each pier consists of two
rows of slightly raked piles, most
of which merely support the
dead weight of the roadway.

[DIAG]
The end of two poiles on each
sisde serve as the bases for
[12582-12583]
2582
three struts of different
angles which run to three
points on the parapet.  From
the ends of these struts hang
three principal transverse joists.
Each of the latter is suspen-
ded from the parapet by
tension points.  The roadway
has other orders of joists:
the planks are lengthwise and
the sidewalks are raised.
The bridge has become much
decayed of recent years and
the N. span is patched with
iron girders.
   Block-houses are still built
in Defereggen ([SYMBOL] 27).The ground 
plan is much influenced by the
2583
length of the logs.  A typical
arrangement is
as shown.
   Very little   [DIAG]
corn is grown 
in Defereggen
but potatoes are frequent,
   Most of the flood damage
in the Ristertal has been

remain.

   North of Woolpit the old

still in good condition parallel to

The road between Clopton  Green

1. Armallaria.  Several decayed

clumps in the 1964 coppice:
Drought.
   There has been no appreciable
rain for at least 6 weeks.
Soil is driest in Zone 2, where
there are deep cracks.  In Zones
5-6 there is a dry cracked crust,
but underneath the soil (as 
turned up by moles) is moist 
to the touch.   Cracks up to 1 1/2"
wide, most less than 1/2".  Most 
frequent on the rides (including
the smaller rides).  In Zone 1
areas with Callitriche the
soil is slightly moist to the
touch, but rather dusty, and
the Callitriche survives.
No further change in the
2601
state of the trees, though 
many ashes are losing their
leaves very early.
   Coppice is little affected.  Some
ash leaves with gray-brown 
necrotic areas, but the 
shoots are vigorous and their
leaves otherwise still deep
green (they thus keep their
leaves much longer than mature
trees or saplings).  No further
effect observed with other spe-
cies.
   Mercury spectacularly 
affected.  About half of the mercury
in the wood is wilted.  The
carpet in the S. Section is
wilted except for patches where
it still stands;  in the W. Sec-
[12602-12603]
2602
tion (apparently damper) the 
situation is reversed.  Mercury
patches at the base of trees
in Zones 2-4 are alwaysa
severely wilted.
   Honeysuckle also wilted
almost everywhere.
   Oxlip, Lythrum, large Car-
ices unaffected.

is largely dead leaving bare

This field was examined to
see if it could be a late as-

is possible but not convincing.

Very dry now but probably wet
in most years, though no
obvious fen plants.
Remarkable features:
1. Wavy outline with mostly
slight boundary banks, but a
remarkable ditch to the W. with
the bank mainly outside.
2.  No internal earthworks ex-
cept on the E. side: no grips,
rides not ditched.
3.  Remarkably well-preserved
woodland atructure.  Numerous
ok and ash standards up to
2 1/2 ft dia.  Felling goes on at
resent but is probably selec-
tive.
4.  Regeneration of ash fairly good,
though oak poor.  Ash standards

mostly maiden.
5.  Large coppice present but
patchy.
6.  Small coppice cut recently:
large tracts of 4 years' growth,
none more recent seen.
7.  Abundance of Prunus Padus.
This outnumbers P. spinosa [SYMBOL] 34.
Nearly all small coppice.
Stools resemble hazel, cut at
ground level, with more numer-
ous thinner stems.  Has some
tendency to sucker.  Occasionally
treated as large coppice (see
B above, p. 2607).  Frequently
occurs as poles up to 6" dia.,
with a spreading crown (re-
calling Salix caprea in similar
circumstances).  Seedlings not

seen.  Fruit very rare, but
one pole-tree (see sketch map)
had a few racemes with fruit.
8.  Hawthorn rare and ap-
parently all mono.
9.  One alder stool at edge.
10.  Well-defined marginal hedge
on W. and S.W. sides.
11.  Elm areas small and not
spreading.
12.  No MERCURY seen at all.
13.  Numerous familiar spp. are
rare or absent:  primrose, Hera-
cleum, Cirsium palustre, Lythrium,
Hypericum spp.
14.  Ground vegetation appears to
be mainly bluebell and Filipen-
dula.
15.  Coppicing appears to re-
2619
sult in the "tall" vegetation
sequence, dominated by Angelica
and Filipendula, with much
Rubus. Closure is fast.
16.  Holly abundant and sometimes
quite large:  smaller trees also
present, saplings few.
17.  Juncus spp. rare.

   A remarkable and unu-
sual wood, well maintained.
Absence of mercury and of
Crat. oxycanthoides suggests
it is secondsry;  but its out-
line, structure, absence of
internal earthworks, ivy

make it almost certainly
primary.

comes very near the surface
here.)

   There are about a dozen
fine pollard oaks just inside
Shippelton parish by point 225
(938052).  They occur in hedges
and in lines across old
grassland.
   Medievasl house at Crows-
hill, Swaffham.  Rectangular,
splayed walls, main Wall posts
rising from sill to eaves. No
jetty.  Being repaired.
   There is a good inclosed
landscape in the Daffy Green area
of Scaming.
   Holly trees are often seen in
destroyed hedges.  Peterken says he
hs been told threre is a superstition
in Norfolk against felling them.
