80oF. About 3 p.m. black
clouds suddenly appeared and
lightning was seen. This seemed
to pass away to the E., but 
about 3.30 the most tremendous
storm began. Great gusts  of wind
blew up from all points of the
compass, sufficient to break

branches from trees. Lightning
flashes in various directions every
few seconds - quite remarkable
frequency. Pinkish; often several
discharges at once. Stunning
crashes of thunder, some vey
close. Shortly before the storm
reached its height, the rain began
Unbelievable intensity. It did
not run over the edges of the
roofs, but fountains spouted 5-6
ft high from cracks in the bases
of downpipes. For a time
