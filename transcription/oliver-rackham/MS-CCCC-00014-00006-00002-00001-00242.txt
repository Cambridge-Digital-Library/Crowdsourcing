Oct. 19.   [DIAG]
Brought Nicky to Cambridge
and put him in half my balcony,
partitioned off with large flower-
pots etc.
Weather conditions sunny and
very warm.
Nicky very active, walking round
and round the asphalt floor of the
balcony and energetically trying
to climb out. In the morning he
discharged turds and a surprisingly
large quantity of water, raising his
rear off the ground by means of
his tail. He ate dandelion leaves
[18742-18743]8742
and a small amount of lettuce.
Oct. 20.
  Weather similar. Nicky rather
less active - ate a little lettuce.
Does not easily find his way
back to his box at  night, but
sleeps instead among the flower-pots.
Oct. 21.
  Rain most of the day, remark-
ably heavy at times, with thun-
der and lightning.
  Nicky was quite active, 
even in the rain, and stayed
out  in it at night.

  Elm  disease is rare at 
Madingly: not more thsn 2%,

Excavation for the [!!!!Western] Northern
bypass continues apace. The

cavation.

[DIAG]

  It is one of a cluster of
hollows. A is a broad valley-
-bottom hollow, entirely covered
with fen (cf Dickleburgh Moor),
now neglectefd and partly overgrown
with alders & sallows. Around 
the road, on the side of the
valley, is a series of smaller
steep-sided hollows at least one
8749
water-filled: the sketch is in-
tended as a general indication
not an individual depiction.
A small colony of Equisetum
telmateja by the hollow as

Tilia cordata. A fine standard

about 1 1/2 ft dia., in young middle
age. Cordate characters extreme.
  Two quite young trees
(c. 1 ft dia.) in hedge at
Welborne, by the crossroads
061089. Hedge not remarkable.
The nearby hedges contsin horse-

significant.

many half-ruined houses and
other buildings.

Dereham Railway. One track

ments made for it to share

Dereham Bypass road. Much

Hedges
Attleboro-Hingham-Dereham
Survival and condition vari-
able. About 2/3 of the roadsides
have some hedges [!!!!often] usually
cut annually or often more
than once a year. Hedges
generally have 4-6 spp. Hazel
is probably the commonest
dominant. Ash and maple
v ab. Dogwood v ab. spindle
occ. Hornbeam v.r. (see above)
Lanes are generally on the 
surface except on the steeper
slopes. Holly is rare. Clema-
tis remarkably rare. Viburnum
opulus rare. Hedgerow trees
[18752-18753]
8752
many, mostly oak, slightly or
not stagheaded. Saplings [!!!!]
[!!!!] often abundant, oak or
ash, on the more neglected
hedges well above replacement
rate.
  Yaxham to Brakefield Green:
[!!!!more] hedges very numerous,
surrounding a multitude of
little fields, often triangular,
arable or pasture, one with
a bull in it. Hedges similar
in composition but rather
more holly.
  Brakefield Green-Brandon Parva
-Wymondham. Mostly prairie
farming of the worst kind.
Fields of several hundred
acres. Few roadside hedges
- though some hedgerow trees
8753
remain. Remains of hedges
show them to have been mixed.
Hedgerow trees mostly oak and holly
mostly in good condition.
  In  Yaxham parish the
hedges are often rather overgrown.
Hedgerow trees mostly oak, all
in good condition and not
stagheaded. Ash fewer, condi-
tion moderate. Saplings of
oak present (though often cut)
in every hedge, one is rarely
more than 10 yards from an
oakling. Ashlings sometimes
even more frequent. This regen
-eration pattern extends throughout
Yaxham parish and in a few
hedges further east that have
escaped destruction.
  Holly is frequent in
[18754-18755]
8754
Yaxham, abundant further E.
Hollies often left standing in
an otherwise destroyed hedge
and are then often the
commonest remaining tree.
Well seen in Brandon Parva.
Female hollies are fruiting
unusually heavily this year.
  Polyploidy once seen from
Hingham to Dereham, several
times in  roadside banks
in Yaxham.

Camberley Park. Still reaches its
full N.E. extent up to the
Carleton Forehoe road. May
contain some ancient trees
but none very large, seen in 
poor light.
8755
  Around Hingham and in  Yax-
ham parish there is a good deal
of grassland. Rough grass in
many valley bottoms, notably the
Blackwater at Reymerston.

5 Nov.
  The generally dry and warm
autumn has been broken by
heavy rain alll day.
  Nicky almost torpid, but
objects to being shut up in his

10 Nov.
Very fine and warm weather
all this week. Today well into
the 60s and warm even at 
night - warmer than most of
the summer. There has been
a series of rasther strong de-
[18756-18757]
8756
pressions, mostly dry, but with
strong winds. Cold front, very
fine, warm. long-lasting, and
slow-moving.

Elm Disease.
Oxford - 30%. Many big p-type
elms still alive but difficult 
to assesss because leaves much
stripped by gales.
Cassington apparently 100%, apart
from elm hedges, which are
slightly singed here & there.
Blenheim Park and East End
8757
Combe apparently 100% of elms
over 6 ft high, including many
elms in small groves & invasions.
Charlberry: landscape said to
be transformed by the death of
thousands of elms. Not clear
whether any left alive.

  The road from Cassington to
Bladon is a typical enclosure
road, cutting across R & F, straight,
with hedges of elm occasionally
mixed with hawthorn. W. of
Barleigh Wood it changes to
a sinuous road with one
hedge of at least 7 spp; the
other hedge may 87be more
recent.

WOODSTOCK
PARK

Pinsley Wood.       says there is
one medieval record of certain 
tenants having to maintain the
boundary and in recompense
being entitled to the produce of
"fence acres" in the wood.
  Wood was coniferized many
years ago.
8761
Woodstock Park.
  Visited in the High Lodge
area.
  The park is bounded by a
strong v-shaped ditch wioh a
drystone wall in the bottom. Not
clear how much of the data from
the original imparking by Henry I.
NW of the entrance lodge the
upcast from the ditch forms an
inner bank but this feature is
absent from the part SE of the
lodge.
  Entrance lodge is a small Geor-
gian house - high white-painted
gates.
  Park is said not to have 
any  official deer. Parts are
grazed by sheep, but the part
we saw is mown if treated at
[18762-18763]
8762
all.
A trench exposes a heavy
tenacious clay. Strongly gleyed 
orange & grey.
  The park boundary coincides 
with the parish of Blenheim - pre-
sumably a late alteration in the
parish system.
  The whole area  seen inside
the park, except New Park,
is thinly set with oaks, usually
about 6 to the acre.
A-generation: mostly pollards
typically 3-4 ft [????] dia. x
6 ft high. Probably not all the same
age. Pollard boughs c. 1 - 1 12 ft dia.
Pollards probably 300 - 400 years
old but pollarded 200 - 250 years
ago. All are slightly stagheaded
a long time ago (bark & sap-
8763
wood gone); now in good con-
dition apart from slight gale dam-
age. Probably most are red-rotted
but this seldom shows. One great 
oak, a maiden with an ele-
phant's foot base, has a scar from
the collapse of a second trunk
forking at the base. Pollards
mostly spreading in habit.
B-generation: all maidens, ap-
parently about 250 years old,
mostly c, 3 ft dia. Taller and
not very spreading in habit, tho'
variable. Slight to moderate
history of staghead like the As.
C-generation: prob. 150 years
old, some staghead.
The B-generation are the
most numerous; the A-genersation
form about a third of the oaks
