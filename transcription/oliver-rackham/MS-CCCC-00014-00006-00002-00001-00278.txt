House as originally built and
as adapted c. 1770.
(A) Jetty (or rather a false-jetty)
supported wholly on planks (later
removed & underbuilt). Inserting
the false-jetty involves reusing
the original half-storey floor by
about a foot. A new bridging-
joist B was inserted in top of
the old joist C. The old summer
1537
[DIAG]

was discarded
and a new one 
inserted. The
use of loadbearing
planks is said to be typically
New England of that period.
Original floor-level apparently
about 5 ft 10" below bottom of
summer.

Chimney. Wholly renewed.
Probably the big upstairs room was
heated as well as the downstairs
room.
[21538-21539]
1538
Tool-marks. Common - rafters &
common-studs of 1665 & 1710
appear to be all sawn with
pitsaw.
  Princ. rafters of 1665: distinct
V-notches, about 2 ft apart,
plus adze-facets (slightly concave).
  Princ. posts to summers of
1665 ; adze-facets only, includng
on faces concealed by cladding
or by chimney-braces.  No certain
evidence of Vs. Timbers are
slightly to moderately waney. Bark
left on in places.
  Princ. rafters of 1710: all three
kinds of mark. evidently rough &
cut with Vs, hewn nearer to size
with [DIAG], and finished with
adze.
1539
Cladding. 1665 had mill sawn
boards about 12" wide, very rough,
on the outside.  Riven laths on
inside. Space between packed with
clay etc. Only a small part sur-
vives.
  1710 was similar but with
half-baked bricks ser in mortar
instead of the clay.
  Floorboards mill-sawn.
  Roof-boards mill-sawn. Outer
shut roof at rear preserves some
early shingles of  original roof beneath.

Timber species.
  1665 frame - all appears to be
white oak.
  1665 ards - all pine
  1710 frame - mostly oak, some
pine (?later).

1540
The house is extensively writ-
ten up in Cumming's book.

  Several other early houses in
Boston, including the Witch House
which has been incompletely
restored.
  Later clapboarding has long
runs of boards designed to
avoid end-joints; commonly the
boards run the whole length of a
wall.

  The Gadney house and most
others seen in situ have no evidence
of the kind of subsidence usual
in English frame houses.
1541
   Boston to Providence
South Bay. Field of innumerable
piles of stakes, the foundations of
vanished stilted buildings.
Wigwam Ponds. Extensive swamps;
Phragmites, highbush blueberry.
Now partly submerged. Nuphar in
cracks.
Westwood to Providence. Continu-
ous woods, predominantly oak.
Patches of white pine and of
mixed deciduous on illuvial
sites. Soils very sandy in places,
almost heath-balds. Siliceous
rox sometimes exposed.
Burns of a few acres occur
on very sandy thin soils. Trees
re-sprouting.
Many oaks etc. are multi-
stemmed (2-4 stems).
[21542-21543]
1542
Small swamps here & there.
  Pass Mansfield.
  Almost no agricuture seen the 
whole way. 
  Burnt once (in last 4 years)
about 3% of total - probably
less away from railway.
Railroad Ties. Appear to be
oak. Old ones are scappled
with single ax-cuts.

    Providence to New London.
  Numerous pools & bayous and
a great broad inlet of the sca*
all in thick deciduous woods
down to high-water.
  Extensive pines (presumably
Pirigida) gregariously mixed
with oaks forming in low rather
sparse stand (c. 20 ft high)
* Greenwich Harbour.
1543
Soils on deep gravel & sand
with patches of boulders presumably
moraine.
Pass Kingston.
After  Kingston more oakwoods
often with rather sparse oaks to dense
shrubs, and pine barrens.
  Then Westerly. This part of New
England is thinly populated: one is
usually out of sight of a house.
  Then more woods. mainly oak,
most multi-stemmed. Drystone
walls in the woods. Occ. swamps
with Typha & Phragmites.
  Great estuary at Mystic with
lowlying shores. Many branches.
  White egret in Mystic estuary.
  Rural waterfront, less rotten
than most, with many sailing
staithes.
[21544-21545]
1544
             Elms
Boston.  Many hundreds of elms
on The Common; probably about
1% felled in the last few years
and 1% diseased.  Said to be
sprayed against bark-beetles
(D. Houston).
Saybrook to Madison. Elms occ.,
apparently all healthy. Elms
seem to be uncommon in S.E.
New England.

Gypsy Moths.
3rd instar, about 3/4" long, in
Madison. White oaks are almost
defoliated - leaves eaten to skele-
tons. Other trees badly shotholed.
 Dr Houston got his trees profes-
sionally sprayed from the ground
using a high-volume spray of
1545
large droplets. As yet probably
no effect. Continuous audible
pitter-patter of frass, like a rain
shower. Many caterpillars have
descended on silk theads; they
are expected to crawl to treetrunks
and climb back up.
  Caterpillars & frass make life
unpleasant out of doors.

Crickets. Incessant chirping well
into the night, like short bursta of
a small electric drill every 2
sec. or so.  NMsny insects not
synchronized.

Juniperus virginiana. Abundant
on stabilized sand by seashore
Madison.

Masonry-lined cellar
No settlement of frame.
Reminiscent of Gadney house: has
two floors of full height; but certainly
all of one build except for rear
outshut (top-plate is all in one
length). Best room (timbers!!!!] cased or pine
fine wainscot) is upstairs in L. half;
second-best room (timbers exposed but
well wrought) is downstairs. Two rooms
in R. half have rough timbers originally
plastered over.
[21550-21551]
1550
Hartford.
Plane-tree with severe branched
foliage through anthracnose - this
is very common. Especially
in wet springs - easily
recovers.
Fall of Red Oak.

37" dia.
No roots on one side
Armillaria 'pipestem'
Ustulina.

Haven, crushing two cars.
East Rock Park.
Cliffs of red trap with scree
below.
Woods of blk birch, blk oak,
occ. on street.
1551
  Extensive very light recent 
fire in undergrowth.
  New Haven is surrounded by
many such cliff ranges; situation
said to resemble that of Newhaven,
Sussex.
  Gipsy-moth defoliation very
severe on oak. All pin-cherries are
totally leafless and their main
stems wreathed in massive webs
of tent-caterpillars.

Yeliowjacket. Large wasp-like crea-
ture, bigger than a hornet, which
we found in the Meigs-Bishop loft.
My companions were very scared of
it.
