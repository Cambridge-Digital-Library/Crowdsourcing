July 11.
Worth Forest, Oldhouse Waren,
Tilgate Forest, Brantridge

  A very large tract of wood-
land S. of Crawley.

[14766-14767]
4766
River's Wood, Ardingly

by bracken.  Heather in rail-
way earthworks.

Butcher's Woods, Clayton.
Oak-birch with some ash.
Gault.
  Several small beech
woods on chalk in the N.
part of Brighton.  Some with
ivy carpet & up trees.
  Deep chalk cuttings in
Hove are densely overgrown
4767
with scrub mainly privet.
Hypericum calycinum and
Valeriana rubra ab.

  The W. side of the Adeir
estuary is a fine landscape
apart from near the shore.
Shoreham airport is a large
grass airfield. Lancing College
is the only building of any
size before the hills.
  There is an old wooden
bridge of c. 28 trestles over 
the Adeir.
  There is much enteromor-
pha on the muddy foreshore
and groynes at Worthing.
Castle Goring, Goring-by-sea,
is a large Victorian folly.

[14768-14769]
Clapham Common.
  This wood, and that
on the S, side of the A27, is 
a mixture (or probably a
mosaic) of oak, Castanea,
Betula pendula (ab., locally
dom.) ash (infrequent). Ap
parently neutral.  No coppices
seen.  Few old conifers.
  On London clay!
  Margins destroyed by road
widening.

Poling Corner Wood, Poling.

cut 5 years ago.
  On London Clay!
  Margin destroyed by road
widening.

Arundel Park  
  Boundary wall c. 6 ft high,
9"-12" thick, rubble of a
form of chalk harder than
clunch with a ragstone
cleavage: seen from inside
the town to Whiteways Lodge,
usually c. 5 yds E. of the 
A284.
Boundary woods chiefly
beech and ash, local Ulnus
procera.  Beech usu. domin-
ant, under-mature to 
mature trees of c. 100 ft high,
[14770-14771]
4770
slender, much-branched at
a moderaste spacing.  Ash
tall, over-drawn, among the 
beech.
  The Park, as seen from the
N., is very hilly, with tracts
of old grassland, scrub and
woodland.
  The woods W. of the 
road are mainly beech but
much replanted.
  The downs N. of Whiteways
Lodge are mainly plowed.

[14772-14773]
4772
Large timber-framed outhouse
or small barn:  [!!!!] double-
-framed walls with common
studs nailed, not morticed,
and intersected by the wind
braces;  side-purlin roof; probably
contemporary with the house
although it contains much
reused timber of greater age;
assembly numbers both con-
temporary with building and
earlier. Not far away is an
earlier timber-framed house.
  Surroundings with irregu-
lar and ill-defined woods
and groups of scattered trees.
Quercus petraea dominant.
Alders along the stream.
A recent assart made into
4773
pasture, with stumps remain-
ing.  A few over-mature oaks.
No evidence of coppicing or
pollarding.
  Large pond or small
lake made by damming the
stream.  R.-J. says there
are two others now empty.
Some trouble with this one
owing to undercutting and
alder roots causing lraks in
the dam.
  Rhododendron ponticum
occurs in the woods.
On Lower Greensand.
A cavity was insoected in 
the base ofd a large apparently
sound Quercus petraea.  Tree
c. 3ft dia.; cavity c. 11/2 ft. Sur-
4774
rounded by soft yellow rot
with white plates and flecks -
very like Polyporus squamosus.
Presumably caused by Poly-
porus e.g. frondosus.  No ob-
vious entry wound.

Fences in the Bignor 
Park area recently made
commonly have sawn oak posts
with mortices to receive 2
rails.  Rails of the trunks of
      [DIAG]
oaks c. 9"-10" dia. each
split, or occasionally sawn, into
4 or 6 lengths. Use for oak
4715
coppice?

  Pinus radiata commonly
planted and flourishing within
3 miles of the sea.
  Elms are nearly all U.
procera in a small weakly
suckerng foirm.  Very abundant
on all geologies. No large trees
seen.  A very few trees of
U. hollandica (a straggling form
with few large-medium leaves)
were seen;  also a few of
an elm like U. stricta but
less strictly fastigiate in a 
formal planting.
  About 90% of hedges seen 
were of one species;  mainly
hawthorn, some elm.  Most of
