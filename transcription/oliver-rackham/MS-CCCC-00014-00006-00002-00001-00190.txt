4765           [DIAG 1971]
July 11.
Worth Forest, Oldhouse Waren,
Tilgate Forest, Brantridge
Forest.
  A very large tract of wood-
land S. of Crawley.
  Mainly standards (widely
spaced) and poles.
  Stds chiefly oak.
  Files chiefly birch (both spp.)
alder (in Stanford Brook valley),
ash (in Brantridge).
  Scattered old pines behav-
ing as stds.  Some hazel & Sx capola
  No coppice seen.
  All the part seen from the
railway is intact save some
large coniferized tracts in the
Crawley portion of Tilgate

[14766-14767]
4766
River's Wood, Ardingly
  Mainly conifers of vari-
ous ages and species,
some over-mature.
  This and the previous 
woods have acid
ground vegetation dominated
by bracken.  Heather in rail-
way earthworks.

Butcher's Woods, Clayton.
Oak-birch with some ash.
Gault.
  Several small beech
woods on chalk in the N.
part of Brighton.  Some with
ivy carpet & up trees.
  Deep chalk cuttings in
Hove are densely overgrown
4767
with scrub mainly privet.
Hypericum calycinum and
Valeriana rubra ab.

  The W. side of the Adeir
estuary is a fine landscape
apart from near the shore.
Shoreham airport is a large
grass airfield. Lancing College
is the only building of any
size before the hills.
  There is an old wooden
bridge of c. 28 trestles over 
the Adeir.
  There is much enteromor-
pha on the muddy foreshore
and groynes at Worthing.
Castle Goring, Goring-by-sea,
is a large Victorian folly.

[14768-14769]
Clapham Common.
  This wood, and that
on the S, side of the A27, is 
a mixture (or probably a
mosaic) of oak, Castanea,
Betula pendula (ab., locally
dom.) ash (infrequent). Ap
parently neutral.  No coppices
seen.  Few old conifers.
  On London clay!
  Margins destroyed by road
widening.

Poling Corner Wood, Poling.
  A mixture of oak, Betula
vernicosa, ash, Prunus
avium (marginal).  No replanting.
  Small coppice present, all
hazel, much of it apparently
4769
cut 5 years ago.
  On London Clay!
  Margin destroyed by road
widening.

Arundel Park  
  Boundary wall c. 6 ft high,
9"-12" thick, rubble of a
form of chalk harder than
clunch with a ragstone
cleavage: seen from inside
the town to Whiteways Lodge,
usually c. 5 yds E. of the 
A284.
Boundary woods chiefly
beech and ash, local Ulnus
procera.  Beech usu. domin-
ant, under-mature to 
mature trees of c. 100 ft high,
[14770-14771]
4770
slender, much-branched at
a moderaste spacing.  Ash
tall, over-drawn, among the 
beech.
  The Park, as seen from the
N., is very hilly, with tracts
of old grassland, scrub and
woodland.
  The woods W. of the 
road are mainly beech but
much replanted.
  The downs N. of Whiteways
Lodge are mainly plowed.

Coombe Wood, Bury.
  Chiefly beech.
  Myrtus luma is planted
at Bury.
4771
Wood E. of Bignor Park.
005159, in West Burton.
  Oak-ash 2-layered
with hazel ex-coppice.
  Gault.
  
Wood E. of Waltham Park.
007168, in Cold Waltham.
  Mixture of closely
spaced oak & beechg, as cop-
pice.
  Lower Greensand.
 
 Bignor Park Cottage, Bignor.
  Home of Dr Rudd-Jones, Direc-
tor of the Glasshouse Crops Re-
search Institute.
  The dower-house of Bignor
Park.  Regency brick house.
[14772-14773]
4772
Large timber-framed outhouse
or small barn:  [!!!!] double-
-framed walls with common
studs nailed, not morticed,
and intersected by the wind
braces;  side-purlin roof; probably
contemporary with the house
although it contains much
reused timber of greater age;
assembly numbers both con-
temporary with building and
earlier. Not far away is an
earlier timber-framed house.
  Surroundings with irregu-
lar and ill-defined woods
and groups of scattered trees.
Quercus petraea dominant.
Alders along the stream.
A recent assart made into
4773
pasture, with stumps remain-
ing.  A few over-mature oaks.
No evidence of coppicing or
pollarding.
  Large pond or small
lake made by damming the
stream.  R.-J. says there
are two others now empty.
Some trouble with this one
owing to undercutting and
alder roots causing lraks in
the dam.
  Rhododendron ponticum
occurs in the woods.
On Lower Greensand.
A cavity was insoected in 
the base ofd a large apparently
sound Quercus petraea.  Tree
c. 3ft dia.; cavity c. 11/2 ft. Sur-
[14774-14775]
4774
rounded by soft yellow rot
with white plates and flecks -
very like Polyporus squamosus.
Presumably caused by Poly-
porus e.g. frondosus.  No ob-
vious entry wound.

Fences in the Bignor 
Park area recently made
commonly have sawn oak posts
with mortices to receive 2
rails.  Rails of the trunks of
      [DIAG]
oaks c. 9"-10" dia. each
split, or occasionally sawn, into
4 or 6 lengths. Use for oak
4715
coppice?

  Pinus radiata commonly
planted and flourishing within
3 miles of the sea.
  Elms are nearly all U.
procera in a small weakly
suckerng foirm.  Very abundant
on all geologies. No large trees
seen.  A very few trees of
U. hollandica (a straggling form
with few large-medium leaves)
were seen;  also a few of
an elm like U. stricta but
less strictly fastigiate in a 
formal planting.
  About 90% of hedges seen 
were of one species;  mainly
hawthorn, some elm.  Most of
[14776-14777]
4776
the rest are hawthorn and
ash.  A few mixed hedges
in the Bury area.
  Dogwood is particularly
rare, seen on chalk.
July 12.    WARNES HOTEL
  The Arun  WORTHING
marshes are mostly plowed.
High Down is the only chalk
hill of the Littlehampton ridge.
It has some chalk grassland
and an hill-fort.

Wood E. of Burchetts in Cuck-
field, 326228.
  On wealden.
  Standards & poles probably 
no coppice.
  Oak, Castanea, birch, alder.
4777
Monken Hadley Common,Middle-
sex.
  A well-defined wood but
with some ill-defined internal 
glades and open spaces.
  Mixture of oak and beech
with a minority of ash and
hornbeam.
  Probably no coppice.

Hatfield Park, Herts.
  Millward's Park, the only part
seen from the railway, con-
sists of standard oaks large
and widely spaced underplanted
with Scots. Presumably once
coppice but now none remains.
The part of the Park
around 232075 does not appear

[14778-14779]
4778
to retain any parkland trees;
probably long separated.

Spoil-bank Wood, Potter's Bar.
  On an embankment over
a valley between two tunnels.
Not on 1st ed. O.S.
  Scrub and small standards.
Oak, birch, hawthorn.

  Welwyn Garden City.
A few fragments of heath-
land with scattered scrub oaks
remain by the railway.
  Nothing appears to remain of
Woodhall Wood.

Harmer Green Wood.
  Appears to be mainly ash
4779
and hornbeam.

Monk's Wood, Stevenage ("Omley
Wood" 1st ed. O.S.)
  Survives, surrounded by fac-
tories and playing fields.

Watery Grove, Knebworth survives.

Bygrave Park Wood survives.

July 14.
  Flowering of the sempervivum
about at its peak.
  Night-scented Stocks coming
into flower.
  The railway cutting at Trum-
pington is now about half
mown.
[14780-14781]
4780
July 17.
  Letter from G.H.R. reporting
the excavation of a leaking
gas main under the street
which may account for the 
effects of p.4738-41.
July 19.
Lepidium latifolium locality
on the S. side of the Bald-
ock road just before the
first houses in Baldock.

Lilley Park
A mixed deciduous wood
including Ulmus hoillandica.

Wendover.
Some 12 timber-framed
buildings seen.  Probably
4781
16th to 18th cent.  Almost all
oak, quality very variable and
often scrubby.  2 late buildings
contain as small proportion of
other timbers - pine and ?beech.
        CADSDEN

      [DIAG]

[14782-14783]
4782
Valley bottom has recently
been chalk grassland.

Beech coppice on spur.
Stools to c. 3 ft dia., cut
at least 3 times.
Poles up to c. 1/4 ft dia
Trees very chlorotic.
Ground veg. dominated by
Sanicle.
Epipactus sp.
Campanula trach.  ab.

Felled woodland in dry

Ash coming up in very
large quantity, presumably
in succession to beech.
4783
Cx remota in plateau woodland

Elom area.
Mainly procera poles & stools,
some carpinifolia.
Mixed with mature larch.
some beech, chiefly stools.
Hornbeam in hedge.
One maple std.
     PULPIT HILL
One pole of a very 
chlorotic nearly dead beech,
steep slope.  1'01/2" dia.
130±15 years.  Stool dia.
c. 3 ft.  Apparently coppiced
but could be pioneer.

[14784-14785]
4784
Pulpit Hill.
Herminium Monrchis: c. q   2
spikes.
2 juniper seedlings.
both in lightly rabbit 
grazed area.

Summit of hill:
Beech dom., great variety of
forms.  Mostly said to date
from the great mast year of
1922.  c. 4 - 15 in dia.
Elder ab.
Yew ab., to c. 4 in dia.
Juniper dead.
Ulmus glabrus: several large
pioneer trees.
Ground mostly bare, but much
sanicle.
4785
Sorbus aria occ.
A very steep (c. 30o) [!!!!N.W.]S.W.
facing slope.

      HILL FORT
Hill Faort
Trees Beech, large & widely
spaced, to c. 2 ft dia.  Mostly
pioneer & coppice.

Mercury loc on earthworks

  Earthwork is a square 
with rounded corners.  Ditch
with internal bank (not as in
diagram).  Outer bank and
ditch in two places.
  Divided in two unequal
parts by a much slighter
cross bank and ditch,
which carries a row of
beech stools evidently a hedge.
This continues to the S.E. It may
also continue to the N.W., but
this could not be determined
because the ground falls
away very rapidly, and is
encumbered with fallen trees
4789
elder bushes, &.
  This must be secondary
woodland of no great age
because of the hedge.  Para-
doxes:
1.  Mainly sanicle type despite
the level ground.
2.  Oxalis loc., indicating aci-
dification on the plateau.
3.  Asperula loc. ab. despite
evidence of sec. woodland.
  This is perhaps not the
first generation of trees, be-
cause most of them are of
the high-forest form.
The dividing hedge appears
to form the wood boundary on
the 1st ed. O.S.; it has the
right orientation.

[14790-14791]
4790
  
  Giant Coppice Beech Stools.
Coppice beech.  Very steep c.
facing slope.
Stool 1, 9'4" & 8'0" x
c. 1 1/2' (mean, on slope.)
7 living poles up to c. 14"
across; very variable in
size, some only c. 3", and
numerous dead ones.  [SYMBOL]

2. Other giant stools, one
of them linear, 21' x 3''
perhaps 3 trees.
  These possibly form a
hedge meeting the [!!!!±NE] W.
angle of the foot.  Surrroun-
ding woodland entirely tall
beech on very small shallow rend-
zina scree with little ground
vegetation.
4791
Interpretation of Cadsden.
  Slopes mainly pure beech,
soe pioneer, some coppoiced,
some high forest.  Readily
succeeded by ash when
felled.
  Bottoms of dry valleys
mainly grasssland, kept as
such (D.E.C.) by combination
of frost & rabbits, and ten-
ding to succeed to beech
wood.  Boundaries of glades
"soft" [!!!!] without earthworks
or zonation.
  Plateau goes onto clay
with flints.  Although domina-
ted by beech, it has small
quantities of many of the boul-
der-clay trees and traces

[14792-14793]

    [DIAG]

[14794-14795]
4794
of coppice structure.  Woodland
grasses (inc. Hordelynus) and
other groudn vegetation most
abundant here.  Elm inva-
sion much as in boulder-clay
woods.
  Carpinus occurs only in
a hedge and the bottom of
a dry valley.
  E. boundary with farmland
is very slight, with only the
smallest bank.  Formed ap-
parently by a path contin-
uing as a hollow way.

  The plateau was prob-
ably formerly mixed woodland
with beech as a constitu-
ent, coppiced much as on
4798
the boulder clay, later conver-
ted to beech dominant.
  The slopes and valley 
floors are much lesas certain.
The total absence of hard
boundaries suggested more
grazing at one time.  Much
of the beech wood here is
perhaps secondsry to grsss-
land; even now it has a 
very limited ground flora.
Some of the beech has
been coppiced.
  The steep slopes perhaps
provided a refugium for
beech during a period of
intensive coppicing, since
when it has recolonized
the area including the
[14796-14797]
4796
plateau (at the expense of
oak, now largely disappeared).
The balance between beech
and ash appears to be a
delicate one except on the
shallowest soils.

   Slopes od Pulpit Hill.
The track from Longdown
Farm to the road between
Great Kimble and Askett pas-
ses through a series of woods,
all at least 95% beech.
Next to Longdown Hill the
woods appear on the 1822 O.S.
At the N.W. they are said
to date deom 1922.
  The track itself is a road
well engineered sand ingeniously
4797
traced (cf 1822 O.S.).
  The older wood is per-
haps coppiced: the younger
has a high proportion of
pioneer coppice-like trees, but
in addition various other
forms including some with
straight upright trunks. All 
are very chloirotic and many
in the older wood dead or dying.
  Other trees auch as
Sorbus aria, Taxus, Sambucus,
Ulmus glabra are much
more frequent in the younger
wood.
  Ground vegetation very 
limited, mostly sanicle; no
mercury.
  Boundary with grassland
[14798-14799]
4798
rather diffuse but probably
stable.
  It is possible that these
woids originatd from hedges,
one of which runs across
the hill-fort.  The giant 
stools beside the hill-fort
represent another hedge which
probably ran across open
land in 1822.
  Living juniper is confined 
to a number of scattered
bushes among hawthorn scrub.
Apart from the seedlings of
p. 4694, there are no young
plants. The old bushes seen
were very over-mature and
dying back.
4799
  Holly is curiously rare in
these woods.  No evidence that
it has played any part in the 
succession.

    Little-boys' Heath.
  Much altered by replan-
ting with Thuja &, but this
is sporadic and many of
the very tall beeches and
other trees remain.  The "regen-
eration circle" is intact.
  Along the road is a broad
low bank with external
ditch which wanders in the
usual wood-bank way.
  No trace of coppice structure.

Great Kimble & Great
Hampden parishes.

  Dr Watt has pointed out that
this best development of the 
plateau woods has a non-
-woodland name.  the road-
side earthwork is apparently
of a woodland type, and
the woodland ground flora
includes many apparently sen-
sitive species. Probably unal-
tered on the 1822 map.

  A very artificial wood in
its present form. Marginal
beech hedge of some antiquity,
with a fairly recent belt of
holly inside.
  Has changed little since
1962.  Thw small beeches which
in places formed a continuous 
understorey are still only c. 4 ft
high and show little evidence of
forming leaders.
Birch area over mull

encroached upon by surrounding
beech.
May be on the site of 
an ancient wood:
(i) Carex pallescens (if this is
an indicastor in this area).
(ii) Bank alongside the road 
(but not the other two sides
seen, althouygh one of these is
a parish boundary).
(iii) Name on the 1st ed. O.S. is
Priest Wood, which suggests that
it is the source of the name of
"Priestwood Common" adjoining (but
in a different parish, now a
suburb of Great Missenden.
4805
Angler Spring, Great Missenden
  Dense dark beech wood,

   Between Bierton and Wing[!!!!]
 [!!!!] is a large tract of "in-
 closure" landscape, now mainly
 corn.  Hedges mainly pure
 hawthorn, usually maintained.
 Hedgerow trees few, chiefly
 elm. Remarkable lack of
 woods and ancient hedges.
   Chicksands Wood appears 
 to be coniferised and recently
 extensively poisoned.

Valerian
Pimpinella
Asparagus

Deer Fence.
  Continues to produce a
difference in browsing, with
exceptionally good growth (for
Hayley) inside.
  About 12 holes found,
all within 9 in. of the ground,
made by fraying away a
few meshes of the net ap-
parently with teeth.  Not big
enough to admit a deer.  In
                   
[14818-14819]

one place, a single hawthorn
stool just beside one of the
[!!!!stools] holes was nibbled.  The
larger holes were mended by
us with string.
  A tawny owl was trap-
ped and killed on the N.W.
side of the net, where it
passes through uncut wood-
land and would be very
difficult for a bird to see when
flying low in bad light.
  Valeriana officinalis occurs
in quantity on the ballast of
the old railway opposite the
Triangle, apparently by colonization
by seed.

July 23.
  The Corynephorus site at
Wangford is a large active
blow-out aound 759842.
  Hollow Heath, Hilboro' is
chiefly Calluna with rather
dense bracken over most of the
area. About 50 acres survive
as heathland, in the S. part 
along the Ickboro' boundary.
  On the way from Swaffham-
Fakenham-Burnham Mar-
ket- Burnham Westgate
most of the hedges are of
2-3 species.  Around the Burn-
hams there are several sunk
lanes with mixed hedges.
  The woods on Brancaster
Downs are of tall deciduous

[14820-14821]

trees;  there appears to have
been some recent felling.

Scolt Head Island (Drs Combe
& Sporne, Part II class).
  Visited on foot both ways,
Norton Creek outgoing on the ebb
being the deepest ford (about
waist deep).

  On the Nod there are numerous
ant-hills in places where they
must get covered by spring tides.
Covered in Festuca rubra turf
with large gaps where soil is
being actively deposited.  These
gaps are sites where Frankenia
flourishes as an anthill plant.
Rabbit scratchings erode it on
4821
older hills.
Fucus vesiculosus:  free-living
spiral form in creeks with rather
fast flow.  Easily confused with
F. spiralis.
Bostrichia scorpoides.  Continuous
understorey to limonium vulg.
-Salicrina mesh.  Habit
like Cladonia arbuscula.  Probably
prevents regeneration of higher plants
.
Triglochin maritionum.  Smell of 
collegiate laundries.

Polypodium vulgare is frequent
on N. facing slopes of older
dunes, Hut Hills.

[14822-14823]
4822
Dryop spinul frequent in
sheltererd hollows of House Hills.

Rosa spinosissiona frequent
and apparently native on Hut
and House Hills.

  Limonium humili is[!!!!]
[!!!!] much more abundant
relative to L vulgare than hereto-
fore, and is frequent on the
middle levels of Hut and Mussel
Marshes.
  Aphids occur on the roots
of L. vulgare, a fact discovered by
Andrew Malloch here some years
ago.
  Zostera hornemanniana
4823
 
[DIAG]

Zostera nana & Z. horneman-
niana
was found in abundance in
an unusual habitat, namely the 
rather fierm sandy bottom of
a large creek at the N.E.
corner of Cockle Bight.  A
dense stsnd c. 100 yards long,
flowering in abundance.  Just
exposed at extreme low tide.

[14824-14825]
4824
  Z. nana is relatively scarce
and seldom flowering, on rather
finer material, scattered over
a large area of northern
Cockle Bight.
  Much rubbish apparently
from foreign ships gets washed
up on the outer beach.  A plastic
bottle bore a Flemish inscription
explaining that the contents
were, among other things, for
removing "hartnokkige flecken".
  Lactuca sinosa is particu-
larly abundant this year, in
a zone at the foot of the gray
dunes just above extreme
high water, on Hut, Long, and
House hills, and on the main
ridge between Hut and House.
4825
  Frankinia is flowering in
great abundance. [SYMBOL] 25.
  Euphorbia paralias frequent.
  Hydrobia, a minute snail,
conical, c. 1 1/2 mm long, occurs in
great quantities on bare mud
of the Salicornial zone.  They
are often found on the tops of
Salicornia plants, which they climb 
and remain in singly or in
small groups.
  Rabbits are said to graze
the salt marshes, returning to
the dunes when the tide comes
in. Moderate recent activity.
  Between Upper Cockle Bight
and Spiral Marsh is a flat 
shingle platform saidtro result
from a breakthrough destroying

[14826-14827]
4826
the dunes upon it.  The stones
are almost completely lichenized
with Vermicaria maura &.
  Spiral Marsh creek describes
2 complete turns, said to be
caused by an eddy as it
empties in the absence of
wave action.
  Dunes are said always
to be on shingle platforms,
even where the latter are not
ovbious and never to invade
mud.
  Pans in salt marshes
usually lie in chains indicating
the course of obsolescent creeks.
  The grove of Populus alba
around the House has increased
by suckering.
4827
  Calvatia gigantea: several
sporophores found in grassland
at the House.
  Rosa nyosa forms extensive
thickets at the House.  [SYMBOL] 26.
  Tamarix survives in quantity
but has probably not spread from
the original planting.
  Cakile grows in great quan-
tity at a higher level than 
usual on the seaward side of 
the main ridge of dunes.
  Spartina is relatively infre-
quent.
  The chronology of Scolt
Head Island is curiously vague
and its relation to land &
sea level changes little known. 
  Much of the Suaeda fruti-

[14828-14829]
4828
cose which forms a belt at the
highest levels of the marshes
is old and moribund.
  Calystegia soldanella flower-
ing in abundance.
  3-4 magnifienbt henbane
plants on the Nod, c. 3 ft
high: [SYMBOL] 27.  In dune blow-
-outs.
  Juncus maritimus and
J. gerardi occur in brackish
situations beside tracks on the 
Nod.
Artemisia maritima occurs
on the Nod, but apparently
not on the Island.

July 25.[!!!!August 1.] Little Wilbraham Fen.
Verbascum thapsus.  Very
tall & dense stand on a
derelict site at the back of
the Chem Labs.

Lactuca serriola. Abundant
on waste land around 
and on street.
----------------------------------
pear to contain no timber-framed
buildings, nor any house ear-
lier than c. 1650.
  Verbascum pulverulentum
occurs frequently on verges and
cuttings between Hunstanton
and Dersingham.  About 25 plants
seen, singly and in small groups.
The road-men cut round them.

[14830-14831]

  I was in charge of a party 
of about 20 of the Naturalists' 
Trust.

Geology.  Chalk marl near
the surface  everywhere seen.
Up to c. 2 ft of coarse 
gravel on top in places; peat
----------------------------
  Royden Common is a vast
tract of bog with scattered
birch, visible from the King's
Lynn by-pass.
  Hedges between Hunstanton 
and Denver are mostly of 1-2
species.  Ulmus carpinifolia is
common.
Elm disease has not been
seen so far.

towards Frog wnd showed
extensive convolution of the
more superficial chalk by 
periglacial action.
  The Little Wilbraham
River is raised and probably
hydrologically isolated.

State.  East of Fen farm
site entirely arable and im-
proved grassland.
  W. of Fen Farm [!!!!at least] about
100 acres of rough fen of
various kinds between Long
Drove and the river.  Probably
more rough fen between
Long and Short Droves.  Some
30 acres of rough fen in
Fulbourn.
4833
  Since 1963 the acreage of
rough has declined but the
quality of the remainder is
little altered, despite the
improvements to Little Wilbra-
ham River.
  The fen is lightly grazed,
and probably for this reason
the bushed areas are well
defined with sharp, though
convoluted, edges, and show
us recent extension.  They
are chiefly in slightly raised
areas.

Populus canescens:  a 
small stand near Fen Farm.
  Samolus valerandi;  fre-
quent in ditches &c.
