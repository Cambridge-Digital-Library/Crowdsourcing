4765           [DIAG 1971]
July 11.
Worth Forest, Oldhouse Waren,
Tilgate Forest, Brantridge
Forest.
  A very large tract of wood-
land S. of Crawley.
  Mainly standards (widely
spaced) and poles.
  Stds chiefly oak.
  Files chiefly birch (both spp.)
alder (in Stanford Brook valley),
ash (in Brantridge).
  Scattered old pines behav-
ing as stds.  Some hazel & Sx capola
  No coppice seen.
  All the part seen from the
railway is intact save some
large coniferized tracts in the
Crawley portion of Tilgate

[14766-14767]
4766
River's Wood, Ardingly
  Mainly conifers of vari-
ous ages and species,
some over-mature.
  This and the previous 
woods have acid
ground vegetation dominated
by bracken.  Heather in rail-
way earthworks.

Butcher's Woods, Clayton.
Oak-birch with some ash.
Gault.
  Several small beech
woods on chalk in the N.
part of Brighton.  Some with
ivy carpet & up trees.
  Deep chalk cuttings in
Hove are densely overgrown
4767
with scrub mainly privet.
Hypericum calycinum and
Valeriana rubra ab.

  The W. side of the Adeir
estuary is a fine landscape
apart from near the shore.
Shoreham airport is a large
grass airfield. Lancing College
is the only building of any
size before the hills.
  There is an old wooden
bridge of c. 28 trestles over 
the Adeir.
  There is much enteromor-
pha on the muddy foreshore
and groynes at Worthing.
Castle Goring, Goring-by-sea,
is a large Victorian folly.

[14768-14769]
Clapham Common.
  This wood, and that
on the S, side of the A27, is 
a mixture (or probably a
mosaic) of oak, Castanea,
Betula pendula (ab., locally
dom.) ash (infrequent). Ap
parently neutral.  No coppices
seen.  Few old conifers.
  On London clay!
  Margins destroyed by road
widening.

Poling Corner Wood, Poling.
  A mixture of oak, Betula
vernicosa, ash, Prunus
avium (marginal).  No replanting.
  Small coppice present, all
hazel, much of it apparently
4769
cut 5 years ago.
  On London Clay!
  Margin destroyed by road
widening.

Arundel Park  
  Boundary wall c. 6 ft high,
9"-12" thick, rubble of a
form of chalk harder than
clunch with a ragstone
cleavage: seen from inside
the town to Whiteways Lodge,
usually c. 5 yds E. of the 
A284.
Boundary woods chiefly
beech and ash, local Ulnus
procera.  Beech usu. domin-
ant, under-mature to 
mature trees of c. 100 ft high,
[14770-14771]
4770
slender, much-branched at
a moderaste spacing.  Ash
tall, over-drawn, among the 
beech.
  The Park, as seen from the
N., is very hilly, with tracts
of old grassland, scrub and
woodland.
  The woods W. of the 
road are mainly beech but
much replanted.
  The downs N. of Whiteways
Lodge are mainly plowed.

Coombe Wood, Bury.
  Chiefly beech.
  Myrtus luma is planted
at Bury.
4771
Wood E. of Bignor Park.
005159, in West Burton.
  Oak-ash 2-layered
with hazel ex-coppice.

  Home of Dr Rudd-Jones, Direc-
tor of the Glasshouse Crops Re-
search Institute.
  The dower-house of Bignor
Park.  Regency brick house.
[14772-14773]
4772
Large timber-framed outhouse
or small barn:  [!!!!] double-
-framed walls with common
studs nailed, not morticed,
and intersected by the wind
braces;  side-purlin roof; probably
contemporary with the house
although it contains much
reused timber of greater age;
assembly numbers both con-
temporary with building and
earlier. Not far away is an
earlier timber-framed house.
  Surroundings with irregu-
lar and ill-defined woods
and groups of scattered trees.
Quercus petraea dominant.
Alders along the stream.
A recent assart made into
4773
pasture, with stumps remain-
ing.  A few over-mature oaks.
No evidence of coppicing or
pollarding.
  Large pond or small
lake made by damming the
stream.  R.-J. says there
are two others now empty.
Some trouble with this one
owing to undercutting and
alder roots causing lraks in
the dam.
  Rhododendron ponticum
occurs in the woods.
On Lower Greensand.
A cavity was insoected in 
the base ofd a large apparently
sound Quercus petraea.  Tree
c. 3ft dia.; cavity c. 11/2 ft. Sur-
[14774-14775]
4774
rounded by soft yellow rot
with white plates and flecks -
very like Polyporus squamosus.
Presumably caused by Poly-
porus e.g. frondosus.  No ob-
vious entry wound.

Fences in the Bignor 
Park area recently made
commonly have sawn oak posts
with mortices to receive 2
rails.  Rails of the trunks of
      [DIAG]
oaks c. 9"-10" dia. each
split, or occasionally sawn, into
4 or 6 lengths. Use for oak
4715
coppice?

  Pinus radiata commonly
planted and flourishing within
3 miles of the sea.
  Elms are nearly all U.
procera in a small weakly
suckerng foirm.  Very abundant
on all geologies. No large trees
seen.  A very few trees of
U. hollandica (a straggling form
with few large-medium leaves)
were seen;  also a few of
an elm like U. stricta but
less strictly fastigiate in a 
formal planting.
  About 90% of hedges seen 
were of one species;  mainly
hawthorn, some elm.  Most of
[14776-14777]
4776
the rest are hawthorn and
ash.  A few mixed hedges
in the Bury area.
  Dogwood is particularly
rare, seen on chalk.
July 12.    WARNES HOTEL
  The Arun  WORTHING
marshes are mostly plowed.
High Down is the only chalk
hill of the Littlehampton ridge.
It has some chalk grassland
and an hill-fort.

Wood E. of Burchetts in Cuck-
field, 326228.
  On wealden.
  Standards & poles probably 
no coppice.
  Oak, Castanea, birch, alder.
4777
Monken Hadley Common,Middle-
sex.
  A well-defined wood but
with some ill-defined internal 
glades and open spaces.
  Mixture of oak and beech
with a minority of ash and
hornbeam.
  Probably no coppice.

Hatfield Park, Herts.
  Millward's Park, the only part
seen from the railway, con-
sists of standard oaks large
and widely spaced underplanted
with Scots. Presumably once
coppice but now none remains.
The part of the Park
around 232075 does not appear

[14778-14779]
4778
to retain any parkland trees;
probably long separated.

Spoil-bank Wood, Potter's Bar.
  On an embankment over
a valley between two tunnels.
Not on 1st ed. O.S.
  Scrub and small standards.
Oak, birch, hawthorn.

  Welwyn Garden City.
A few fragments of heath-
land with scattered scrub oaks
remain by the railway.
  Nothing appears to remain of
Woodhall Wood.

Harmer Green Wood.
  Appears to be mainly ash
4779
and hornbeam.

Monk's Wood, Stevenage ("Omley
Wood" 1st ed. O.S.)
  Survives, surrounded by fac-
tories and playing fields.

Watery Grove, Knebworth survives.

Bygrave Park Wood survives.

July 14.
  Flowering of the sempervivum
about at its peak.
  Night-scented Stocks coming
into flower.
  The railway cutting at Trum-
pington is now about half
mown.
[14780-14781]
4780
July 17.
  Letter from G.H.R. reporting
the excavation of a leaking
gas main under the street
which may account for the 
effects of p.4738-41.
July 19.
Lepidium latifolium locality
on the S. side of the Bald-
ock road just before the
first houses in Baldock.

Lilley Park
A mixed deciduous wood
including Ulmus hoillandica.

Wendover.
Some 12 timber-framed
buildings seen.  Probably
4781
16th to 18th cent.  Almost all
oak, quality very variable and
often scrubby.  2 late buildings
contain as small proportion of
other timbers - pine and ?beech.
        CADSDEN
Cadsden

      [DIAG]

[14782-14783]
4782
Valley bottom has recently
been chalk grassland.

Beech coppice on spur.
Stools to c. 3 ft dia., cut
at least 3 times.
Poles up to c. 1/4 ft dia
Trees very chlorotic.
Ground veg. dominated by
Sanicle.
Epipactus sp.

Felled woodland in dry
valley.
Ash coming up in very
large quantity, presumably
in succession to beech.
4783

Elom area.
Mainly procera poles & stools,
some carpinifolia.
Mixed with mature larch.
some beech, chiefly stools.

     PULPIT HILL
One pole of a very 
chlorotic nearly dead beech,
steep slope.  1'01/2" dia.
130Â±15 years.  Stool dia.
c. 3 ft.  Apparently coppiced
but could be pioneer.

[14784-14785]
4784
Pulpit Hill.
Herminium Monrchis: c. q   2
spikes.
2 juniper seedlings.
both in lightly rabbit 
grazed area.

Summit of hill:
Beech dom., great variety of
forms.  Mostly said to date
from the great mast year of
1922.  c. 4 - 15 in dia.
Elder ab.
Yew ab., to c. 4 in dia.
Juniper dead.
Ulmus glabrus: several large
pioneer trees.
Ground mostly bare, but much
sanicle.
4785
Sorbus aria occ.
A very steep (c. 30o) [!!!!N.W.]S.W.
facing slope.

      HILL FORT
Hill Faort
Trees Beech, large & widely
spaced, to c. 2 ft dia.  Mostly
pioneer & coppice.

One large coppice P. avium.

Ground vegetation
Sanmicle ab, dom. on slopes
Nettle loc.
Circaea loc. ab.
Oxalis rare
Brambles loc. dom.

[14786-14787]
4786
One Q. robus c 2 ft dia:
Semi-pioneer
Elder rare
Sorbus aria one tree c. 9"

Deschampsia rare
Chamaenes loc ab.

On S.E. side nunmerous

One oak withg these beerchesd

Fragaria loc ab.
Holcus lan. rare
4787
One Cratae, mono- bush

[DIAG]

Holly - one tree at foot of a beech.
Viola nv. or reich - loc. ab.
Lactuca memblis - loc. ab.
with violet
Stratchom smell

[14788-14789]
4788
Mercury loc on earthworks

  Earthwork is a square 
with rounded corners.  Ditch
with internal bank (not as in
diagram).  Outer bank and
ditch in two places.
  Divided in two unequal
parts by a much slighter
cross bank and ditch,
which carries a row of
beech stools evidently a hedge.
This continues to the S.E. It may
also continue to the N.W., but
this could not be determined
because the ground falls
away very rapidly, and is
encumbered with fallen trees
4789
elder bushes, &.
  This must be secondary
woodland of no great age
because of the hedge.  Para-
doxes:
1.  Mainly sanicle type despite
the level ground.
2.  Oxalis loc., indicating aci-
dification on the plateau.
3.  Asperula loc. ab. despite
evidence of sec. woodland.
  This is perhaps not the
first generation of trees, be-
cause most of them are of
the high-forest form.
The dividing hedge appears
to form the wood boundary on
the 1st ed. O.S.; it has the
right orientation.

[14790-14791]
4790
  
  Giant Coppice Beech Stools.
Coppice beech.  Very steep c.
facing slope.
Stool 1, 9'4" & 8'0" x
c. 1 1/2' (mean, on slope.)
7 living poles up to c. 14"
across; very variable in
size, some only c. 3", and
numerous dead ones.  [SYMBOL]

2. Other giant stools, one
of them linear, 21' x 3''
perhaps 3 trees.
  These possibly form a
hedge meeting the [!!!!Â±NE] W.
angle of the foot.  Surrroun-
ding woodland entirely tall
beech on very small shallow rend-
zina scree with little ground
vegetation.
4791
Interpretation of Cadsden.
  Slopes mainly pure beech,
soe pioneer, some coppoiced,
some high forest.  Readily
succeeded by ash when
felled.
  Bottoms of dry valleys
mainly grasssland, kept as
such (D.E.C.) by combination
of frost & rabbits, and ten-
ding to succeed to beech
wood.  Boundaries of glades
"soft" [!!!!] without earthworks
or zonation.
  Plateau goes onto clay
with flints.  Although domina-
ted by beech, it has small
quantities of many of the boul-
der-clay trees and traces

[14792-14793]

    [DIAG]

[14794-14795]
4794
of coppice structure.  Woodland
grasses (inc. Hordelynus) and
other groudn vegetation most
abundant here.  Elm inva-
sion much as in boulder-clay
woods.
  Carpinus occurs only in
a hedge and the bottom of
a dry valley.
  E. boundary with farmland
is very slight, with only the
smallest bank.  Formed ap-
parently by a path contin-
uing as a hollow way.

  The plateau was prob-
ably formerly mixed woodland
with beech as a constitu-
ent, coppiced much as on
4798
the boulder clay, later conver-
ted to beech dominant.
  The slopes and valley 
floors are much lesas certain.
The total absence of hard
boundaries suggested more
grazing at one time.  Much
of the beech wood here is
perhaps secondsry to grsss-
land; even now it has a 
very limited ground flora.
Some of the beech has
been coppiced.
  The steep slopes perhaps
provided a refugium for
beech during a period of
intensive coppicing, since
when it has recolonized
the area including the
