Gweek Woods.
  Typically oak (apparently
both apecies mixed).  Single stemmed,
occasionally with traces of
coppicing.*  Pronounced corkscrew
habit, main trunk without
a straight length, no large
branches.  Understorey sparse
hazel.  Ground wet, with 
bryophyte-covered boulders.
  This type is typical of
wet valley bottoms.  On hillsides
it often occurs, but there 
is often a more open wood-
land with much hazel.
  Beech frequent on better
drained sites;  not corkscrewed.
The minor road from Gweek

to Mawgan Cross leaves the
valley floor with corkscrew oaks
c. 80 ft high arching over
the road.  As it  ac=scends the 
side of the valley the oaks
diminish, continuing to arch
over the  road until about
10 ft high (growing on tall
hedges).  On the plateau,
even smaller oaks (to c. 4 ft
high) grow in the hedges
and contiunue the arched
shape and corkscrew habit.

Ecin, Uxg, Molinia, Agrostis setacea

Bracken & Uxeurop only
on field walls & barrows.

  Short-heath is on a gleyed
podsol on the plateau and
gentle slopes; much denser &
taller than on the lizard, de-
spite  burning 3 years ago,
with no hummock & pan struc-
ture.  This is attributed to better
drainage than on the Lizard.
  E. ciliaris heath is confined
to slopes with abundant slowly
moving water.
  Frost dsmage to E. ciliaris
is irregular in incidence and
often confined to the lower
3029
branches of the plant.  Most
frequent at the bottom of the
slope where  a bank creates a
slight frost-hollow, but by no
means universal here, some plants
escaping completely.
  Bordered by several
woods ofd scrub oak with
few beech and many fine
coppiced hollies.  Woods apparently
devastated.
Nansavallon Woods appears 
to be tsll scrub recovering
from devastation.

Trevella Woods.
  Almost entirely oak; a
little Q. Ilex.

branches & upper trunks. Mixed
spreading and narrow habits:
possibly 2 generations. Little
sign of coppicing.  Sparse hazel:
no other understorey.  Little
ground vegetation now visible.
Ivy scarce.  Abundant epiphytes.
Polypodium hc.

Tregoney Woods.
  The woods around Trewarthenick
are rather varied with old
plantings of beech, conifers, &
Rhododendron.  Some fragments
of old oak wood wth traces of
coppice structure.
  At the tidal limit of the
Fal is a tract of Carr with
big Salix bushes and small
3031
trees.  Numerous big pole
alders and small alder stools.
  Some giant Cornish elms
near Tregony village.

Pendower in Veryan.
  A bay with small dune
systems (some at sea level
and some about 10 ft up on 
low rocks).  Said to be a 
site of Trifolium occidentale,
but a prolonged search failed
to find it and it appears
to be a mistake for a Medi-
cago.
  The valley ([SYMBOL] 13) is rather
steep, covered in bracken
with gorse patches.  Woody
communities:

[13032-13033]
3032
(a) Prunus scrub (as on the 
Lizard).
(b) Sallow carr in the bottom.
(c) Patches of Ulmus stricta
(some apparently not on old
habitations) at the side of
the valley floor.

  At Melinsey, Veryan, there
is a sunk lane between vey
high hedges of elm and
ash whose roots overhang the
road by up to 3 ft because
of erosion.
  There are wide brackish
grazing marshes along both
branches of the Fal at Ruan
Lanihorne.
  Lanoran Wood is mainly
3033
on steep slopes (the road cannot
be taken in 2nd gear!). Mainly
corkscrew oaks among big
boulders.  By the stream is
an extensive quagmire with
a remarkeable elm wood
of over-mature trees and
fallen logs.
  The Lamorran arm is
dammed off to make a 
shallow fresh-water lake with
reed-beds.
  The woods nearer Tre-
gothnan are mainly mature
plantations with many giant
trees of various species.

Tregothnan Gardens.
Clematis Armandii - evergreen
early-flowering, yellow flowers.

Lardizabala biternata - like
Akebia, but stem stouter;  leaves
evergreen, biternate.

Shaded barn almost entirely
of Thuidium tamariscinum.

Erica arborea - freestanding
bushes up to 7 ft high.

Thuja plicata - gigantic
candelabrum tree of pear
shaped habit:  see next page.

Cupressus macrocarpa  several
giant trees of untidy habit
with intricate masses of dead
branches in the lower part.

Myrtus lunia

Piaeris (Ericaceae)

  There are many remarkable 
conifers, some probably over 100 ft
high.  Abies spp particulary not-
ble.  They show much storm
damage but great vitality in
regenerating leaders.
3037
Dicksonia: about 20 trees,
6 - 10 ft high, 12 in. dia.
Fronds 6 ft long, 3 1/2-pinnate
Each tree has c. 30 fronds.  In
an open grove under light
shade of tall oaks & pines.
Overgrown with ivy.  About 10
new fronds to each tree.

Quercus suber:  a massive
gnarled tree.  Leaves very
convex, hairy below.

Gaultheria shallon.  Shrub
with big sessile cordate
coriaceous serrate leavrs.
