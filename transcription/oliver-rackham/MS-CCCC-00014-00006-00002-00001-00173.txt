April 12.         ST KEVERNE
Gweek Woods.
  Typically oak (apparently
both apecies mixed).  Single stemmed,
occasionally with traces of
coppicing.*  Pronounced corkscrew
habit, main trunk without
a straight length, no large
branches.  Understorey sparse
hazel.  Ground wet, with 
bryophyte-covered boulders.
  This type is typical of
wet valley bottoms.  On hillsides
it often occurs, but there 
is often a more open wood-
land with much hazel.
  Beech frequent on better
drained sites;  not corkscrewed.
The minor road from Gweek

to Mawgan Cross leaves the
valley floor with corkscrew oaks
c. 80 ft high arching over
the road.  As it  ascends the 
side of the valley the oaks
diminish, continuing to arch
over the  road until about
10 ft high (growing on tall
hedges).  On the plateau,
even smaller oaks (to c. 4 ft
high) grow in the hedges
and contiunue the arched
shape and corkscrew habit.

Ecin, Uxg, Molinia, Agrostis setacea

Bracken & Uxeurop only
on field walls & barrows.

  Short-heath is on a gleyed
podsol on the plateau and
gentle slopes; much denser &
taller than on the lizard, de-
spite  burning 3 years ago,
with no hummock & pan struc-
ture.  This is attributed to better
drainage than on the Lizard.
  E. ciliaris heath is confined
to slopes with abundant slowly
moving water.
  Frost damage to E. ciliaris
is irregular in incidence and
often confined to the lower
3029
branches of the plant.  Most
frequent at the bottom of the
slope where  a bank creates a
slight frost-hollow, but by no
means universal here, some plants
escaping completely.
  Bordered by several
woods old scrub oak with
few beech and many fine
coppiced hollies.  Woods apparently
devastated.
  Nansavallon Woods appears 
to be tall scrub recovering
from devastation.

Trevella Woods.
  Almost entirely oak; a
little Q. Ilex.
  All trees with corkscrew
 
[13030-13031]

branches & upper trunks. Mixed
spreading and narrow habits:
possibly 2 generations. Little
sign of coppicing.  Sparse hazel:
no other understorey.  Little
ground vegetation now visible.
Ivy scarce.  Abundant epiphytes.
Polypodium hc.

Tregoney Woods.
  The woods around Trewarthenick
are rather varied with old
plantings of beech, conifers, &
Rhododendron.  Some fragments
of old oak wood with traces of
coppice structure.
  At the tidal limit of the
Fal is a tract of Carr with
big Salix bushes and small
3031
trees.  Numerous big pole
alders and small alder stools.
  Some giant Cornish elms
near Tregony village.

Pendower in Veryan.
  A bay with small dune
systems (some at sea level
and some about 10 ft up on 
low rocks).  Said to be a 
site of Trifolium occidentale,
but a prolonged search failed
to find it and it appears
to be a mistake for a Medi-
cago.
  The valley ([SYMBOL] 13) is rather
steep, covered in bracken
with gorse patches.  Woody
communities:

[13032-13033]
3032
(a) Prunus scrub (as on the 
Lizard).
(b) Sallow carr in the bottom.
(c) Patches of Ulmus stricta
(some apparently not on old
habitations) at the side of
the valley floor.

  At Melinsey, Veryan, there
is a sunk lane between vey
high hedges of elm and
ash whose roots overhang the
road by up to 3 ft because
of erosion.
  There are wide brackish
grazing marshes along both
branches of the Fal at Ruan
Lanihorne.
  Lanoran Wood is mainly
3033
on steep slopes (the road cannot
be taken in 2nd gear!). Mainly
corkscrew oaks among big
boulders.  By the stream is
an extensive quagmire with
a remarkable elm wood
of over-mature trees and
fallen logs.
  The Lamorran arm is
dammed off to make a 
shallow fresh-water lake with
reed-beds.
  The woods nearer Tre-
gothnan are mainly mature
plantations with many giant
trees of various species.

Cupressus macrocarpa  several
giant trees of untidy habit
with intricate masses of dead
branches in the lower part.

Myrtus lunia

Piaeris (Ericaceae)

  There are many remarkable 
conifers, some probably over 100 ft
high.  Abies spp particulary not-
ble.  They show much storm
damage but great vitality in
regenerating leaders.
3037
Dicksonia: about 20 trees,
6 - 10 ft high, 12 in. dia.
Fronds 6 ft long, 3 1/2-pinnate
Each tree has c. 30 fronds.  In
an open grove under light
shade of tall oaks & pines.
Overgrown with ivy.  About 10
new fronds to each tree.

Quercus suber:  a massive
gnarled tree.  Leaves very
convex, hairy below.

Gaultheria shallon.  Shrub
with big sessile cordate
coriaceous serrate leaves.

Ilex dipyrena.  Holly with
narrow leaves with a long

   Several huge beeches.
   Bryophytes and lichens
not particuarly remarkable:
less vigorous and extensive 
than at Lanarth.  No Teloschists.
  House, one of Wilkins's

great works, is architecturally
rather overdone.  Curious combi-
nation of Chilmark-like stone
and terracotta.  Fantastic
skyline of chimneys, turrets,
and pipes.  Carved in many
places "B.F." (Boscaven Fal-
mouth).  Splendid stable court
with a huge gateway and
gatehouse-tower.
   A great avenue of Quercus
ilex runs several miles from
the house to the lodge gates
at Tresillian.
   In the grounds is a 
well-appointed hermitage with
fireplace.
3041
        Gweek.
On the hard between the
two creeks are several
semi-derelict industrial buil-
dings.  There is s shed whose
roof is supported by posts,
each post a monolith of
granite standing some 12 ft
out of the ground.  They
are about 1 ft square and 
have been split out with
wedges & feathers & left
rough.

Old lime-kiln, Gweek.  [SYMBOL 21]
Fig  A single large bush in
the rubble filling the top shaft
of the kiln.

Daphne laureola  Several small
bushes in the rubble on top 
of the kiln.

Cotoneaster simonsii.  Several
bushes, of different ages, near
the edge of the top of the 
kiln.

Iris foetidissima.  In deeper
soil, with Daphne, on top.

The lime-kiln is a 
massive brick structure which
3043
[DIAG]

has long been ruinous.  The
top is evidently vaulted snd 
is now a formless mass of
earth and bricks.  All these
plants appear to be bird-sown,
the fig being grown locally.

   In Coverack Mill valley is
a very intricate field system

[13044-13045]
3044
with small woods and patches
of heath much as on the 
2 1/2 in. map.
   No sign of Arum italicum
at Coverack.
   Asplenium marinum on
Chynhalls Point has been
much damaged by frost ([SYMBOL] 11.
12). Wherever fronds project
from crevasses they are turned
the colour of brown paper.
Younger fronds become yellowish.
Plants escape chiefly where
there is an overhang above.
New growth arising from the 
rhizome.
   There is a small serpen-
tine tor at the top of the
Channel View lane.
3045
April 13.
   The earliest inflorescences of 
Smyrnium are fully open at
Coverack.

Devichoys Wood.
   A varied deciduous wood
hardly coniferized at all.
Mainly oaks - usually big
trees with corkscrew habit,
nearly all 1-trunked.  Some
areas of apparently ash cop-
pice, not cut for at least 15
years.  Many big hollies.

Nansavallon Wood, Kea.
   Seen from a distance.  A
large wood unconiferized but
apparently recovering from

[13046-13047]
3046
devastation.  Some areas are
birch scrub (rare in Cornwall).

Pencalenick Woods, St Clement.
   Almost entirely deciduous.
A valley wood mainly of
oak (corkscrew habit, ex-cop-
pice) with some beech of
uneven age.  Numerous fallen
ash and other trees by the
beck.

Tresillian Wood, St Clement.
          [DIAG]
The river
is bordered 
by a 
long
avenue
3047
of Quercus ilex leading to
Tregothnan.  Above it on a steep
slope is a wood shown in the
Lanhydrick Atlas.  This consists
of apparently even-aged
corkscrew oaks, a few evidently 
of coppice origin.  Little un-
derstorey.

Woods N. of Tresougear, Probus.
Small tracts of hazel &
ash simple coppice cut within
the last 20 years.

Ladock Wood
Most recently coniferized,
but with areas of tall
coppice or scrub.
[13048-13049]
3048
  The S.W. fringes of Bodmin
Moor, around Temple, are
being slowly invaded by sparse
hawthorn bushes.
  Bodmin Moor is largely
covered by a Molinietum which
becomes tall and tussocky when
not grazed.
  The northern slopes of
Dartmoor are rolling downs
behind which are more rugged
hills, precipitous in places, 
crowned with tors.
  Okehampton Castle is in
a curious situation on the 
shoulder of a hill overlooked by 
steep slopes.
  There are numerous small
patches of fairly recently cut
3049
coppice around the N. sides
of Dartmoor.
  The fields in this area
have wide hedges like those
of E. Cornwall but less mas-
sive and on slighter banks.
Lines usually irregular.  They
usually rely on thickness 
for stock-proofing but some 
have recently been laid.

Drews Clieve, N. of Exeter.
  A large wood on a steep
slope above the Exe. Mainly
pole-sized and larger ex-cop-
pice oaks: some oak high-for-
est.  Tracts of birch, old planted
pine, and small areas of re-
cent larch.  Some similar but

[13050-13051]
3050
smaller woods in the Alphin
valley W. of Exeter.  Corkscrew
habit visible even here.  Epiphytes
few.
  Brent Knoll is an
abrupt campanate hill crowned
with earthworks.  N.
of the village is a 
low ridge with a     [DIAG]
series of narrow strip
fields running up
to the ridge.  These are perman-
ent grass, the hedges with 
much Cornish elm.
  Cornish elm is much the
commonest hedgerow tree in
the Somerset Levels and may
form a large part of the main-
tained hedges.
3051
  North of the Mendips, the 
ditches in the grazing marshes
are hedged, usually both sides.
Either hawthorn or elm or a 
mixture.  This elm appears
not to be U. stricta.  The levels
have systems     [DIAG]
of flat-topped
ridge & furrow
with transverse
grips, evidently the remains
of a water-meadow system.
  
  Reversed-S ridge & furrow
occurs around Langley Burrell
Wilts.

Elms at Sutton Courtenay
        "Abbey".
  
[13052-13053]
3052

[DIAG]

Ring width very narrow
in callus at first, increasing
later.
Suggested sequence:
1. Avenue planted c. 1650.
2. Rapid growth to c. 1790.
3. Polyporus squamosus or Fomes
ulmarius enters through wounds
and reduces the whole tree to
3053
a hollow shell.  Process assumed 
to take 50 years.
4. Large branches sawn oiff c.
1840 (to prevent collapse).  Callus
forms around edges of holes
and spreads over inside of shell.

This is an avenue of
large elms, apparently carpini-
folia, all of which were
truncated to c. 20 ft some
25 years ago. The log 
described is the only one
not removed, and is apparently
the upper section of a very
massive tree with a columnar 
trunk.  Very hollow from
top to bottom.  Several large
branches had disappeared

[13054-13055]
3054
flush with the trunk, leaving
big holes into the cavity.  These
had callused over and callus 
and bark had continued to
grow over the inside of the
hollow.  Ring sequence in the
sectioned callus establishes
that this process had gone 
on for over a century.
  This establishes the great
age of some large elms,
and shows that they can 
exist as hollow shells for
well over a century (since 
the  callus extended over the
inner surface almost immediately
when the branches were 
removed, showing that the
hollow existed already at
3055
that time).

In Nuneham Park, Nune-
ham Courtenay, there are
some very large oaks and
beeches representing planting, as 
well as a few big old pol-
lards.  Much of the woodland
appears to be secondary and
none of it contains coppice.

  Large Ulmus glabra (?)
about 18 in. dia., isolated
tree.  Forked and one part
recently collapsed making a
big clearing.  Large woodpecker
hole.
  One hornbeam stool seen:
about 2 ft x 9 in.
Wood is a series of H
3057
and O areas, not obviously
differing in drainage, not over-
lapping.  Both notably dry: no
surface water anywhere.
  Deep sinuous ditch or
small stream: no obvious
upcast, big stools rooted in
its banks.
  Single Pinus sylvestris c.
12in. dia., not apparently
native, thin bark, small
crown, unhealthy with thin
needles.  No stumps or logs
to be found.

  Structure of the wood is in
general very similar to Hayley:
standards (oak, few ash)
denser than in all but a

[13058-13059]
3058
few areas of Hayley.  Absence
of bluebell zones is notable;
mercury and oxlip do not
overlap.  No acid areas seen.
  Standards are mostly
young-mature, the collapsed
elm was the only over-
-mature one seen.
  Much Cx pendula in the
Forestry Commission ride.
  The non-reserve part has
been coniferized several years
ago and nothing remains of
its structure. Little Haley Wood
has also been coniferized.
  Wood-bank well preserved

A134, Cockfield.  Both sides
of the winding road in the
Warbanks area.  The ditch
[13060-13061]
3060
is very massive, apparently part
of an earthwork system, and
winds sinuously generally
parallel to the road but
much nearer in some places
than others.  Where the
road becomes straight, the
earthworks become a normal 
hedge bank.  Abundant mer-
cury and big ash and other
stools.

In flower:
Oxlips.  A small minority of

Salix spp.  [SYMBOL] 25.
Hazel.  Male catkins over.
Some female flowerts still open.
Anemone.  Abundant.

  Allium ursinum is very

Now with fully expanded leaves.
About 50% cover where it
occurs:  sharp-edged stands without
any isolated plants.  Little
smell even when trodden on.
  Many coppice oaks have
been cut in Front Fell.  The
uncoppiced part of this Fell
contains numerous oak stools,
some with up to 8 trunks.
 
[13062-13063]
3062
  Coppicing is now finished 
for the season.
  Birch has an enormous
sap flow when cut;  this
remains sticky and becomes
a bright yellow toffee-like mass,
perhaps because of fungal
action.
  Clematis is locally very
abundant in Strawberry Bsnk
and Foxhunters', forming
tangled thickets and growing
to the tops of tall oaks.

Monks' Park Wood.

towering column of black
smoke. It was dispersed

strong S.W. wind.  The rolling
clouds were photographed 
from the roadside beteeen

from Corpus field, whence it
must have reached at least 
as far as Coton (8 miles).
