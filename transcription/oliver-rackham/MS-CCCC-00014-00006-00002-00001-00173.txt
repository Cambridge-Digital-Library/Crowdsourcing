Gweek Woods.
  Typically oak (apparently
both apecies mixed).  Single stemmed,
occasionally with traces of
coppicing.*  Pronounced corkscrew
habit, main trunk without
a straight length, no large
branches.  Understorey sparse
hazel.  Ground wet, with 
bryophyte-covered boulders.
  This type is typical of
wet valley bottoms.  On hillsides
it often occurs, but there 
is often a more open wood-
land with much hazel.
  Beech frequent on better
drained sites;  not corkscrewed.

to Mawgan Cross leaves the
valley floor with corkscrew oaks
c. 80 ft high arching over
the road.  As it  ac=scends the 
side of the valley the oaks
diminish, continuing to arch
over the  road until about
10 ft high (growing on tall
hedges).  On the plateau,
even smaller oaks (to c. 4 ft
high) grow in the hedges
and contiunue the arched
shape and corkscrew habit.

  Short-heath is on a gleyed
podsol on the plateau and
gentle slopes; much denser &
taller than on the lizard, de-
spite  burning 3 years ago,
with no hummock & pan struc-
ture.  This is attributed to better
drainage than on the Lizard.
  E. ciliaris heath is confined
to slopes with abundant slowly
moving water.
  Frost dsmage to E. ciliaris
is irregular in incidence and
often confined to the lower
3029
branches of the plant.  Most
frequent at the bottom of the
slope where  a bank creates a
slight frost-hollow, but by no
means universal here, some plants
escaping completely.

few beech and many fine
coppiced hollies.  Woods apparently

to be tsll scrub recovering
