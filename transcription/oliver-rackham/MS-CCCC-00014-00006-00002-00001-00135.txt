The original status of 
the loam area is not clear.
Adamoon (p. 370) says shrubs
were sparse and (Pl. 12) shows

[10272-10273]
no ash. Most of it has 
been replanted for many
years but there is no sign
of any old coppice. Pine
does well here but fails
on most parts of the clay.
Much birch has come
in in "intact" areas, especially
near the loam. All pendula.
The service tree has a 
spreading habit. It is sure-
rounded by a ring of young
trees, up to c. 2 in. diam.,
occur up to c. 5 yards outside
the tree's canopy. This is in
a strip of "intact" woodland
consisting mainly of hazel
coppice.
Campanula trachelium, Pim-
pinella magna, Conopodium, and Galeobdolon
were seen only on and near the 
Mertonage Bank.
Ground is rather wet,
especially in felled areas
where there is standing water.
Adamoon's societies (except
Fragaria) are still very
evident. On the day, Mer-
curialis corresponds to V-VI;
Spiraea to II-III-IV; Spir-
aea-Carex to I. Spiraea-Des-
champsia is a variant of II
still very prominent where
Adamoon described it.
Primroses are associated
particularly with the Mertonage
Bank and perhaps with parts
of the main ride.
Paris is rare.
Birch apparently all pendula.

The ridge-[????]-furrow in the
Lane was discovered by David
Coombe. 4 furrows evenly
spaced. They end to the N.E. at the 
cross ditch and to the S.W.
peter out about loft beyond
the cross ride. A careful
search of the S.W. half of the
Lane failed to find any. [SYMBOL].
The ridges are marked by
abundant primroses and
by big poplars in rows.
A small blind ditch was

[10276-10277]
found in the unridged N.
end of the Lane. 
[DIAG]
Coppicing has reached the
S. end of the hornbeam area.
Maple bleeds very copiously 
when coppiced.

Typical 3-storeyed

wood rather open and ground

Another hot and sticky

[10304-10305]
but without result for signs
of jumping in.

Cockayne Hatley Wood cont.
Ia. [!!!!]This elm[!!!!] area shows
signs of severe disturbance
Ash stools few and rather
small, apparently stunted by
competition with the elm.
Much ivy. Cowslip-primrose
hybrid in a rather dense
part. This does not seem
to be ditch-bound.
II. eastern border strip.
Possibly an old drift
way. Indistinguishable in
ground flora or structure from
the rest of the wood.
III. Handle.
Remarkably deep R. & f. Struc-
ture lacks standards but the 
presence (albeit rarely) of l.c.
suggests that it is a long-
-established 2ndary wood.
IIII. N. extension of handle.
An elm extension possibly
assisted by planting. Includes
small l.c. stools and is prob-
ably an 18th cent. addition,
V. s. extension of handle.
A typical elm fringe.
VI Pincote.
Could be an ancient wood-
land converted to elm. The
few large ash stools support
this view. Impossible to say
whether it is older than the
Handle (cf Downing Estate Map).
Carb-trees are remarkably common in the woods. Haw-
thorns curiously infrequent.

This remarkable wood is 
certainly old despit its absence
from the 1835 O.S. (as shown by
the large ash stools). Oaks
now rather few but this is
probably from felling this century.

Distribution of coppice very
patchy. Most of the elms are
small, but a few large trees
remain, and these (like the
big cherry) have spreading crowns unlike those of
recent sucker origin.
Nettles generally scarce ex-cept along beck.
Comparable to Overhall in 
many respects, notably the dense 
pure stand of elm, but has
mercury instead of Poa trivialis.

This is almost certainly a
fragment of the medieval Had-
stock Wood.
Wordland structure remark-
able for:
(a) scarcity of l. c. (cf Hardwick).
Such l. c. as there is is apparently
recent. The exception is the
elm coppice, of which the stools 
are large and sometimes
very high. this is fairly contin-
uous along the S. edge, with
a small outlier (a few very
large stools) in the N.
(b) frequency of ULmus probably
glabra).
(e) oaks mostly felled.
Ground vegetation comparable
to Elsworth. Carpet of mercury
(with bluebells instead in places)
with gaps and open patches
on the more sloping parts.


[10320-10321]

These gaps are the site of
occasional patches and
groups of oxlips. Other oxlip
plants occur among the
mercury. Oxlip is never dom-
inant over more than a
few square yards. Plants
saller than in W. Cambs,
poorly flowering. Many in-
fluorescences bitten off high and
gone.
The wood is very dry (cf
Elsworth). Shade fairly dense:
no areas of Deschampsia or
Filipendula.
Coppicing long neglected and
s. c. poles are up to c. 6 in.
diam.
In the S. e. corner is a linear
ditch with water flowing in it
but disappearing in a few
yards.

[10326-10327]

[10328-10329]
Western wood.
The earthworks show
conclusively that this is the medieval Bourne Wood.
Structure is an apparently
even-aged stand of pole
elms (probably from suckers)
with occasional sycamore. Elm
was probably dominant for
many years, as shown by
the substantial submarginal 
strip on the S. side (unless this
is a driftway) and the fur-
ther encroachment beyond
that. No sign of the original
tree species. That the struc-
ture originally was 3-stor-
ied is shown by the few
stools surviving, almost en-
tirely on banks.
The wood is rather dry
except in pockets by the
banks.
Oxlips dominant over the
E. and N. parts of the in-
terior. small plants rather
widely spaced with Poa trivi-
als between. Other woodland
species local, mainly on banks.
The interior is rather
impenetrable except on the E.
because very densely overgrown
with big brables. Most of
the W. part has no O, B, or
M. Oxlip very rare W. of 
the murder bank.
A very few l. c. stools
occur W. of the murder
bank.
Ivy rare.

[10330-10331]

This particular elm grows
fairly closely and suckers
weakly.
Hawthorn remarkably
rare.
No primrose or hybrids.
The surrounding bank is
very massive and imposing
and lacks drainage gaps
except one on the E. To the
En. it now forms the edge
of the wood. The wood
beyond this has been cleared.
The ditch has been cleared
out but the bank not seri-
iously damaged.

Middle wood.
Entirely R. & F. probably of
one system. The W [!!!!]E[!!!!]. (and S. ?.)
boundaries have been found,
the N. perhaps (where the
strip beyond the present sub-
marginal ditch appears to
have no R. & F. ). On the E.
it continues into the Handle.
To the N. and B. W. the
wood abuts on very recently
cleared land and the boun-
dary ditches are modern.
Despite the R. & F. the
structure is much better preser-
ved than in the old wood.
Elm is restructed though
usually dominant where it
occurs. Small numbers of
oak standards. Many ash
& maple stools which vary in
size from one to another of
the areas defined by secon-

[10332]
dary ditches. Hazel regular,
dense in places.
Much scrub particularly
along the ride and in the S.
Hawthorn & blackthorn. 
Rather dry. No water
at present in the furrows;
ride rather wetter.
Ground vegetation much
drier than in the old wood,
from which it is very sharply
cut off at the ditch. Oxlip
is almost absent S. of the
ride.
One primrose-oxlip hybrid
is all that was seen of the
Meyer & Meyer primrose
population. This is shown
N. of the present wood and 
was probablly lost in felling.
