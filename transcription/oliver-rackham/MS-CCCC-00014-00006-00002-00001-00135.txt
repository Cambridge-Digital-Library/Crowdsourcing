The original status of 
the loam area is not clear.
Adamoon (p. 370) says shrubs
were sparse and (Pl. 12) shows

[10272-10273]
no ash. Most of it has 
been replanted for many
years but there is no sign
of any old coppice. Pine
does well here but fails
on most parts of the clay.
Much birch has come
in in "intact" areas, especially
near the loam. All pendula.
The service tree has a 
spreading habit. It is sure-
rounded by a ring of young
trees, up to c. 2 in. diam.,
occur up to c. 5 yards outside
the tree's canopy. This is in
a strip of "intact" woodland
consisting mainly of hazel
coppice.
Campanula trachelium, Pim-
pinella magna, Conopodium, and Galeobdolon
were seen only on and near the 
Mertonage Bank.
Ground is rather wet,
especially in felled areas
where there is standing water.
Adamoon's societies (except
Fragaria) are still very
evident. On the day, Mer-
curialis corresponds to V-VI;
Spiraea to II-III-IV; Spir-
aea-Carex to I. Spiraea-Des-
champsia is a variant of II
still very prominent where
Adamoon described it.
Primroses are associated
particularly with the Mertonage
Bank and perhaps with parts
of the main ride.
Paris is rare.
Birch apparently all pendula.

The ridge-[????]-furrow in the
Lane was discovered by David
Coombe. 4 furrows evenly
spaced. They end to the N.E. at the 
cross ditch and to the S.W.
peter out about loft beyond
the cross ride. A careful
search of the S.W. half of the
Lane failed to find any. [SYMBOL].
The ridges are marked by
abundant primroses and
by big poplars in rows.
A small blind ditch was

[10276-10277]
found in the unridged N.
end of the Lane. 
[DIAG]
Coppicing has reached the
S. end of the hornbeam area.
Maple bleeds very copiously 
when coppiced.
Nickey is reported from Norwich
to have been put outside on April
19.

Eccremocarpos (Market).

and the two Passifloras.

Hatley Cockayne Wood.
I. Main Wood.
Typical 3-storeyed
wood. Rather dry and
with no surface water any-
where at present. A number
of subdividing banks which seem
at present to have no significance,
though the ivy in the region of
wood rather open and ground
reg conbi[????] except in Ia.
[DIAG]
BH is perhaps
suggestive.
