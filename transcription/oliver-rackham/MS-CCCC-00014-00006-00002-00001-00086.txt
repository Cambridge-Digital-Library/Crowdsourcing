One Yates of Gamlingay
was met in the wood,
accompanied by a boy
with a ferret and a sack.
He said he had the ferrett
in the wood. He said he
had many times seen the
herd of 20-30 deer leaving
the wood and crossing fields
to fee. He knew of the
existence of muntjac ("only
about 20 lb weight when
skinned") but said there
were none in the wood.
There were four of
peculiar colours (two white
one red) of which one
had been shot. The
deer had formerly [????]
occasionally taken in
snares at the edge of
the wood, but he did
not approve.
February 14.
Elder becomes very hard
and quite difficult to
saw when dry.
February 15.
The weather is quite
warm.
February 16.
The winter has been
uncommonly dry so far.
February 17.
There is a fine mulberry
tree with a single trunk,
some 30ft high, in Dr
Coombs's garden in Selwyn
Gardens.

Holme Fen.
The whole fen was
cultivated c.1850-c.1870
The Holme Post shows
that about half the
fall in the surface took
place in this period.
Only about 3ft have
disappeared since 1900.
The present vegetation
(except for a few open
areas and a few
[DIAG]
[6948-6949]
small groups of Populus
canadensis, oak, spruce,
[????] is secondary birch
forest. In much of
Stilton Fen, and in scat-
tered areas elsewhere
the trees are small and
closely spaced; but, despite
the apparent even age
of this stand, it is
undoubtedly second-gener-
ation; the stumps of
the first generation (pro-
bably naturally dead)
and an occasional de-
caying survivor are visible.
The bulk of the forest
is, however, more advanced
second-generation, still
quite even-aged though
less so, the trees close,
upright in habit (not
with spreading branches like
pioneers). There are trees
up to 50ft high, with
trunks to 1ft diam
Myrica
Seen in two areas:
1. A small patch S. of
the Holme Post, about
half-way to the great
Moorwi[????]  but W. of a
straight line to it.
About six large bushes
among Salix and small
birches in a small open
area of the forest. Both
sexes. Flowering. It ap-
pears to be severely shaded
and only about half
[6950-6951]
alive.
2. A larger patch
reached by going N.E.
from the peat face
along the bank of the
lode, and turning S.W.
along the path which
opens about 3/4 of the
way to the edge of the
fen. The patch is by
the side of the path
after covering about the
same distance again.
It is associated with
a large round wet
area (with Iris and
Cladium) and perhaps
forms a marginal zone.
Much declining owing
probably to shading by
the forest (the wet area
being free of trees, but
not being large enough
to make a big gap in the
canopy.
1. Pellia epiphylla. Abun-
dant on the peat sides
of the shallow dry ditch D
which borders the railway.
(Fertile, thus not neesiata
nor fabbroniana owing to
perichaetium.) 4
2. Dicranella heteromalla.
Same habitat, Denton Fen
1
3. Aulamnium androgynum
Very abundant generally
on wood, also peat.
[6952-6953]
4. Acrocladium cuspidatum
Dyke D; dried-up
bottom.
5. Bryum capillare. Verti-
cal peat face, ibid 2
6. Mnium hornum. Abun-
dant on peat and at the
bases of trees.
7. Atrichum undulatum.
Abundant and fruiting,
Denton Fen. 3
8. Plagiothecium (denticulatum)
Peat.
9. Orthodontium lineare.
Local.
10. Polytrichum juniperinum
11. Bryum caespiticium.
Tufts under birch. 5
12. Dicranum scoparium.
Generally abundant,
and shows little tendency
to approach D. polysetum,
even on the banks of the
peat-face lode.
13. Pseudoscleropodium purum.
14. Pleurozium schreberi.
15. Thuidium tamariscinum.
16. Polytrichum formosum.

[6954-6955]
Spagnum is said to
occur near the middle
level crossing, but was
looked for in vain.
A large mere so being
dug out mechanically
near the drove between
the level-crossing and
the Holme Post. Part of
it is completed; a
peat surface at about
the present water level
whereon it is hoped that
Sphagnum will become
established. The rest is
much deeper. The
impermeability and strength
of the lower peat is
well illustrated; a
working face is separ-
ated from the main mire
by a baulk of peat
(in situ) only about 2-3fet
wide, but which nevertheless
maintains a difference
of level of several feet
from one side to the other.

Much of the peat
excavated is being sacked
up and taken away.
There is a vast
amount of identifiable
plant remains in the peat,
especially great masses
of perfectly preserved bryo-
phytes. The following
objects are notable (in ad-
dition to a number of
others given to Dr Jim
[6956-6957]
Dickson):
1.2. Rhizomes of Phrag-
mites and probably Scheuch
zeria.
3. Red rhizomes (Cladium?)
4.
To the N. of Holme Fen,
the lake deposits of Trun-
dle Mere appear to be
all peat, unlike the silt
of Whittlesey Mere and
the Red Mere.
Two hares were seen
chasing each other and
skipping about on Trundle
Mere.
A red fruiting Arcyria
was found in [????]
Fen.
February 21.
A bowl of yellow
crocuses was brought
to Cambridge to my col-
lege rooms.
February 22.
The crocuses are
[6958-6959]
very quick in responding
to sudden changes of
temperature. They remain
closed at c.50 F (guessed)
but at c. 65 F. they
open fully in about
a quarter of an hour.
The closing reaction
takes about an hour
or more.
February 23.
Individual crocus
flowers do not appar-
ently open more than
twice or possibly three
times before withering.
February 24
As the crocuses wither,
their place is taken
by new flowers which
open in basipetal suc-
cession on the stem.
February 25.
Norwich.
1. "The earth temperature
is about 40 F. everywhere,
under the trees by the
front hedge being very
slightly warmer than
elsewhere."
2. "To-day turned out
very sunny (if not warm)
and bees began to fly."
3. "Nickey.....began to
scrab in his box."
February 26
The mountain-ash tree
near the pear tree was
moved to the artichoke plot
