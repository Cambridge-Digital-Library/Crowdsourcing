One Yates of Gamlingay
was met in the wood,
accompanied by a boy
with a ferret and a sack.
He said he had the ferrett
in the wood. He said he
had many times seen the
herd of 20-30 deer leaving
the wood and crossing fields
to fee. He knew of the
existence of muntjac ("only
about 20 lb weight when
skinned") but said there
were none in the wood.
There were four of
peculiar colours (two white
one red) of which one
had been shot. The
deer had formerly [????]
occasionally taken in
snares at the edge of
the wood, but he did
not approve.
February 14.
Elder becomes very hard
and quite difficult to
saw when dry.
February 15.
The weather is quite
warm.
February 16.
The winter has been
uncommonly dry so far.
February 17.
There is a fine mulberry
tree with a single trunk,
some 30ft high, in Dr
Coombs's garden in Selwyn
Gardens.
February 18.

February 20.
Holme Fen.
The whole fen was
cultivated c.1850-c.1870
The Holme Post shows
that about half the
fall in the surface took
place in this period.
Only about 3ft have
disappeared since 1900.
The present vegetation
(except for a few open
areas and a few
[DIAG]
[6948-6949]
small groups of Populus
canadensis, oak, spruce,
[????] is secondary birch
forest. In much of
Stilton Fen, and in scat-
tered areas elsewhere
the trees are small and
closely spaced; but, despite
the apparent even age
of this stand, it is
undoubtedly second-gener-
ation; the stumps of
the first generation (pro-
bably naturally dead)
and an occasional de-
caying survivor are visible.
The bulk of the forest
is, however, more advanced
second-generation, still
quite even-aged though
less so, the trees close,
upright in habit (not
with spreading branches like
pioneers). There are trees
up to 50ft high, with
trunks to 1ft diam
Myrica
Seen in two areas:
1. A small patch S. of
the Holme Post, about
half-way to the great
Moorwi[????]  but W. of a
straight line to it.
About six large bushes
among Salix and small
birches in a small open
area of the forest. Both
sexes. Flowering. It ap-
pears to be severely shaded
and only about half
[6950-6951]
alive.
2. A larger patch
reached by going N.E.
from the peat face
along the bank of the
lode, and turning S.W.
along the path which
opens about 3/4 of the
way to the edge of the
fen. The patch is by
the side of the path
after covering about the
same distance again.
It is associated with
a large round wet
area (with Iris and
Cladium) and perhaps
forms a marginal zone.
Much declining owing
probably to shading by
the forest (the wet area
being free of trees, but
not being large enough
to make a big gap in the
canopy.
1. Pellia epiphylla. Abun-
dant on the peat sides
of the shallow dry ditch D
which borders the railway.
(Fertile, thus not neesiata
nor fabbroniana owing to
perichaetium.) 4
2. Dicranella heteromalla.
Same habitat, Denton Fen
1
3. Aulamnium androgynum
Very abundant generally
on wood, also peat.
[6952-6953]
4. Acrocladium cuspidatum
Dyke D; dried-up
bottom.
5. Bryum capillare. Verti-
cal peat face, ibid 2
6. Mnium hornum. Abun-
dant on peat and at the
bases of trees.
7. Atrichum undulatum.
Abundant and fruiting,
Denton Fen. 3
8. Plagiothecium (denticulatum)
Peat.
9. Orthodontium lineare.
Local.
10. Polytrichum juniperinum
11. Bryum caespiticium.
Tufts under birch. 5
12. Dicranum scoparium.
Generally abundant,
and shows little tendency
to approach D. polysetum,
even on the banks of the
peat-face lode.
13. Pseudoscleropodium purum.
14. Pleurozium schreberi.
15. Thuidium tamariscinum.
16. Polytrichum formosum.
[DIAG]
[6954-6955]
Spagnum is said to
occur near the middle
level crossing, but was
looked for in vain.
A large mere so being
dug out mechanically
near the drove between
the level-crossing and
the Holme Post. Part of
it is completed; a
peat surface at about
the present water level
whereon it is hoped that
Sphagnum will become
established. The rest is
much deeper. The
impermeability and strength
of the lower peat is
well illustrated; a
working face is separ-
ated from the main mire
by a baulk of peat
(in situ) only about 2-3fet
wide, but which nevertheless
maintains a difference
of level of several feet
from one side to the other.
PHOTO.
Much of the peat
excavated is being sacked
up and taken away.
There is a vast
amount of identifiable
plant remains in the peat,
especially great masses
of perfectly preserved bryo-
phytes. The following
objects are notable (in ad-
dition to a number of
others given to Dr Jim
[6956-6957]
Dickson):
1.2. Rhizomes of Phrag-
mites and probably Scheuch
zeria.
3. Red rhizomes (Cladium?)
4.
To the N. of Holme Fen,
the lake deposits of Trun-
dle Mere appear to be
all peat, unlike the silt
of Whittlesey Mere and
the Red Mere.
Two hares were seen
chasing each other and
skipping about on Trundle
Mere.
A red fruiting Arcyria
was found in [????]
Fen.
February 21.
A bowl of yellow
crocuses was brought
to Cambridge to my col-
lege rooms.
February 22.
The crocuses are
[6958-6959]
very quick in responding
to sudden changes of
temperature. They remain
closed at c.50 F (guessed)
but at c. 65 F. they
open fully in about
a quarter of an hour.
The closing reaction
takes about an hour
or more.
February 23.
Individual crocus
flowers do not appar-
ently open more than
twice or possibly three
times before withering.
February 24
As the crocuses wither,
their place is taken
by new flowers which
open in basipetal suc-
cession on the stem.
February 25.
Norwich.
1. "The earth temperature
is about 40 F. everywhere,
under the trees by the
front hedge being very
slightly warmer than
elsewhere."
2. "To-day turned out
very sunny (if not warm)
and bees began to fly."
3. "Nickey.....began to
scrab in his box."
February 26
The mountain-ash tree
near the pear tree was
moved to the artichoke plot
(Norwich)
[6960-6961]
February 27
Devil's Ditch
The first 200 yards
N.W. of the Newmarket
Road gap.
1. [????]idium molluscum
Abundant.
2. Campylium chrysophyllum
Abundant, epsecially among
chalk rubble. On the N.E.
side, it grows in great
profusion in a situation
rather shaded by gra[????]
3. Camptotheaum lutescens.
4. Pseudoscleropodium purum.
5.6.7. Bryum spp. apparently
lacking gemmae on rhizoids.
Frequent in short turf and 
on bare patches. 13 14 15
8. Weisia microstoma. Abun-
dant both on the [????]itch
and on the parallel bank
some 20 yards away to
the N.E. (herein after referred
to as the race-course bank).
10 12
9. Hypnum lacunosum.
10. Phascum curvicolle
Abundant in open patches. 16
11. Seligena calcarea. Abun-
dant on chalk rubble
sometimes quite small 17
[6962-6963]
blocks); especially N.E. side.
12. Bryum rubens. Scarce,
N.E. side. (Probably right;
brownish crimson mulberry
gemmae). Also on racecourse bank. 11
13. Dicranella varia. Frequent.
14. Pottia recta. Abundant,
including racecourse bank.
15. Weissia crispa. Racecourse
bank. 8
16. Bryum capillare.
17. Tortella inflexa. Chalk
lumps; the commonest sp.
thereon [????] the S.W. side. 18
18. Fissidens bryoides. Fre-
quent; F. adianthrides not certainly seen. 7
The race-course
bank has been burnt,
probably a few weeks
ago. The fire has
scorched and killed about
2/3 of the earth mosses,
but the others (those in
hollows in the ground and
between chalk blocks) have
escaped and are flour-
ishing in the absence of
the taller vegetation. The
Devil's Ditch itself is said
to be periodically fired
by the Jockey Club, and
this probably keeps down
[6964-6965]
the bushes.
All the dead stems of
Centaurea nigra have
not been consumed or
even singed by this fire.
Chalk-pit at Brinkley
A smallish pit isolated
in a field. Sides some 30ft
high, vertical for the most
part, with shallow [????]
in the base. Contains many
old elders. In the flat
bottom are a lime tree
and a giant horse-chestnut.
1. Tortula muralis. 19
2. Tortula marginata.
Together on large chalk
lumps on the low cliff
below the ramp which
forms the entry of the
pit. Mainly T. muralis.
3. Metzgeria furcata. Scarce,
elders.
4. Orthotrichum affine. Abun-
dant, elders 20
5. Frullaria dilatata? Lime
tree (peculiar under-lobes.)
21
Cryphaea is said to
grow on the elders, but was
not seen.
February 28
Aconite Wood, Bourne Bridge.
[6966-6967]
The aconites appear
to have extended slightly
in the past two years.
There are more isolated
patches scattered in the
part of the wood away
from the road.
Violets were seen, but
no signs of flowers.
Ganoderma applanatum
On the shell of the
great poplar. Two sparo-
phores measured thus:
1. 12 1/2 " x 6"; last year's
zone 9 1/2" x 5". The largest
one inside the hollow
trunk.
2. 12"x7 1/2". On the outside
of the trunk, towards the
river.
Polyporus hirsutus. One
on ash, about 15" x 7".
THe tree, a large one,
has recently collapsed
across the river. Rot
soft, brown. Apparently
entered by a snag.

(apparently damaged by
frost) shows a peculiar
teratomorphic bract neaer
the top of the pedicel;
one side of this [DIAG]
is petaloid and
bears
a tubular
petaloid
outgrowth with a corona -

Daphne laureola is
frequent in this pit.
BADGERS.
[DIAG]
A Group of c.15 holes, of
which c.2 appear to be
occupied. Much activity at
the N. end of the group.
B Much activity (digging,
disturbance of top-soil,
etc.) under hawthorn scrub.
Latrine pits.
C Most prominent of the
many badger tracks in
the pit. There may well
be a large sett concealed
somewhere. Most of the pit
[6976-6977]
is full of hawthorn
scrub, very dense and
impenetrable. There is
some elder near the

Harlton Pit. [DIAG]
D: old site still
disused.
E: latrine pits.
F: 5 holes in
low chalk
cliff and
rubble. Two
with fresh excava-
tion one with bedding.
Mixed scrube inclu-
ding eldge and
hawthorn.
G: large area of
slope under elm
and other trees. c.30
holes mostly blocked or
disused, with little sign of
activity.
H: group of c.9 holes in
steep slope under trees, quite
disused.
I: one fresh hole. Hornbeam.
J: three used holes, the
rest filled in.
Daphne laureola
occurs abundantly along
the belt (and occasion-
ally along the Mare Way).
A few small to medium-
-sized hornbeams occur
in the belt.
There is a young
yew in the belt.
[6978-6979]
Belt along the Mare Way.
In this belt, between
the junction with the
belt leading to Harlton

recently, about 1/4 of the
blocked holes being reopened.
Paper bags appear to
have been used for
blocking the holes. Some
of these carried labels of
