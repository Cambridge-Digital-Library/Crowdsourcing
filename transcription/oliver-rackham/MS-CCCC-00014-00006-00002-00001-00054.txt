The following list includes
some of the plants of
the great landslide at 
Windy Corner, Niton.
It runs from the foot of 
Gore Cliff to the sea,
about 3/8 mile long, and
is about 1/2 mile wide.
It is very unstable,
the path through it being
ill-defined and almost
impassable. The soil is 
a heterogeneous mixture
of various strata, a
slippery black clay
predominating.

(I) Mud surfaces bear-
ing a rather incomplete 
vegetation cover. Very
wet owing to many small streams, forming
small lakes in places.

(II) Scrub relicts, main-
ly in masses of green 
sand, There are no 
trees in this landslip
and few bushes. Large
bushes are all dead,
but smaller ones 
survive on islands
of the origina talus.

(III) Small areas of chalk 
grassland. These remain
coherent and retain
their flora, but may 
get overturned or buried
on the way down. No
attempt is made to include all the spp.

The frequencies given 
refer to the whole area
not to the individual
classes.

1. Armillaria mellea.
In Whit well under-
cliff, many sycamores
grow in the woods. Some 
are dead with suspicious
symptoms. Good rhizomorphs
were seen on one 
stump, and a definite rot
in another.
