Marsh adjoining
over-grazed
Huge anthills - to 2'2 dia

The marah has been in-
vaded from the W. by the wood,
which now has a clearly
defined scrub margin.
[DIAG]

[12636-12637]
2636
  The marsh has several
shallow grips at right angles
to the beck.  It has been
overgrazed and badly poached
by cattle in places, but
is clearly old grassland rich
in species.  Rush tufts
not too abundant yet.
  A flat wood extending
right to the edge of a rather
sharp little valley.  Undoubtedly
primary, probably formerly exten-
ding further to the N.E.
  Soil rather gravelley but
vegetation suggests it its cal-
careous.
  A typical and somewhat
unremarkable boulder-clay wood.
2637
The replanting of most of
the wood has severely dam-
aged its vegetation, and the
adjoining marsh and the scrub
strip along the western earth-
work are now probably of
greater conservation value,
1. Very typical 3-layered struc-
ture:  like Hayley but apparently
less hawthorn.  Large proportion of
sallow in SC, at least locally.
2. Good stocking of oaks.
3. Ground vegetaton after
coppicing is chiefly of the 
tall-herb vsriety:  Deschampsia,
Angelica, Arrhenatherium co-dom-
inant.  Similar but nore
dense in areas planted after

[12638-12639]
2638
coppicing, where there are in
addition patches od Chamaenerion
and Calamagrostis.  Brambles
mainly unimportant.
4. Fine western boundary bank,
with 3 large pollard oaks.
5. Occasional holly saplings.
6. Hawthorn mainly monogyna.
7. Melick occasional on former
margin.
\8. Ivy marginal:  distribution
within wood unkn own.
9. No evidence of decalcification.
10. No bracken.

  Rawhall is an outwardly
undistinguished 19th cent. farm.

North Elmham Great Wood.
  The road from the N. is a 
wide grass-lined lane between
tall belts of a great variety
of native and exotic deciduous
trees.  It ends in a keeper's 
cottage of c. 1900 inhabited by
two friendly elderly women.
  There are some large clear-
ings in the wood, pasturing
sheep and cattle.  The grass is
sown. Numerous middle-aged 
oaks and large overgrown ash 
stools remain, giving
a park-like
appearance.  [SYMBOL] 3.

H is similar to G, with small
ash stools and some bracken.
There is a small self-con-
tained elm area.
2655
Note on ash stools
In B, C and the S. part
of D, there is a curious type of
ash stool with a high base
carrying living poles and
also a single rotten stump
of a standard ash.  The stump
[SYMBOL] 6       has sometimes
[DIAG]           decayed com-
                 pletely leaving
                 a hole.  It
                 is usually
 about 1 1/4 ft dia and very
 roughly the standard was
 80 years old when felled.
 These are similar in size
 and shape to a normal
 large ash stool and would be 
 difficult to distinguish from

[12654-12655]
2654
such if the stump were
rotted further.
These stools are clearly
derived from standards.  Were
these maidens or promoted
stools?  Almost certainly the latter
because
1.  Examples exist ([SYMBOL]) of stools
much larger than the stump
[DIAG]           and having
                 an outlying
                 portion.  This
                 presumably 
existed before the stool was
promoted, and was retained
when the standard was felled.
2.  It is difficult otherwise to
understand why the standards
should not have vbeen felled at
2655
grounbd level.
3.  The base is knobbly as
of a promoted standard.
4. It is doubtful whether 
felled maidens woud coppice on
such a large scale.

'Normal' stools pod vasrious
sizes exist in E. and N. part of D,
and small numbers of these
are isolated in the "parkland"
pasture assarts.

than F.  The two boundary
banks are similar, steep with
rounded profiles.  That to G
is broader and lower.  Both

[DIAG]

have large ash and maple
stools on them.  F appears to
carry the remains of a hedge
(cnfirming the late date for
the encroachment).  There is
presumably some connexion with
Elmham Park.
2659
Prunus Padus
  One fine tree (p. 2644) which
has recently split asunder as
a result of narrow crotches with
included roots [SYMBOL] 5
   Other small trees scattered
in the S. part of the wood, but
only a minute fraction of the 
shrub-layer, and never regularly
coppiced.
Clearings.
   The women say this was
begun c. 1956 at the N. end.
The S. clearing was made c.
1961.  The great triple oak was
left, "one for each of us three
sisters" in the S. clearing
(p. 2645).

[12660-12661]
2660
Badgers  A sett with 8 holes
was found just inside the
W. margin, in the marginal ride
just inside the boundary
hedge.  Probably currently
used, but little fresh excava-
tion;  no bedding seen.
   A fine sett of only one hole 
on the N.E. side (p.   )

  A curiously dull woodland
floristically, but perhaps inter-
esting historically.  Probably
primary:  its poioir flora may be
in some way related to the
dense nearly even-aged
coppice and the light soil.
1.  Typical 3-layered structure.
2661
Standards poor and re-
duced by thinning and fel-
ling.  LC rather thin over
most of the wood, but
on the NE side there are
areas where it is dominant
and there is little SC at all.
Such ash areas (B) are not
always separated by earth-
works from more typical
hazel areas, though the trans-
ition is abrupt.  Apart from
these smallish areas there is
very little variation in wood-
land structure and the cleared
areas may well have been
the same, judging by the trees
remaining in them.
2.  Soil wherever seen is
