road is in the bank.  Ploughed
out ditch in a field immed-
iately W.
  Gravel soil.
   Line of broom bushes on

Numerous oak stds
Ivy - ab in S. boundary & W.

Planted with beech & Scots.

Oaks cover c. 50%, very
wide crowns, uneven aged

Not much LC - all ash?
SC about 3/4 sallow, 1/4 hazel.

Light variant of boulder 
clay with much gravel.

Hornbeam - one large

Prunus cerosus, hornbeam,
mercury in hedge opposite
wood by road.  Hedge itself
cut down and difficult to
determine woody plants.

Marsh adjoining
over-grazed
Huge anthills - to 2'2 dia
& 1  ft high

The marah has been in-
vaded from the W. by the wood,
which now has a clearly
defined scrub margin.

2636
  The marsh has several
shallow grips at right angles
to the beck.  It has been
overgrazed and badly poached
by cattle in places, but
is clearly old grassland rich
in species.  Rush tufts
not too abundant yet.
  A flat wood extending
right to the edge of a rather
sharp little valley.  Undoubtedly
primary, probably formerly exten-
ding further to the N.E.
  Soil rather gravelley but
vegetation suggests it its cal-
careous.
  A typical and somewhat
unremarkable boulder-clay wood.
2637
The replanting of most of
the wood has severely dam-
aged its vegetation, and the
adjoining marsh and the scrub
strip along the western earth-
work are now probably of
greater conservation value,
1. Very typical 3-layered struc-
ture:  like Hayley but apparently
less hawthorn.  Large proportion of
sallow in SC, at least locally.
2. Good stocking of oaks.
3. Ground vegetaton after
coppicing is chiefly of the 
tall-herb vsriety:  Deschampsia,
Angelica, Arrhenatherium co-dom-
inant.  Similar but nore
dense in areas planted after

[12638-12639]

coppicing, where there are in
addition patches od Chamaenerion
and Calamagrostis.  Brambles
mainly unimportant.
4. Fine western boundary bank,
with 3 large pollard oaks.
5. Occasional holly saplings.
6. Hawthorn mainly monogyna.
7. Melick occasional on former
margin.
\8. Ivy marginal:  distribution
within wood unkn own.
9. No evidence of decalcification.
10. No bracken.
2639
  Rawhall is an outwardly
undistinguished 19th cent. farm.

North Elmham Great Wood.
  The road from the N. is a 
wide grass-lined lane between
tall belts of a great variety
of native and exotic deciduous
trees.  It ends in a keeper's 
cottage of c. 1900 inhabited by
two friendly elderly women.
  There are some large clear-
ings in the wood, pasturing
sheep and cattle.  The grass is
sown. Numerous middle-aged 
oaks and large overgrown ash 
stools remain, giving
a park-like
appearance.  [SYMBOL] 3.
