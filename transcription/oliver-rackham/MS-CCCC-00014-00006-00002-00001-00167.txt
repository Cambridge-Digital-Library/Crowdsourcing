Marsh adjoining
over-grazed
Huge anthills - to 2'2 dia

The marah has been in-
vaded from the W. by the wood,
which now has a clearly
defined scrub margin.
[DIAG]

[12636-12637]
2636
  The marsh has several
shallow grips at right angles
to the beck.  It has been
overgrazed and badly poached
by cattle in places, but
is clearly old grassland rich
in species.  Rush tufts
not too abundant yet.
  A flat wood extending
right to the edge of a rather
sharp little valley.  Undoubtedly
primary, probably formerly exten-
ding further to the N.E.
  Soil rather gravelley but
vegetation suggests it its cal-
careous.
  A typical and somewhat
unremarkable boulder-clay wood.
2637
The replanting of most of
the wood has severely dam-
aged its vegetation, and the
adjoining marsh and the scrub
strip along the western earth-
work are now probably of
greater conservation value,
1. Very typical 3-layered struc-
ture:  like Hayley but apparently
less hawthorn.  Large proportion of
sallow in SC, at least locally.
2. Good stocking of oaks.
3. Ground vegetaton after
coppicing is chiefly of the 
tall-herb vsriety:  Deschampsia,
Angelica, Arrhenatherium co-dom-
inant.  Similar but nore
dense in areas planted after

[12638-12639]
2638
coppicing, where there are in
addition patches of Chamaenerio
and Calamagrostis.  Brambles
mainly unimportant.
4. Fine western boundary bank,
with 3 large pollard oaks.
5. Occasional holly saplings.
6. Hawthorn mainly monogyna.
7. Melick occasional on former
margin.
8. Ivy marginal:  distribution
within wood unknown.
9. No evidence of decalcification.
10. No bracken.
2639
  Rawhall is an outwardly
undistinguished 19th cent. farm.

North Elmham Great Wood.
  The road from the N. is a 
wide grass-lined lane between
tall belts of a great variety
of native and exotic deciduous
trees.  It ends in a keeper's 
cottage of c. 1900 inhabited by
two friendly elderly women.
  There are some large clear-
ings in the wood, pasturing
sheep and cattle.  The grass is
sown. Numerous middle-aged 
oaks and large overgrown ash 
stools remain, giving
a park-like
appearance.  [SYMBOL] 3.

H is similar to G, with small
ash stools and some bracken.
There is a small self-con-
tained elm area.
2655
Note on ash stools
In B, C and the S. part
of D, there is a curious type of
ash stool with a high base
carrying living poles and
also a single rotten stump
of a standard ash.  The stump
[SYMBOL] 6       has sometimes
[DIAG]           decayed com-
                 pletely leaving
                 a hole.  It
                 is usually
 about 1 1/4 ft dia and very
 roughly the standard was
 80 years old when felled.
 These are similar in size
 and shape to a normal
 large ash stool and would be 
 difficult to distinguish from

[12654-12655]
2654
such if the stump were
rotted further.
These stools are clearly
derived from standards.  Were
these maidens or promoted
stools?  Almost certainly the latter
because
1.  Examples exist ([SYMBOL]) of stools
much larger than the stump
[DIAG]           and having
                 an outlying
                 portion.  This
                 presumably 
existed before the stool was
promoted, and was retained
when the standard was felled.
2.  It is difficult otherwise to
understand why the standards
should not have been felled at
2655
ground level.
3.  The base is knobbly as
of a promoted standard.
4. It is doubtful whether 
felled maidens would coppice on
such a large scale.

'Normal' stools pod various
sizes exist in E. and N. part of D,
and small numbers of these
are isolated in the "parkland"
pasture assarts.

than F.  The two boundary
banks are similar, steep with
rounded profiles.  That to G
is broader and lower.  Both

[DIAG]

have large ash and maple
stools on them.  F appears to
carry the remains of a hedge
(cnfirming the late date for
the encroachment).  There is
presumably some connexion with
Elmham Park.
2659
Prunus Padus
  One fine tree (p. 2644) which
has recently split asunder as
a result of narrow crotches with
included roots [SYMBOL] 5
   Other small trees scattered
in the S. part of the wood, but
only a minute fraction of the 
shrub-layer, and never regularly
coppiced.
Clearings.
   The women say this was
begun c. 1956 at the N. end.
The S. clearing was made c.
1961.  The great triple oak was
left, "one for each of us three
sisters" in the S. clearing
(p. 2645).

[12660-12661]
2660
Badgers  A sett with 8 holes
was found just inside the
W. margin, in the marginal ride
just inside the boundary
hedge.  Probably currently
used, but little fresh excava-
tion;  no bedding seen.
   A fine sett of only one hole 
on the N.E. side (p.   )

  A curiously dull woodland
floristically, but perhaps inter-
esting historically.  Probably
primary:  its poor flora may be
in some way related to the
dense nearly even-aged
coppice and the light soil.
1.  Typical 3-layered structure.
2661
Standards poor and re-
duced by thinning and fel-
ling.  LC rather thin over
most of the wood, but
on the NE side there are
areas where it is dominant
and there is little SC at all.
Such ash areas (B) are not
always separated by earth-
works from more typical
hazel areas, though the trans-
ition is abrupt.  Apart from
these smallish areas there is
very little variation in wood-
land structure and the cleared
areas may well have been
the same, judging by the trees
remaining in them.
2.  Soil wherever seen is

[12662-12663]
2662
sandy, the lightest of all the
"boulder-clay" woods. Very dry
indeed.  Little evidence of acidi-
ficationn:  bracken very local.
3.  Boundary banks usually
slight.  That to the W. is a
remarkable straight hawthorn
hedge, evidently fairly recent;
the former wood outline can 
probably be traced in field
boundaries between it and the
beck.  Banks to the N.E. are
the only massive ones.
4. Prunus padus rare.
5. Holly rare, only as sapling.
6. Agrimonia odorata.
7.  Ash stools often of a
peculiar type derived from
ex-coppice standards and
2663
perhaps considerably larger
in diameter than their age
suggests.
8.  Scattered elm areas, at
least one of long standing
and with a mixture of elms.
9.  Ground vegetation very
poor in cover and species.
Mainly mercury, cover usu-
ally thin, plants badly wilted
almost throughout.  Nothing
wetter than Zone 4.
10.  Numerous pits which ap-
pear to be usually dry.
11.  Apparently free of internal
earthworks.
12.  Very long uncoppiced.
13.  Rather old and successful
conifer plantations.

[12664-12665]
2664
14.  Interesting sequence of
secondary woodland on the N.E.
side, and in the handle.
2665
October 18.
  About 2/3 of the New
Court lawn is severely af-
fected by Fusarium Oxysponum.
The grass is yellow, with
occasional green shoots in some
places but elsewhere none.
It is affected in large conflu-
ent patches.
  The disease is said to have
been promoted by still humid
days such as there have been
recently.

  This appears to be the end
of a Deschampsia phase.
  Note how poor years 1967
and 1969 are in both cases.
Growth this year on the 1969
plot was good.
  Leaves are still green on
[12668-12669]
2668
ash & hazel coppice up to 3
years old, coloured and falling
on older coppice.
  A deer was seen about
50 yards from the coppicing
party (not using the chain saw)
by the S.E. main ride.
  About 1/5 of the coppice was
cut.  A belt about 40 ft wide
is being left round the Round-
about, and also the trees and
stools actually on the S.E. Ride
ditch.
  There are about 12 aspens
close together on the N.E.
margin of the plot.  Some are
dead with Armillaria symptoms.
The living ones always turn
out to have a rotten heart
2669
in the top half, extending
to the crown and branch snags
but never to the ground.  Wood
fairly hard, wet, golden to dark
brown in colour, very patchy,
sometimes with radial "fringes"
in section.  Smell sour, like wet
wood in horse-chestnut.  Often
an apparently sound tree is
entirely affected except for about
3/8" of sound wood.  Occasionally
the affected zone reaches the
surface and tracts of bark are
dead.  Crowns healthy, leaves not
falling prematurely.
   2 oak seedlings were found
in the 1970 plot and one
on the other side of the main
ride apposite the 1969 - 70 boun

 Fistuline hepatica.  A fine sporo-
 phore at ground level on the
 S.W. side of the old hedgerow
 oak nearest the level crossing.

   The Lejeunea stool ash is
 not to be cut.
    About a stone of acorns were
 collected, mainly from rides. They
 vary in size but are usually
 large and fat and apparently
 good, though many turn out to
 be damaged inside.
   No hazel-nuts seen.

  The Ipomoea has not 
flowered recently although there
are still some unopened buds.
