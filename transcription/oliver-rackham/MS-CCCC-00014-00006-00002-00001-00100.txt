Hayley Wood cont.
It must be concluded
that this part of the Ditch
who dug little different
from its present size, viz
9ft wide and c. 1 1/2 ft deep.
6.6.66.
The New Court Lawn is
at least half covered by
Poa annua, which competes
successfully with the fine
Festuca supposed to be there.
June 7.
Mrs. Commbe's Ipomaea
was put in a large tub of
compost on the verandah.
June 8
Photographs were taken
of the three groups of decrepit
horse-chestnuts in Leckhampton.

June 9.
Heracleum mantegazzianum
is flowering in Leckhampton.
June 10.
Rabbits are reported to
canoe trouble in Leckhampton.
June 11.
Madingley Wood (Joan Wilson).
Ant-hills, long extinct,
are still visible as small mounds
of earth under hawthorn
scrub in the N.W. field.
Impatiens parviflora is
coming up from seed on
the site of last year's ex-
periments in both the
small cleaning (where it did
not occur last year) and
the large clearing. Mercury
and nettles (cut down

8039
last year) have returned
with reduced density in the 
small clearning. Mercury has 
hardly recurred at all
in the part of the large
clearning which was puddled
by excessive trampling.

1. Pleurotus sapidus. On
elm logs by the N. ride.

2. Ganoderma applanatum. On
a beech planted in the
belt along the road (old
wood).

Oak: dominant. Many
small and medium (to
Hayley Wood average). None
large. Few stumps (one
at A). Mostly 4" - 12" diam.
No evidence of coppicing
(of Eversden). A region of
young oaks at the extreme
W.
Ash: many pole-sized and 
medium. Lottle old coppice
(but including one large
stool with 12 big pole at
B).
Maple: abundant, mostly
small and apparently maiden.
Elm: two areas. Rather
dense stands, but mixed
with other trees (intermed-
iate netween Hayley and

[8044-8045]
8044
Buff in this respect). Some
in the W. area is apparently
old coppice, mixed with pole ash.
Hazel: not very abundant;
no sign of copplice stools.
IvyL occasional on trees,
none on the ground.
PoplarL none.
Prurius spinosa: marginal.

Ground vegetation.
Knapwell Wood appears
to have been drained by
a network of ditches (now
disused). It is much lighter
than Hayley, and rather
drier although flat. The ab-
sence of a continuous
coppice storey greatly in-
creases the light.

8045
Zone 2 is characterized by
Filipendula which grows
very tall. Cornus is high.
Zones 3 & 4 are almost
absent. Bluebell is almost
entirely marginal (Zone 5).
Mercury (Zone 6) covers
most of the wood. It
is frequently an understorey
to luxuriant Rubus caesius.
Deschampsia is scarce.
Most of the Primula in
the wood is elatior, as
judged by the leaves and
the occasional old infl.
But in the mercury 
areas, Primulas are abundant
mixed with weaker mercury
and growing on paths.
Some at any rate of this

[8046-8047]
8046
is P. elatior, but some
leaves are characteristic
of the hybrid.
Galium aparine is locally
co-dominant with Mercury.
The Heracleum of the
wood is H. angustifolium.
Möhringia trinervia is
locally abundant. [no!]
There are two nettle
areas (besides the marginal
ditch); one contains a few
elders.

3.Polyphones squamosus New
sporophores on ash.

This wood is remarkable
for its drainage, the ab-
sence of coppice, and the

8047

small size of the standards.

Overhall Grove (joan Wilson).
The badger holes on the
moated mound have not been
reopened.
The great set on the
inner ditch has been further
extended. Claw marks are
visible in great numbers.
Elders round the site are
used for scratching.
The nettles are now
6ft high over much of the
area.
Elm is dominant over
the whole wood, except the 
part S. of the Red Well.
There is some [????]pole-sized[????]
ash in the bottom of the

[8048-8049]
8048
wood. Maple is scarce. Oaks are few in the bottom.
The wet wood at the
bottom is dominated by Solan-
um dulcamara. This was
wilting, apparently from a
sun-fleck earlier in the
day. Ranunculus repens 
is co-dominant.
There is neither coppice
nor ivy in this wood.

Mosquitoes are numerous
and fierce in Knapwell and 
Overhall.
The elms in Overhall
and in the lower part of
Madingley both appear to
be carpinifolia.

8049
Trifolium micranthum is
abundant (along with T.
dubium) in King's College
in the lawn strip along K.P.
