Recorded as hazel if of stool 
habit, otherwise number & 
girth of stems.
  Other species: usually 
recorded girth of each stem.
"Small" means too small to

  Wrest Park, Silsoe
  (conference)
  Mistletoe is very abun-
dant on the limes all over the 
Wrest Park estate - usually
not  more than 6 bushes 
per tree.
  Most of the limes, oaks, 
horse-chestnuts, and other
park trees at Wrest Park
are stag-headed or in some 
cases severely died-back.
The site is in a shallow 
valley and drainage may be
a factor. 
Many of the limes at
Wrest Park have large
knobs and bosses on the 
branches,usually at a 
crook in a branch.

Trials of the new motor-mower. 
  The mower was tried in 
the cross-roads glade and
taken up and down the
main glade. It cuts anything
up to 1/2 in. diam. and 
can be made to cut within
about 1 1/2 in. of the ground
if this is level. It gets 
easily through tall vegetation
and drags its way through
Rubus Caesius. 
  The whole of the cross-
[9834-9835]
- roads glade was cut ex-
cept the back portion of the 
S. quadrant. About 6ft
width of the main glade 
was cut. 
  A long-leafed form of Salix
atrocinerea occurs in the N.
quadrant of the cross-roads. 
Rusty hairs conspicuous.
November 4 (from p. 9807)
  The Leckhampton copper
beech produced a good crop
of nuts, many of which con-
tained embryos. A vast number 
were eaten by a squirrel which
sat in the tree and went 
through one cupule after an-
other, tearing them to bits.

  Ivy soon grows over the new
corrugated fibre-glass roof of
the Leckhampton Summer-
house, even though it finds 
little footing for the aerial roots. 
November 19 (from p. 9832)
  The Leckhampton Wisteria has
made very little growth this year. 
November 20 (from p. 9832)
  The Akebia at the Botany 
School produced a  few ripe fruits
this year.
November 21. (from p. 9832)
  The transplanted Portugal laurel
at the Botany School has suffered
little obvious damage because
of continued watering with a 
hose. 
November 23.
  Akebia is now shedding 
its leaves.
November 24.
  Operations in the Hayley Wood 
have been postponed and the
Wood closed beacuse of the 
foot-&-mouth epidemic.

  A geranium plant, grown 
on from a discarded bedding

December 3.
The Clematis, Passiflora,

  The transplanted Portugal 
Laurel shows signs of 
[9840-9841]
drying-out in some of its leaves.
December 5.
  A few bulbs are just showing 
through the earth.
December 6. 
  Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus
is now very luxuriant in the
long grass at Leckhampton. 
December 7.
  Bowiea volubilis (in the
temperate house at Bot. Gard.)
is a curious plant with a 
tuberous base from which
arise at certain seasons the
immensely branched and some-
what tangle inflorescence
branches, most of which are
green and sterile and form
the entire photosynethetic system
of the plant, whose leaves are
rudimentary. It is possibly
related to Dr Bainbridge's
blue Scilla-like plant with a 
very complex branched inflores-
cence, but this had normal
radical leaves as well. 
December 8. 
  A very severe frost has
frozen the Leckhampton pool.
  The Passiflorae, Eccremocanpos,
and the Clematis have been moved
indoors for the while. 
December 9.
  The frost continues and 
Queen's Ditch is frozen over.

  No sign of flooding in
the Gipping valley.
December 11.
Buff Wood (Dr Coombe).
  Measurements were made
of the growth of hazel at the 
points (X) for inclusion in the 
management plan. The
height increase is clearly
related to the presence of
canopy gaps. All the recently
coppiced areas have too 
many sucker poles or large
coppice poles to permit good 
hazel growth except where there
is a fortuitous gap. 
  Galium Mollugo occurs
near the base of the handle.
  There are four small bee-
ches in the Back Lane. 
  A young oak c. 4 ft high
was found in the eastern field.
[9844-9845]

Large coppice has
made much better
growth than in 
Hayley. Even
where one or two
poles are left on

  One of the diseased
horse-chestnuts (in the 2nd
group southwards in the ave-
nue) was felled. It was
cut into lengths at various
distances from the ground. 
Some of these were cut 
lengthwise. Dr Rishbeth has 
most of the records.
  The disease appears
in a typical section as
a water-soaked discoloured
area of irregular shape
with loves. It shows
secondary zonation of dif-
ferent intensities of colour. [SYMB]
[DIAG]
[9862-9863]
Boundary:
[DIAG]
The water soaked area
has a pronounced and 
complex boundary with
ill-defined soaking in 
the wood outside it. 
Sometimes a black
zone - plate-like line
occurs in the place of 
the purple zone.
  The affected core 
extended up the tree
from the base, being
as it largest about
3ft up, and thereafter
tapering off. It was
connected directly to
about 12 snags, some
open, others healed after
some years of decay.
[DIAG]
The trunk forked about
[!!!!] 17ft up and a diseased
core abouth 1/2" dia. extended
into each branch. The
[9864-9865]
highest point of the dis-
ease was a small 
snag some 20ft high. 
  The core never quite
reached the surface, The 
"tongue" shown in the 
section reached 1/2" from 
the surface and was 
revealed in T.L.S as a
flange running somewhat 
helically rather than verti-
cally. Higher in the tree,
there were several shakes 
with cavities up to 1/8 in.
wide. One of these reached
the surface as a fine
crack about 18in. long.
The discolouration did not
quite reach the surface 
along the crack, which 
was evidently of some stan-
ding as attempts had 
been made to close it for
at least 8 years. Presumably
they failed because the
crack opened and closed
with the season. A similar
crack on the other side. 
not however reaching the
surface, resulted in the 
trunk being virtually split
down the middle. 
  The discoloured wood
[9866-9867]
runs with water and has
a faint lactic smell. 
  The annual increment
has not notably declined.
Lime. Felled at the 
same time. W. side of the
garden. About 40 ft high 
and c. 2ft diam. at the
base. Failed to come into
leaf this year. 
  Saved off at ground
level, a rather patchy
mid brown discolouration
over the whole collar, espe-
cially marked by one main
root where there was a 
marked Polyporus squarrosus
-type rot with traces of 
zone plates.
  The discolouration did
not extend more than 3ft
above the ground, mainly
on the side above the 
rotted root. Rest of wood 
healthy. No water soaking. 
  Evidently a root infec-
tion which got into the 
collar last winter and 
ringed the tree.
