"fragmentary" if not enough of 
the circumferemce is left to give

stool was certainly higher at one time.

  Wrest Park, Silsoe
  (conference)
  Mistletoe is very abun-
dant on the limes all over the 
Wrest Park estate - usually
not  more than 6 bushes 
per tree.
  Most of the limes, oaks, 
horse-chestnuts, and other
park trees at Wrest Park
are stag-headed or in some 
cases severely died-back.
The site is in a shallow 
valley and drainage may be
a factor. 
Many of the limes at
Wrest Park have large
knobs and bosses on the 
branches,usually at a 
crook in a branch.

Trials of the new motor-mower. 
  The mower was tried in 
the cross-roads glade and
taken up and down the
main glade. It cuts anything
up to 1/2 in. diam. and 
can be made to cut within
about 1 1/2 in. of the ground
if this is level. It gets 
easily through tall vegetation
and drags its way through
Rubus Caesius. 
  The whole of the cross-
[9834-9835]
- roads glade was cut ex-
cept the back portion of the 
S. quadrant. About 6ft
width of the main glade 
was cut. 
  A long-leafed form of Salix
atrocinerea occurs in the N.
quadrant of the cross-roads. 
Rusty hairs conspicuous.
November 4 (from p. 9807)
  The Leckhampton copper
beech produced a good crop
of nuts, many of which con-
tained embryos. A vast number 
were eaten by a squirrel which
sat in the tree and went 
through one cupule after an-
other, tearing them to bits. 
November 6 (from p. 9825).

tinued mild and rather damp.

Free-school Lane Gate is very

Yucca flowering in Downing 
College, it has massive panicle
some 4ft above the rosette of
pendulous deep cream flowers.
November 18. (from p. 9832)
  Ivy soon grows over the new
corrugated fibre-glass roof of
the Leckhampton Summer-
house, even though it finds 
little footing for the aerial roots. 
November 19 (from p. 9832)
  The Leckhampton Wisteria has
made very little growth this year. 
November 20 (from p. 9832)
  The Akebia at the Botany 
School produced a  few ripe fruits
this year.
November 21. (from p. 9832)
  The transplanted Portugal laurel
at the Botany School has suffered
little obvious damage because
of continued watering with a 
hose. 
November 23.
  Akebia is now shedding 
its leaves.
November 24.
  Operations in the Hayley Wood 
have been postponed and the
Wood closed beacuse of the 
foot-&-mouth epidemic. 
November 25. 
  The Ouse Washes (crossed in 
the train) are abouth 1/6 flooded.
Several swans on the water. 
  A cold and wet day with
[9838-9839]
sleet.
November 26.
  Many of the horsechestnuts
in the Avenue have quite large 
plates of bark hanging loose,
sometimes exposing wood underneath
November 27.
  Arbutus in Leckhampton
has much nearly-ripe fruit and
nearly-mature flower-buds.

in the dead vine on the
Leckhampton balcony, have

  Weather brighter with more
frost.
December 2.
  A geranium plant, grown 
on from a discarded bedding
plant in the Evanses' Palm
Court at Coton, has produced
new internodes and is now
about 3ft high and about
to flower.
December 3.
The Clematis, Passiflora, 
and Eccremocanpos are now
standing outside my back
door at Fanshawe House.
December 4.
  The transplanted Portugal 
Laurel shows signs of 
[9840-9841]
drying-out in some of its leaves.
December 5.
  A few bulbs are just showing 
through the earth.
December 6. 
  Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus
is now very luxuriant in the
long grass at Leckhampton. 
December 7.
  Bowiea volubilis (in the
temperate house at Bot. Gard.)
is a curious plant with a 
tuberous base from which
arise at certain seasons the
immensely branched and some-
what tangle inflorescence
branches, most of which are
green and sterile and form
the entire photosynethetic system
of the plant, whose leaves are
rudimentary. It is possibly
related to Dr Bainbridge's
blue Scilla-like plant with a 
very complex branched inflores-
cence, but this had normal
radical leaves as well. 
December 8. 
  A very severe frost has
frozen the Leckhampton pool.
  The Passiflorae, Eccremocanpos,
and the Clematis have been moved
indoors for the while. 
December 9.
  The frost continues and 
Queen's Ditch is frozen over.
