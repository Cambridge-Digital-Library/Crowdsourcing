  Great Ouse thinly frozen over at

  Deep brickpit at Whittlesey is quite

Henry Venables sawmills.
Cutting frozen logs is at most half as
fast as thawed & is hard on the saws.
[24922-24923]
4922
Elms. Roger Venables names
Red Elm - U. procera- the
common elm  (chair seat so
called - identity definite).
Wych Elm - identified by greenish
streaks in heartwood or wetwood
- a log so called appears to bed
Wheatley.
Dutch Elm - "mild", rather fast-
grown & sinuous - may well include
hollandica & ? minor.
  We both doubt whether these
names correspond exactly to elm
species. "Wych" elm is the common
sort of Staffs, Shrop, & the Welsh
border, "Dutch" is generally scattered
including some procera territory
and probably E. Anglia.
  Elm from Denmark is intermed-
iate between "wych" & "Dutch".
4923
     Timbers handled.
English Oak. Appears to be nearly
half the total volume in stock.
The best veneer logs are all fast-
grown, without epicormics.
  Venables cannot differentiate 
the species.
  Occasional cup & star shake.
American Oak. Smallish quantities
of both wnite & red. White is
rather lacking in grain compared
to English.
Japanese Oak. Looks very like
English. Straignt grained, rather
slow-growing, very dense.
  No evergreen oak.
Ash. About 1/6 of total. Much used
for minor structural purposes.
Beech. About 1/6 of tota;. Some
poor-quality logs are used.
[24924-24925]
4924
Elm. now not mjuch. Some dead
for many years so still usable.
Sycamore
Sugar-maple occ. - has a stronger 
grain than sycamore.
Cherry occ. - both Prunus avium
& American.
American Walnut.
Lim e occ.
Pine from Scotland - very fast grown.
Tropicsl - not very much, bit inclu-
ding mahgany.
Teak is curiously discoloured &
patchy after sawing; becomes more
uniform later.

Brown Oak (evidently infected
with fistulin) is very valuable.

Sawmill. A wonderful machine
4925
that picks up the log, orients it
with steel fingers to get the best
direction and orientation of cut,
and passes it through a band-
saw. The planks come off one by
one ans=d are conveyed by rollers
to a man who makes them up
into a 'set' for kilning.

Kilns. Drying planks tskes c. 10
days. Thermohygrographs record
wet & dry bulb temperatures in
kiln. Moisture content of timbdr
can only be ascertained by oven-
drying samples.

Oven-drying to constant weight
at 100oF - higher temperatures
cause decomposition.
[24926-24927]
4926
Furnace for kiln still burns oil
- plans to convert to wood burn-
ing, with automatic stoker.

Joinery. Produces window-frames,
kingpost roof-trusses, &c. - is
capable of doing medieval-type
carpentry. A speciality are acoustic
panels of beech etc., cut with
elbortae grooves designed by
Aston University for absorbing sound.

saws. The sawmill makes its own
saws from steel strip - punches out
& grinds the teeth and butt-welds
the joins. Saws last about 3 hours
before sharpening - much less with
frozen timber. Changing the saw
takes about 5 min.
Weather see p. 4940.

groves of oak & birch. Enclosure-Act
\hawthorn hedges, big strsight-edhed

not noticeable.

East Flintshire Hilly land of mixed
hedges. Some conifer plantations, almost
no native woodland.
4933
Around Halkyn & Holywell are scat-
tered farmsteads and mixed hedges.
Rather featureless slope, its top invisible.

Clwydian Hills The Llwybr-hir
plateau is rather featureless farmland

pass lies between steep moorland slopes.
Little to be seen of St Asaph.

Limestone Mountains. Abergele to the
Conway Estuary. Steep N-facing cliffs

sycamore, prob. secondary - often on old
quarries. Some of them coppiced c.
1950. Not much evidence of elm.
  The new road is nearly finished

Conway. The main road still goes through
[24934-24935]
4934

Mountain slopes covered with
heather above bracken at base.
In places there are scattered haw-
thorns and sycamores (post-myxo-
matosis?) chiefly smong bracken.

4935
Dept of Forestry, Bangor: discus-
sing research on broadleaved trees

Bethesda. Rather crowded little town
with 3- and 4-storet bui9ldings. The
quarries are probably disused, but
the town is only slightly run-down in 
appearance.

Nant Ffrncon. Valley uninhabited;
its flat bottom with occasional trees
of birch and alder. The great moun-
tains (Foel-Goch, Carnedd Dafydd)
are very rugged and Alpine in appear-
ance at this time of year. Some inva-
sion by hawthorn on their brackeny
lower slopes.
  Very extensive screes down to 700
ft alt.; many of them are not below

4336

tain sois as eroded.

Llyn Ogwen. Not quite all frozen
(at 100o0ft). Tryfan is hardly visibe.

Glyn Llugwys. Several small farmsteads
are still inhabited and apparently
functional. Some prominent cliffs on
the mountains to the N. The small
]????dolerite]  mountains N.E. of Capel Curig
are specially rugged.

Woods between Capel Curig & Betws-
-y-Coed. Much coniferized, but
substantial remains of native oak-
woods. The latter are of the Coed
Cymeran type, with bo]iggish, usuaslly
4937
w]
even-aged, maiden oaks and little
else. Not much holly. Some old
birchwoods and mixed oak & birch.

Betws-y-Coed.  Wonderful iron bridge
with a great arch, built in the year 
the battle of Waterloo was fought.

Glyn Conwy between Betws-y-Coed and
Pentrefoelas. The gorge of the river is
narrowly lined with oakwoods, most of
them not coppiced. Trees rather more
crooked than towards Capel Curig.
Some ash and occasional elm,
no lime seen. Not much hazel in this
area (though common in hedgers).

Pentrefoelas to Cerrig-y-Drudion. Mainly
farmland, with scattered farms and
