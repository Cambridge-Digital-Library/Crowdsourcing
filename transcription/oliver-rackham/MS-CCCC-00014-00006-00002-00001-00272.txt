regular ditches presumably of
periglacial origin. Vast extent 
of suburban sprawl, with patches
of bush at backs of rows of bungalows.

   A limousine - a kind of motor-
car for driver + 11 passengers _
luggage. It does the 70-odd miles 
from Kennedy Airport to New
Haven for $18.

  The whole coastal strip from
New York to New Haven is built up
uninterruptedly. Mostly consists of
plotland or houses in large gar-
dens with big trees.
Commonest tree is sp. of pine
looking rather like halepensis in
its thin diffuse crown, Needles
characteristically yellow and
stunted. This may have formed
the bulk of this strip before the
plotland developed.
Bluffs of metamorphic rock
with thin soil appear to bear
1037
mainly oaks - unevenaged,
thinly scattered, probably peri-
odiocally burnt.
  Fine swamp woods in a few
creeks & inlets near New Rochelle
- mainly pines, going right down to
high-water. Some of them standing
dead.

Driver of the limousine per-
emptorily ordered a passenger to
"out your cigarette, Sir!"

Woodworking. D. Houstin's house is
a modern frame house, with
timbers concealed. Some second-
hand timbers from barns, of
hemlock, white pine, hickory.
All three are worked by a com-
mon and characteristic method.

They are squared by chopping
at 45o to the line of the log every
foot or so with a broad-axe,
and removing the wood between

The "saltbox" house is like
a standard 17th-cent. symmetrical
house with an outshut at the 
back. The outshut appears
to be original; its roofline con-
tinues the main slope of the
roof.  D Houston says he has
seen an example near Guild
ford.
Guilford is a small town
round a square green or "com-
mon".  Fine Wren-type church,
timber-framed, at one side, with 
portico and elaborate steeple.
Many "saltbox" houses: others
are scaled-down versions of the

Canja spp.       ) folia and Acer
Sassafras        ) saccharum
Betula nigra     )
[TABLE]

Quercus alba. Probably the com-
monest tree, now up to c. 1 1/2 ft dia.
No young ones. Very like Q. robur
in bark. Straight upright habit
with strong apical dominance.
[21042-21043]
1042
Leaves shaped like robur, but
bigger, tapering at base, no
auricles.

Juniperus virginiana. Small gre-
garious tree, habit like an upright
J. communis but more spreading.
Very sensitive to shade, its dead
remains said to stand for many
years.

Rhus toxicodendron. Common at 
roadsides and along old walls,
though not very shade-tolerant.
Grows up trees by aerial roots very
like those of Hedera. Also an upright
bush or small tree said to reach
6 ft high. Produces small sucker
shoots. Abundant in D. Houston's
garden; some big old ones climb
1043
white oaks.
Can be cut or grubbed up
with care. The toxic material is
an oil, like Japanese lacquer
(Rhus vermicifluum). If it gets on
the skin an oxidizing soap will
remove it before it takes effect.

Fraxinus americana. Big ash very
like F. excelsior. Frequent.

Canja. As yet small trees with
smooth bark. Frequent.

Sassafras. Thin-trunked tree
reaching canopy. Has rugged
nearly black bark. Inner bark
orange, strongly aromatic of resin.

Betula nigra. Big birch with smooth
[21044-21045]
1044
dark-grey bark; it looks at
first sight like an alder.
Inner bark smells strongly of
oil-of-wintergreen.

Carpinus carolinensis. Small tree
with crooked fluted trunk, gray
bark, looking very like a small
C. betulus. Catkins long, narrow,
with red stigmas, not like those of
betulus. Uncommon, roadside.

Linodendron. Frequent as an e-
mergent tree, towering above the
oaks. Early-leafing (oaks and most
other spp. are still quite dormant).

Acer saccharum. Mostly still sup-
pressed saplings. This is one of the
commonest planted roadside trees.
1045
Old trees divide into several
massive branches about 10 ft up
giving the illusion of being pol-
lards. Bark rugged, peeling into
vertical strips. Trunk fluted.

Pinus strobus. A single huge
mouldering stump in the wood is
said by D, Houston to be this tree;
probably freestanding in a field.

Woodcutting. This wood belongs 
to the U.S. Forest Service. The
smaller trees have just been cut
by firewood cutters under a 
lease. They cut all species from
c. 3"-6" dia. This is appar-
ently for the first time. The re-
maining trees form about 70%
canopy; they have tall narrow
[21046-21047]
1046
crowns with gaps between.

Cornus virginiana. Frequent,
never dense, shadebearing. As
big as very large C. sanguinea.
This and other dogwoods have 
conspicuous cupule-like bracts.
C. florida is the commonest and
largest sp.

General canopy about 80 ft high
with [????fulips] c. 100 ft. No evidence of
coppice stools. understorey trees
very sparse; shrubs almost non-
-existent. Ground vegetation
thin, but quite a lot of species,
including anemone and Trillium.

         Yale.
   Hilly terrain with grid of streets.
1047
Buildings mostly wooden (oldest
c. 1880) in spacious grounds. Com-
monest planted trees are sugar
maple, red oak, European beech.
   Fagus sylvatica does well
(both green and copper varieties).
Hedera helix. Grown as ground-
cover in sheltered place outside
Yale Forestry School. Just remains
alive but loses all its leaves to
frost.
Elms. Ulmus americana was once
the common street tree of New
Haven ("City of Elms" - cf. Dickens).
Few big ones left; deaths
prob. c. 90%. Some disease seen.
No evidence of injection - but
various protective measures have
been tried, which are said to
delay the epidemic for about one
[21048-21049]
1048
year per measure.
Many young elms of unknown
genotype recently planted. These
are fruiting heavily. Slight disease
noted.
          Coast.
   Visited near Tuxis Island
off Madison church-town. Great
inland sea with Long Island just
visible in distsnce.
Beach. Narrow at high-tide,
rather steep, sandy. The local ig-
neous rocks yield garnets which 
are concentrated by wave action
(because of their different density)
into flecks and strips of visibly
darker sand.
Dunes. Much trodden and covered 
with foreign grasses. Patches of Ju-
1049
niperus virginiana up to c. 10 ft
high.
Swamps. A Nature Trail has been
set out through the slacks and
hinterland (D. Houston). Swamps
with Phragmites, Typha, and many
shrub spp. Said to contain much
poison-ivy - keep hands in pockets.
Extensive plank walkways made 
by people in thigh boots.
Hinterland. Much recent wood-
land. Juniper stage largely re-
placed by white pine and red 
maple. Some white pines of mar-
-kedly spreading pioneer habit.
Remains of juniper long-persistent.

       Smith, Yale Forestry Sch.
Old-field Wood near Connecticut
Forest Marking. By Glasgo Pond in
                    Griswould.
Quercus rubra dom., small
trees to c. 1 q/4 ft dia.
Q.c alba occ., mostly bigger.
Occasional oaks are multistemmed,
prob. 1-cuts.
Pinus strobus ab. in small groups.
Juniperus virg. occ., dead.
[!!!!Selginella] Lycopodium ?obscurum loc. ab.
Convallaria canadensis loc. ab.
Acer sacch. occ. in understorey,
not getting away.
Occ collapsed remains of big
old white pines.

Not much of a shrub layer:
thin but nearly continuous cover
of a small Prunus sp?
Herbs also very sparse.
1051
   Thin soil over granite. Boul-
ders frequently come through
and are heavily lichenized
(Parmelia caperata etc.).
   Acid soil with thick litter of
oak leaves - said to be a fire
hazard for a short period at
this time of year.
   No dogwood.

Alders. Alnus rugosa, a bush 
some 10 ft high, is the conmonest.
Also the bigger A. serrulata. Both
along shores of "ponds".

Amelanchier arborea. Frequent 
along edges of lakes. Now in flower,
very beautiful. Shadbush. Common
throughout the secondary woods.
[21052-21053]
1052
Pachang State Forest.
Terminal moraine of coarse
infertile sands and gravels.
Settled very late. The place
Voluntown commemorates  the
paying-off of volunteers in the 
French & Indian Wars (c. 1757) and set-
tling them on land grants.
Voluntown became a textile
town. Later, in the 20th cent.,
there was a Federal program
of buying out farmers on poor
lands to reduce agricultural
surpluses.
   Much of the area tumbled 
down to oakwood - very
slow growing. In some places
Pinus strobus came in under
the oaks.
   Place we were shown is
1053
nearly pure white pine c. 65 y.
old (c. 1 1/2 ft thick). Some thinning
followed by establishment of seed-
lings underneath - they are evi-
dently rather shade-tolerant.
Convallaria dominant - probably
helped by thinning; it looks much
like Maianthemum in Europe.

Pinus resinosa - planted in
patches; badly attacked by Formes
with group killing.

Some P. rigida.
Oak mainly Q. alba.

Chemaecyperis thyoides suc-
ceeded by Acer rubrum.

  These are the commonest trees
in a highly mixed stand - apparently

Still River Firewood Co. enter-
prise in the Putnam area - did

-----------------------------------
15 ft high. No timber trees. No
particular coppicing herbs.
  This stand, of at least 10 acres,
is the only recent coppicing seen
in E. Connecticut.

Sterling. Scattered township. Said
to be the poorest place in the state.
Single farms with small frame
barns. Over half the land is
farmland, much of it arable.
Drystone walls with numerous
trees, in some places amounting
to continuous fencerows. A few
old-fields reverting to woodland
within the last few years.
[21056-21057]
1056
Yale Forest.
   About 8000 acres, assembled
from about 100 old farms. Bought
by an old member of Yale, George Myers, for
about 4$ an acre c. 1913.
Much of it was then old-field
principally white pine, some of
which was then old enough to have 
been cut over.
   Presented to Yale Yniversity
c. 1930.
   Much difficulty in early years
through lack of saleable timber -
aggravated by the 1938 hurricane
which was very destructive.
   Felling resumned on a large scale
in the 1960s. By then much of the
cut-over areas had grown up
sufficiently. Mostly low-grade tim-
ber for pallets. Instead of earlier
1057

About 8" long.
Serpent with beautiful 
pattern of large patches.

[!!!!pallets] boxes & railroad ties.
Area examined [!!!!SE of Bigelow
Pond in Union]
All trees are even-aged c. 75
years.
Red maple and black birch
start fast.
Black & red oaks start slowly
and overtake the maple & birch
(and white oaks). White pine is 
also an emergent.

Convallaria canadensis freq.
[21058-21059]
1058
Panax trifolius ab.
        grey birch 
Betula populifolia - present 
in early stages, now completely
gone.

Big tree of B. populifolia x
papyrifolia

Hornbeam - frequent, small -
stays in understorey.
Kalmia latifolia also under-
storey, loc. ab. (shrub layer)
White pine will grow under
oak but not under maple -
this is attributed to differences
in the time of leafing.
Populus grandidentata
rare.
Vitis labrusca - abundant big vines.
1059
Ash starts quickly and is
then overtaken.
Witch-hazel freq. under-
storey bush.

Area of recent selective felling.
Stumps up to 4 ft high. About 40%
canopy remains.
Convallaria ab.
Hamamellis much attacked by
deer. Also some damage to oak.
Hemlock most affected of all.

Viola pubescens. frequent near
roadside. dirty yellow violet.

  Many of the smaller trees in
this forest - Prunus pensylvannica
etc. - have been partly blown over
in the 1938 storm, and have sent
[21060-21061]
1060
up new shoots from          [DIAG]
the upper side of
the trunk to re-form
a crown.

  An oak blown down in the 
1938 storm is still only partly de-
cayed; it is weathered into ridges
in the same manner as the 1924
dead oaks of Hayley Wood. Dia.
about 9".

1840 Farmhouse, Yale Forest.
Situated on the top of a 
drumlin ridge. This like other
drumlins is less rocky than the 
other moraine debris and was
farmed for a time. the family
also had a mill, used for
1061
sawing and corn-grinding. This
has a drystone earth-filled
dam, broken down by the floods
of the 1938 storm. Another, much
larger, dam was added in Myers's
time and survives.

Frogs. Spring Peepers live in the
numerous ponds and marshy hollows
about here. Very noisy all night.
Some synchronization.
Farmhouse. Framed building of
cellar and 1 1/2 storeys. Massive central
stone-bult stack, the foundations
of which in the cellar taper down-
wards to a narrow base. 4
downstairs rooms of different sizes
(plus a 1-storey outshut).
Boarded inside & out; little of
frame visible. Lower floor, visible
[21062-21063]
1062
in cellar, has joists about 9" x 9"
chiefly of oak; some round and
some scappled with single axe cuts
[DIAG] pattern.
  Some other farmhouses survive
in this area buty none is still agri-
cultural. This one is used by
Yale Forestry School as a field sta-
tion. Two cabins for bedrooms
and a common-room have been
added.

Visit to Mores Reservoir nearby
at dusk to observe beaver. No
animals seen but abundant
evidence of trees felled snd
bark-stripped logs piling up
around the spillway of the
concrete dam to the lake.
1063
       Travels.
Yale-Conn. Turnpike - Norwich
-Griswood-Voluntown-Sterling
-Putnam-Ashford.
   Almost entirely woodland;
the only extensive agriculture is
around Sterling. Rolling country
of granite or gneiss without cliffs
- but some small outcrops and
many areas of loose boulders.
Very frequent lakes and swamps.
   Woods still almost bare of
leaves. Species difficult to iden-
tify (except red maple, which bears
very conspicuous red fruits). Oaks
probably dominant on ridges, else-
where much beech & sugar maple.
Red maple dominant on hollows
& on edges of swamps but not con-
fined thereto.
[21064-21065]
1064
   Remarkable absence of conifers
other than white pine & juniper.
   Some areas of "coppice-woods"
pointed out to me, but stools
seldom seen more than once-cut
and do not form a large part of
the trees. Red maple probably
the commonest.
   Lichen growth fairly abundant
on trunks & main branches - Par-
melia caperata, saxatilis, etc. (seem
almost identical to British spp).
   Several tree species have con-
spicuously pale grey smooth twigs and
boughs up to c. 2" dia. - this
gives a "wintry" appearance to the
landscape. No lichen growth. Species in-
clude red maple, gray birch, beech,
and others.
No villages seen. Many
scattered houses mostly framed,
boarded, and painted. Norwich 
has suburbs of such houses in
broad branching valleys leading
down to the river Thames. No detec-
table resemblance to the original
Norwich.
Conn. Forest Nursery. Mainly conifers.
Deals chiefly in trees to be sup-
plied cheaply to communities &
individuals for amenity planting.

Soils. The areas visited this day
are in thin glacial soils with
many boulders. Soils mainly mor-
like. Substantial litter esp. of oak
& pine needles, but F layer
less than usual for European
[21066-21067]
1066
mor. Smell mor-like.
  Lumbricus is said to be in-
troduced and to be limited to
sites that have been plowed.
  Apart from swampy hollows,
woods are very dry by English stan-
dards - considering that there can-
not have been any appreciable
transpiration.

Weather. Gray chilly day with
occasional rain - could be
England at this time.

Symplocus. Abundant in all
flushes & swamps. Said to smell of
skunks - but smell is slightly
acrid, like Capsicum, not unplea-
sant. Taste resembles smell.
1067
            MORSE'S FARM
            YALE FOREST
2 May.      ASHFORD-CONN
Bottom-land near the lodge.
Red & sugsar maples - young stand
- and a big dead elm.
Caltha by stream.
Big stand of a large Veratrum.

      BEAVERS
Beaver Lake.
  Tree attacked fully 18" thick.
  Lodge is a mound of earth &
leaf-litter and debarked branches
about 12 ft across in shallow
water. About 2/3 of its substance
is wood.
  Mainly maple attacked, some 
white oak. Some white pine.
Beaver activity is greatest
around Mores Lake, a reservoir
with artificial dam. They have
[21068-21069]
1068
attacked several dozen trees
all within c. 10 yards of the
water's edge. They       [DIAG]
begin by biting off
the bark in a 
zone about 3 ft
up from the ground.
They then proceed
to bite away the 
wood in many
hundreds of near-
-horizontal incisor-
-slashes, leaving a pile of
chips. A typical slash leaves a
straight facet about 1 1/2" long.
Small trees are attacked all
round but big ones usually
from one side. The tree
falls leaving (if < 4" dia.) a
very characteristic pointed
1069
[DIAG]    [DIAG] stump. A
                 bigger 
                 tree leaves
                 a jagged
usually onesided stump. No
attempt seems to be  made to
control the direction of fall.
Trees fall away from the water,
or lodge in other trees. (It is 
said that beavers sometimes
kill themselves.)
  Felling probably takes several
nights. Some trees are evidently
barked long before felling, and
some were partly felled and
then left, in each case ther
cut and abandoned surfaces
are fully discoloured.
  Little species preference is
[21070-21071]
1070
apparent.
  Once down the tree is
gnawed to remove patches of
bark. The top & branches are
bitten off and taken away for

many dead aspens, birches etc.
It has been flooded by
beaver activity: site of dam

Beaver are said to have
returned to N.E. Connecticut
after being extinct. Now they
are said to be too many.
They have fluctuating popula-
tions because they eat up
their food supply. This is con-
jetured to be the mechanism
whereby swamps are colonized
by Chamaecyparis thyoides - a 
light-demanding pioneer now
very rare in Yale Forest.

Hugh Raup's reminiscences.
Treefall mounds earlier than
1600 are barely perceptible on
the ground, but can be detected
on a contour map and in the
organic accumulation and
overturned horizon. A
hurricane of c. 1490 can thus
be added to those of c. 1630,
1815,and 1938.
  No particular evidence of
general fires. Fires in North
America are strongly correlated 
with conifer dominance.
  Indians burnt vegetation
not only to drive game & improve
pasture but to get dry fire-
wood (island in Gt Slave Lake).
Evenaged stands on Boreal
forest - dated by counting
the rings. Prof Raup travelled

do not put out camp fires.
  Short spell in spring &

   What's the smoke about? I
suppose it's a sick Indian. As
soon as the wind goes down we'll
send a boat over. We got a

Plague among
Indians.
Indian  people of Mass. reduced from c. 30,000
to 7,000 in 1617 x 19; this probably
came from explorers. The plague
destroyed great multitudes of the bare
[????barons] heathen to make way for "the
chosen people of God" - Cotton
Mather.

[DIAG]

By 1650 settlement extended
continuously 30 mi in from the
1123
coast and had begun to enter Mass
via the Conn River.

Early forestry. Much concerned with
pine 1900 x 40, for which there was
an excellent market.

Money. Not prevalent in 1800
Taxes were worked out.
Bounty of £100 on Indian scalps
offered by Mass. General Courtin 1724.
Worked off in land grants.

1938 Hurricane. Destroyed all pine
>40 y old in Petersham except in a 
few sheltered places. Broadleaves
> 60 y similarly damaged.
  Considerable damage to buildings
but most frame structures sur-
vived. Seems to have been equi-
[21124-21125]
1124
valent to an exceptional storm
in England. [The great damage
to trees is attributed to heavy
rain preceding the wind.]
  Timber was salvaged in a well-
organized rescue operation. It
was stored under water in Har-
vard Pond and other ponds for
up to 2 years. Much of it was 
used in World War II.

Birch-bark Canoe. An example on
display. Light frame of poles.
Skin is one piece of bark from a 
very large Betula papyrifera about
2 ft dia., a straight trunk free 
of stubs and large lenticels. It
is shaped to the frame by cutting
out gores of bark. The seams are
sewn in some way and caulked
1125
with large masses of some tarlike
substance.

Models. Marvellous series of models
showing the rise and decline of
farmland in the area. The models,
chiefly made of copper wire, depict
individual trees = many thousands -
in astonishing detail.

        Petersham.
Small nucleated town. Centred
on a large triangular green with
houses straggling along about 7
roads. Very typical of inland
New England towns.
  Pronounced Peters-ham.
  Houses all framed and weather-
boarded. They appear to be 
mostly 19th cent., of 2 storeys, very
[21126-21127]
1126
variable in plan for the same
size, rather ornate. Widely spaced
and surrounded by short grass.
Most have extensive verandahs.
  Some houses bear 18th-cent
dates; these are usually simpler,
withut ornament or verandahs.
Those of this date of two storeys
often have vestigial "mini-jetties".
  Green has many large trees,
especially sugar-maple, ash, red
oak, locust. There is said to have
been much planting of shade trees
in the region in the mid-19th
cent.
  Two fine frame churches.
  A few houses have pillared
porticoes like those of churches;
this does not always denote
a specially grand house.
1127
For an area wbich has a
long history of decline this and
neighbouring towns aere unexpec-
tedly well kept up.

Insects. All houses in this area
(indeed all rural houses seen
in America) have mosquito-nets
of fine metal mesh at the win-
dows.
  Gypsy-moth egg-masses are
frequent but not in the
great masses prevalent near the
forest.

Harvard Forest. Consists in general
of semi-natural secondary
woodland. Plantations are fre-
quent but do not predominate.

Turners Falls has a monument
to a battle in which a local
