Succeeded by tract of low wood-
land, persisting mainly along
coast. Inland is mainly farm-
land - large hedgeless grid
fields. Soil much marked by ir-
regular ditches presumably of
periglacial origin. Vast extent 
of suburban sprawl, with patches
of bush at backs of rows of bungalows.

   A limousine - a kind of mnotor-
car for driver + 11 passengers _
luiggage. It does the 70-odd miles 
from Kennedy Airport to New
Haven for $18.

  The whole coastal strip from
New York to New Haven is built up
uninterruptedly. Mostly consists of
plotland or houses in large gar-
dens with big trees.
Commonest tree is sp. of pine
looking rather like halepensis in
its thin diffuse crown, Needles
characterristicaslly yellow and
stunted. This may have formed
the bulk of this strip before the
plotland developed.
Bluffs of metamorphic rock
with thin soil appear to bear
1037
mainly oaks - unevenaged,
thinly scattered, probably peri-
odiocally burnt.
  Fine swamp woods in a few
creeks & inlets near New Rochelle
- mainly pines, going right down to
high-water. Some of them standing
dead.

Driver of the limousine per-
w=emptorily ordered a passenger to
"out youre cigsrette, Sir!"

Woodworking. D. Houstin's house is
a modern frame house, with
timbers concealed. Some second-
hand timbers from barns, of
hemlock, white pine, hickory.
All three are worked by a com-
mon and characteristic method.

They are squared by chopping
at 45o to the line of the log every
foot or so with s broad-axe,
and removing the wood between
the chops with an adze.

Storm. Brilliant thunderstorm

dazzling lightning, torrential
rain.

1774 house with rudimentary

1645 saltbox back, added outshut.
The "saltbox" house is like
a standard 17th-cent. symmetrical
house with an outshut at the 
back. The outshut appears
to be original; its roofline con-
tinues the main slope of the
roof.  D Houston says he has
seen an esample near Guild
ford.
Guilford is a small town
round a square lgreen or "com-
mon".  Fine Wren-rype churh,
timber-framed, at one side, with 
portico and elaborate steeple.
Many "saltbox" houses: others
are scaled-down versions of the
1041
same type.

Fraxinus amer    ) by Fagus grandi-
Canja spp.       ) folia and Acer
Sassafras        ) saccharum
Betula nigra     )
[TABLE]

Quercus alba. Probably the com-
monest tree, now up to c. 1 1/2 ft dia.
No young ones. Very like Q. robur
in bark. Straight upright habit
with strong apical dominance.
[21042-21043]
1042
Leaves shaped like robur, but
bigger, tapering at base, no
[????acricles].

Juniperus virginiana. Small gre-
garious tree, habit like an upright
J. communis but more spreading.
Very sensitive to shade, its dead
remains said to stand for many
years.

Rhus toxicodendron. Common at 
roadsides and along old walls,
though not very shade tolerant.
Grows up trees by aerial roots very
like those of Hedera. Also an upright
bush or small tree said to reach
6 ft high. Produces small sucker
shoots. Abundant in D. Houston's
garden; some big old ones climb
1043
white oaks.
Can be cut or grubbed up
with care. The toxic material is
an oil, like Japanese lacquer
(Rhus vermicifluum). If it gets on
the skin an oxidizing soap will
remove it before it takes effect.

Fraxinus americana. Big ash very
like F. excelsior. Frequent.

Canja. As yet small trees with
smooth bark. Frequent.

Sassafras. Thin-trunked tree
reaching canopy. Has rugged
nearly black bark. Inner bark
orange, strongly aromatic of resin.

Betula nigra. Big birch with smooth
[21044-21045]
1044
dark-grey bark; it looks at
first sight like an alder.
Inner bark smells strongly of
oil-of-wintergreen.

Carpinus carolinensis. Small tree
with crooked fluted trunk, gray
bark, looking very like a small
C. betulus. Catkins long, narrow,
with red stigmas, not like those of
betulus. Uncommon, roadside.

Linodendron. Frequent as an e-
mergent tree, towering above the
oaks. Early-leafing (oaks and most
other spp. are still quite dormant).

Acer saccharum. Mostly still sup-
pressed saplings. This is one of the
commonest planted roadside trees.
1045
Old trees divide into several
massive branches about 10 ft up
giving the illusion of being pol-
lards. Bark rugged, peeling into
vertical strips. Trunk fluted.

Pinus strobus. A single huge
mouldering stump in the wood is
said by D, Houston to be this tree;
probably freestanding in a field.

Woodcutting. This wood belongs 
to the U.S. Forest Service. The
smaller trees have just been cut
by firewood cuttere under a 
lease. They cut all species from
c. 3"-6" dia. This is appar-
ently for the first time. The re-
maining trees form about 70%
canopy; they have tall narrow
[21046-21047]
1046
crowns with gaps between.

Cornus virginiana. Frequent,
never dense, shadebearing. As
big as very large C. sanguinea.
This and other dogwoods have 
conspicuous cupule-like bracts.
C. florida is the commonest and
largest sp.

General canopy about 80 ft high
with [????fulips] c. 100 ft. No evidence of
coppice stools. understorey trees
very sparse; shrubs almost non-
-existent. Ground vegetation
thin, but quite a lot of species,
including anemone and Trillium.

         Yale.
   Hilly terrain with grid of streets.
1047
Buildings mostly wooden (oldest
c. 1880) in spacious grounds. Com-
monest planted trees are sugar
maple, red oak, European beech.
   Fagus sylvatica does well
(both green and copper varieties).
Hedera helix. Grown as ground-
cover in sheltered place outside
Yale Forestry School. Just remains
alive but loses all its leaves to
frost.
Elms. Ulmus americana was once
the common street tree of New.
Haven ("City of Elms" - cf. Dickens)
Few big ones left; deaths
prob. c. 90%. Some disease seen.
No evidence of injection - but
various protective measures have
been tried, which are said to
delay the epidemic for about one
[21048-21049]
1048
year per measure.
Many young elms of unknown
genotype recently planted. These
are fruiting heavily. Slight disease
noted.
          Coast.
   Visited near Tuxis Island
off Madison church-town. Great
inland sea with Long Island just
visible in distsnce.
Beach. Narrow at high-tide,
rather steep, sandy. The local ig-
neous rocks yield garnets which 
are concentrated by wave action
(because of their different density)
into flecks and strpos of visibly
darker sand.
Dunes. Much trodden and covered 
with foreign grasses. Patches of Ju-
1049
niperus virginiana up to c. 10 ft
high.
Swamps. A Nature Trail has been
set out through the slacks and
hinterland (D. Houston). Swamps
with Phragmites, Typha, and many
shrub spp. Said to contsain much
poison-ivy - keep hands in pockets.
Extensive plank walkways made 
by people in thigh boots.
Hinterland. Much recent wood-
land. Juniper stage largely re-
placed by white pine and red 
maple. Some white pines of mar
-kedly spreadung pioneer habit.
Remains of juniper long-persistent.

Forest Marking. By Glasgo Pond in
                    Griswould.
Quercus rubra dom., small
trees to c. 1 q/4 ft dia.
Q.c alba occ., mostly bigger.
Occasional oaks are multistemmed,
prob. 1-cuts.
Pinus strobus ab. in small groups.
Juniperus virg. occ., dead.
[!!!!Selginella] Lycopodium ?obscurum loc. ab.
Convallaria canadensis loc. ab.
Acer sacch. occ. in understorey,
not getting away.
Occ collapsed remains of big
old white pines.

Not much of a shrub layer:
thin but nearly continuous cover
of a small Prunus sp?
Herbs also very sparse.
1051
   Thin soil over granite. Boul-
ders frequently come through
and are heavily lichenized
(Parmelia caperata etc.).
   Acid soil with thick litter of
oak leaves - said to be a fire
hazard for a short period at
this time of year.
   No dogwood.

Alders. Alnus rugosa, a bush 
some 10 ft high, is tge conmonest.
Also the bigger A. serrulata. Both
along shores odf "ponds".

Amelanchier arborea. Frequent 
along edges of lakes. Now in flower,
very beautiful. Shadbush. Common
throughout the secondary woods.
[21052-21053]
1052
Pachang State Forest.
Terminal moraine of coarse
infertile sands and gravels.
Settled very late. The place
Voluntown commemorates  the
paying-off of volunteers in the 
French & Indian Wars (c. 1757) and set-
tling them on land grants.
Voluntown became a textile
town. Later, in the 20th cent.,
there was a Federal program
of buying out farmers on poor
lands to reduce agricultural
surpluses.
   Much of the area tumbled 
down to oakwood - very
slow growing. In some places
Pinus strobus came in under
the oaks.
   Place we were shown is
1053
nearly pure white pine c. 65 y.
old (c. 1 1/2 ft thick). Some thinning
followed by establishment of seed-
lings underneath - they are evi-
dently rather shade-tolerant.
Convsallaria dominant - probably
helped by thinning; it looks much
like Maianthemum in Europe.

Pinus resinosa - planted in
patches; badly attacked by Formes
with group killing.

Some P. rigida.
Oak mainly Q. alba.

Chemaecyperis thyoides suc-
ceeds by Acer rubrum.

  These are the commonest trees
in a highly mixed stand - apparently
old-field, for a tumbled wall runs
through it. Rather dry rotting hilltop
with granite or gneiss boulders.
Stools to c. 2 ft dia.

Still River Firewood Co. enter-
prise in the Putnam area - did
not prosper.
-----------------------------------
15 ft high. No timber trees. No
particular coppicing herbs.
  This stand, of at least 10 acres,
is the only recent coppicing seen
in E. Connecticut.

Sterling. Scattered township. Said
to be the poorest place in the state.
Single farms with small frame
barns. Over half the land is
farmland, much of it arable.
Drystone walls with numerous
trees, in some places amounting
to continuous fencerows. A few
old-fields reverting to woodland
within the last few years.
