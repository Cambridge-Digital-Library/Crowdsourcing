Skellig Michael
Newfoundland. Approx. 3.30
Coast is glaciated   [DIAG] Fogo
Twillingate [DIAG] with numerous
                   islands and deep
                   parallel bays.
                   Islands look like
heathland in the sun. No snow
visible, but a floating iceberg, &
another iceberg stranded in a bay.
  There follows a wooded shieldland
with innumerable lakes & inlets of
sea. Pockets of snow in N-facing
hollows. No cultivation visible. Oc-
casionao roads.
Numerous straggly settle-
[21034-21035]
ments along coasts.
Most lakes still frozen
Interior is full of small ridges
lined with strips of remainin
snow. This gives way to areas
where snow patches preponderate,
evidently high ground. Roads
snow-covered. Hinds Hill
   Extensive peat-bogs in
hollows. Snow lies thickest at
margins between forest & peat.
Quite large lake

Inland gulf full of sandy [????hooks]
& [????cays] - bays at E. end of Long Island.
Succeeded by tract of low wood-
land, persisting mainly along
coast. Inland is mainly farm-
land - large hedgeless grid
fields. Soil much marked by ir-
regular ditches presumably of
periglacial origin. Vast extent 
of suburban sprawl, with patches
of bush at backs of rows of bungalows.

   A limousine - a kind of mnotor-
car for driver + 11 passengers _
luiggage. It does the 70-odd miles 
from Kennedy Airport to New
Haven for $18.

  The whole coastal strip from
New York to New Haven is built up
uninterruptedly. Mostly consists of
plotland or houses in large gar-
dens with big trees.
Commonest tree is sp. of pine
looking rather like halepensis in
its thin diffuse crown, Needles
characterristicaslly yellow and
stunted. This may have formed
the bulk of this strip before the
plotland developed.
Bluffs of metamorphic rock
with thin soil appear to bear
1037
mainly oaks - unevenaged,
thinly scattered, probably peri-
odiocally burnt.
  Fine swamp woods in a few
creeks & inlets near New Rochelle
- mainly pines, going right down to
high-water. Some of them standing
dead.

Driver of the limousine per-
w=emptorily ordered a passenger to
"out youre cigsrette, Sir!"

a modern frame house, with
timbers concealed. Some second-
hand timbers from barns, of
hemlock, white pine, hickory.

mon and characteristic method.

Houses in    [DIAG]

1774 house with rudimentary
jetties.

1645 saltbox back, added outshut.
The "saltbox" house is like
a standard 17th-cent. symmetrical
house with an outshut at the 
back. The outshut appears
to be original; its roofline con-
tinues the main slope of the
roof.  D Houston says he has
seen an esample near Guild
ford.
Guilford is a small town
round a square lgreen or "com-
mon".  Fine Wren-rype churh,
timber-framed, at one side, with 
portico and elaborate steeple.
Many "saltbox" houses: others
are scaled-down versions of the
