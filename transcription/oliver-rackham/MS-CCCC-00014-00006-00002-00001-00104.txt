Elsworth Wood cont.
[SYMBOL]
[DIAG]

[8166-8167]

Only one pond was seen,
the long one near the W.
corner of the wood, in a
deep hollow shaded by
hawthorns.

S.W. Elm Area (A).
A copse unfenced and
open to the cattle which
graze the surrounding fields.
Site fairly level, perhaps
an old habitation. There is
a slight bank to the N. and
the ground drops abruptly
at the edge of the wood on
the E. and S.
U. glabra dominant,
an almost pure stand, [SYMBOL] even-
-aged, probably once coppiced.
[!!!!] Some old maples. Few ashes &

8167
[No - fairly good Uc]
hawthorns. No shrubs or
coppice storey.
Carduus crispus & nettles
abundant. Mercury in low
density, pobably because of
trampling.
Few tall elms on the E.
side.

Very comparable with
the upper part of Overhall,
but rather drier, the elm
U. glabra, and formerly cop-
piced.

Felled Elm area (B).
This was apparently
a continuation of the pre-
ceding. Now entirely felled
(about 15 years ago, to judge

[8168-8169]
8168

from the state of the stumps)
apart from a few trees in
the N.E. corner, and con-
verted to pasture. There
seem to have been no trees
besides U. glabra.
No ground vegetation
remains, but for a very few
mercury plants. The slope
is fairly steep in most of
the area and it must have
been a mercury area.
A few big and very
decayed U. glabra remain on
the S.E. side. They were
probably not part of the wood
as such.

Mixed elm wood and scrub (C).
A very complex region.

8169

Ulmus glabra: dominant
except in the eastern third,
and in the S. corner which
has been felled and is
now scrub of maple, hazel,
&c. In the W. part, there
is an almost impenetrable
scrub of elm suckers, probably
not as a result of felling,
since no stumps were
seen. Suckers are otherwise
very sparse.
Ash: a few large trees in
the E. part.
Maple: abundant, and
locally dominant, in the E.
and S.
Hazel: abundant in the
E. and S., otherwise very
scattered.

[8170-8171]
8170 This Prunus suckers freely: slender
erect stems with long weak thorns
at right angles, twigs nearly glabrous.
Probably a P. domestica sp.
Prunus [!!!!] : forms
dense impenetrable thickets
in the E.  prob. spinosa
Oak: only one old felled top seen.
Hawthorn: marginal.
Salix fragilis: one on the
E, margin.
Elder: one near the
middle.

The ground vegetation 
is very patchy. Mercury
and nettles dominate. In
the intense shade of the
elm thicket there is a small
number of oxlips.
Odontites occurs on the
drift way round the N. side.

Old coppice with standards (D).

8171

A wood running along
the top of a ridge, sloping
down on both sides. Much
disturbed, specially at the
N.E. and S.W., but still
a good coppice with standards.
Not recently coppiced: becoming
rather light in places, like
the lighter parts of Hay-
ley.

Oak. Dominant. Few large
trees. Not many stumps.
Small quantities of felled
tops (like in Hayley). Two
stumps seen to coppice.
Ash. Comparatively scarce.

Hazel. Dominant understorey.


[8172-8173]
8172

Hawthorn. Crataegus monogyna.

Maple. Abundant.

Elder. In two places.

Crab. One at the N.E. side.

Plum. A series of trees
runs along the crest of the
ridge for over 100 yards.
About 20 trees survive;
some have fallen. They
appear to be the survivors
of a (possibly double) avenue.
They are typically plum
rather than blackthorn, and nearly
glabrous (unlike bullaces and
green-gages). They do not
sucker much. There is

8173

much blackthorn in this
part of the wood. The
avenue is overgrown, and
sizeable oaks and maples
grow in its path.

Apple. Six trees survive in
the N.E. part of the wood
(one fallen). They are
large orchard-type stan-
dards. They are now
in the shade of big oaks
and other trees, and pro-
duce no fruit. They are
planted in rows and are
evidently the survivors of
an orchard or garden.
The plum avenue is
aligned on the site, but does
not reaach it.

[8174-8175]
8174

Elm. Ulmus glabra forms
two small marginal patches.
Trees mainly small, few large.
No sign of extension.
No poplar.
Oxlip. Widespread in hollows
among mercury, but only
locally dominant. In the
N.W. is an area where
oxlip covers 50% of the
ground in a small sharply
defined area to the exclu-
sion of mercury. The site
is on a steep slope and
there is no obvious explana-
tion for this. It is in dense
shade of oak and hawthorn.

Filipendula. None, except in a
small area in the middle.

Bluebell. Marginal only.

Nettle. Abundant in limited
areas, but not very tall.

Geum. Covers 30% under
dense shade of hazel and
Prunus spinosa in the cen-
tral oxlip area.

Poa angustifolia. Local, but
abundant in the N.E. elm
area.

Anthriscus. Very abundant
marginally on the E. side.

Campanula trachelium. Many
plants near the wood margin
in a limited area on the E.

[8176-8177]
8176

side. Flowers quite well despite
the dense shade. NGS

Epipactis presumably helleborine.
One in the old orchard. OGS.

Euonymus. One seen in the
N.E. part of the wood.

Iris foetidissima. A large
patch near the S.W. side of the
wood.

This wood compares with
Hayley thus:
1. Smaller and drier. Oxlip
areas very small (about an
acre in all), and no species
wetter than oxlip. Hardly
any Filipendula: other ground

8177

flora of Zones 2 & 3 poorly
represented.
2. Tree cover rather similar,
but with less ash.
3. Well-represented marginal
species: this correlates with
the absence of C. oxyacan-
thoides. There is, however,
no terrestrial ivy.
4. Neither primrose nor bluebell
forms any intermediate
zones. This is the most
striking difference from Hard-
wick, which this wood other-
wise much resembles.
5. Much more disturbed.

survey are with the Hayley
Wood records]

Gamlingay Wood (with
Joan Wilson)
A short rapid parambula-
tion.
The wood is rather
flat but slopes down in
the N.W. half. Ground rather
dry with no sign of sur-
face water. The "loamy"
soil in the centre is very
marked.
No sign of recent coppicing.
About 2/3 of the wood
have been clear felled and
planted with spruce and
other conifers, partly as a
nurse crop to oak (some
perhaps growing from the
old stumps).
The fragments remaining

8181

of the old wood suggest a
somewhat wetter flora than
Hayley, with a very large
oxlip area extending nearly
up to the southern margin.
Tree and coppice structure
similar to Hayley, with ash
less prominent and poplar
very abundant in places.
Few stumps and little dead
wood. Marcury remarkably scarce.
No elm seen.
Section 1a. This recently
wooded area is still markedly
lower than the rest of the
wood, with few large trees.
There is a considerable though
broken area of brambly
scrub, with pockets of
bare ground.

Section 1b. Intact coppice with
standards.

Section 2. Coppice with standards,
somewhat thinned and
locally disturbed by widening
the central ride and by
the clearing and planting of
Section 6.
Mercury area very mar-
ginal.
Campanula trachelium
abundant, especially where
the wood has been opened.
A small Carex riparia
area.
Lythrum, Centaurium, and
Filago germanica occur on
the middle ride.
Adamson describes this area as
Filipendula society, with local Deschampsia.
8185

Section 3. Not seen.

Section 4. Coppice with standards.

Section 5-10. Conifers and
young oak, now mostly at
the thicket stage. Little sign
of the original ground
flora, except the bracken.
The central ride is
wide and much used by
traffic, though not in summer.
It is fringed by tall
vigorous bracken.
Adamson describes this
area as Pteridium aquilinum
Society in the middle. The
area occupied by bracken
has slightly increased to the
N.E. (by not more than 20

[8186-8187]
8186

yards)The S.W. boundary is
unchanged.
Vicia [!!!!] tetrasperma occurs
along the middle ride. Big
bush-like intricate masses
up to 2ft high. OGS.
Calamagrostis epigejos
has invaded large areas.
Clinopodium vulgare occurs
along this ride.

Section 11. Recently planted
conifers under thinned cop-
pice with standards. Little
trace of the original vege-
tation.

Section 12. Coppice with stan-
dards. Oaks sometimes few.
Poplar very abundant.

8187

Campanula trachelium is
abundant in the wood margin
on the S.E. side.
Odontites occurs on the
drift.

One under hazel in Gam-
lingay Wood, the intact E.
section near aspen but no birch
3[SYMBOL]-5[SYMBOL]-[SYMBOL] (middle).
P. low-campanulate, pale
smokey brown, smooth in mid[????]d[????]
strongly cracked into areoles
near the margin and exposing
the yellowish underneath,
firm, matt, slightly viscid in
middle.
S. tall, firm, slightly
waisted near top and dilated
near base, dirty whitish,
with numerous fawn squamules

[8188-8189]
8188

in upper third and brown
granules in the rest, solid.
P.S. pale yellowish
fawn, adnate. P. moderately
large (c. o.7 mm dia.), some-
what thin-walled and angular
T. long.
C. white, slight acrid smell,
turning pink in several min-
utes, with a slight local
bluish tinge.
Leccinum carpini (Boletus
[SYMBOL]scaber). Almost certain,
but colour change slow.

About 25 rabbits were
seen in broad daylight in
the course of a short after-
noon at Elsworth. One was
myxomatous.

July 20 (from p.8162).
N.E. Berks is an area of
acid sands, with extensive
chestnut coppice. There are

[8190-8191]
8190

heaths with big pine planta-
tions in the neighbourhood of
Easthampstead.
July 22.
Ipomoea still suffers from
dwarfing and chlorosis of
leaves, but is producing
abundant flower-buds
July 23.
Hemsby & Winterton.
With P.J.Grubb, as a prepara-
tion for the Part II class. For
pH measurements, see pp 8129-
-32.

Dunes at Hemsby.
Winterton Valley extends
S. up to the beach road
of Hemsby. The outer dunes
are a gray-dune system

8192

[DIAG]

forming a plateau, often
with a slight valley down
the middle. Sand is slowly
being added to the outer
edge of the plateau. The
vegetation is mainly Ammo-
phila. Corynephorus does
not occur.  Brambles, elder,
privet, and Hippophae are
very local.
The seaward side of
the main dunes is fairly
stable.  In front are obscure
hummocks, at times running
into a continuous grassy

[8192-8193]
8192

ridge, which are probably
the eroded remains of an
outer range rather than
embryo dunes: they have
recently accumulated much
fresh sand, but have
marram rhizomes deeply
buried in them.  Cakile is
particularly abundant.  When
they are slightly more
stable, they are dominated
by Ammophila with only
occasional Agropyron.
The landward side of
the Valley appears to be
fringed by very old dunes
against the cliff.  These are
mainly bracken (which does
not occur anywhere else at
Hemsby or Winterton). Sieglin-

8193

gia occurs sparingly at
the foot of the slope.
A fringing low, full at
half tide, occurs all along
this coast including Winterton.

Dunes at Winterton. [DIAG]
Carex arenaria has stomata
on the back of the leaf, but
none that are visible with a
X20 lens on the front.
Corynephorus is papillose
all over.
Jasione occurs sparingly
on the dunes just N. of the
cart gap.
A single plant of a curious
ericoid was found betwen
the cart gap and the warning
poles, near the seaward

[8194-8195]
8194

edge of the dunes. Procumbent, or ascending,
recalling Erica tetralix.  Leaves
mainly in whorls of four,
quite glabrous, bright grass
green, rolled up so that
the underside appears as
a white streak on the back.
In dunes just past the
Corynephorus stage.
Lichen communities
occur in considerable
areas on the oldest dunes.
They differ from those on
the breck in the larger
number of species and the
rather greater predominance of
squamulose and crustose forms.
They can cope with only the
minimum of sand accretion.

Dune Lichens, Winterton & Hemsby.
295. Cladonia squamosa ?
old dunes, Hemsby Long Valley.
K-Pd-
296. Rather like C. endiviaefolia,
but with dichotomizing squam-
ules and short irregular
proliferous scy. with pale
brown apo. [!!!!]Cl. cervicornis[!!!!].
K-C-Pd+r  C.foliacea
297. C. [!!!!]subsquamosa?[!!!!] cervicornis  Small,
foliose, squamules narrow, purp-
lish-tinged underneath, with
small simple pod. and narrow
scy. K [SYMBOL] y, Pd +r, C-.
298. Resembles C. [!!!!]crispata[!!!!] gracilis but
more branched, especially
near tip, branches usually
from margins of tiny open scy.
Prob. C. crispata, but shouldn't

[8196]
8196

be sorediose. K-P-. Scarce.
299. C. macilenta ? Degenerate,
large, sparingly branched,
with occasional closed scy.
Pd + or, K + y.  polydactyla
300. C. grayii. Like C. chloro-
phaea, proliferous from
centre. K -, KC -, Pd -.
301. C. floerkeana
302. Hypogymnia physodes.
The above (296-302) occur
very abundantly on parts
of the oldest dunes (heavily
leached at surface, see p. 8130).
They form a very distinct
community resembling those on
the breck. Other species:
C. impexa ([!!!!] also C. sylvatica; C.uncialis
C. gracilis                               rare)
Cornicularia
