[8166-8167]

Only one pond was seen,
the long one near the W.
corner of the wood, in a
deep hollow shaded by
hawthorns.

S.W. Elm Area (A).
A copse unfenced and
open to the cattle which
graze the surrounding fields.
Site fairly level, perhaps
an old habitation. There is
a slight bank to the N. and
the ground drops abruptly
at the edge of the wood on
the E. and S.
U. glabra dominant,
an almost pure stand, [SYMBOL] even-
-aged, probably once coppiced.
[!!!!] Some old maples. Few ashes &

[No - fairly good Uc]
hawthorns. No shrubs or
coppice storey.
Carduus crispus & nettles
abundant. Mercury in low
density, pobably because of
trampling.
Few tall elms on the E.
side.

Very comparable with
the upper part of Overhall,
but rather drier, the elm
U. glabra, and formerly cop-
piced.

Felled Elm area (B).
This was apparently
a continuation of the pre-
ceding. Now entirely felled
(about 15 years ago, to judge

[8168-8169]

from the state of the stumps)
apart from a few trees in
the N.E. corner, and con-
verted to pasture. There
seem to have been no trees
besides U. glabra.
