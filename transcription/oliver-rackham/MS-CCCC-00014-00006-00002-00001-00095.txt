March 2.
Madingley Wood.
Cirriphyllum craosinervium is 
locally abundant in open sites
between groups of spruces in the 
chalk-pit. 
The activities of badgers 
are very obvious. There appear
to be 8 holes in the w. slope
of the chalk-pit, near the top
of the talus, among young
ashes and bramble scrub. There
is much fresh excavation and 
several cubic yards of earth have 
been thrown out. Most of the
holes have definite "roadways". 
There is a well-defined track
leading [!!!!]N[!!!!] S.E. up into the 
"pan-handle". Here it branches, 
one branch heading in the

[7718-7719]
direction of the wood proper,
the other through a well-polished
gap in the chestnut fence into 
the field between the wood and 
the pit. Dung-pits are numerous. 
March 3
Silver-fish are frequent in 
my bathroom at Leckhampton and 
are often found in the bath.
March 4 
In Leckhampton, robins and 
sparrows cause much trouble
by flicking sand out of pots
mulched with it on the balcony,
but without directly attacking the
plants.
March 5. 
The crocuses are about at 
their best in King's
March 6
Hayley Wood - coppicing
Tetraphis was found on a 
hawthorn stump (just felled)
in the S. corner of this year's 
plot, just outside the [!!!!]coppiced[!!!!] prohibited 
area.
Lepidozia on stumps and 
logs in the prohibited areas 
(which are now islands of
standing trees surrounded by 
clear areas) shows considerable
signs of drying up. 
The water level is about
stationary since last visit. 
Oxlips are starting to flower. 
A very small proportion in the 
1964-5 plots and elsewhere have 
elongated scapes and open 
flowers. The majority have 
not yet elongated their scapes.
[7720-7721]
The poplars (male) in the 
1966 plots are flowering. 
A maple 14in. diam. was 
felled. Stool tree, log quite sound.
First ring 1903 [????].
Dog's mercury is flowering. 
Orchis mascula leaves are 
fully developed.
March 7. 
Elms are starting flowering.
March 8. 
Lathraea clandestina is 
appearing above the surface, but
not yet flowering. 
March 9.
Owls are often heard in
Leckhampton.
March 10. 
A Clematis and a Passiflora
from Sanders were planted. They 
were put into wooden boxes, 
about 1ft square, containing
aout 1/2 clayey loam, 1/4 peat, 
1/4 well-netted compost, with 1/2 in. 
of pure sand in the bottom. 
They were covered with crumpled
newspaper to protect from frost.
March 11. 
The Primulas in Leckhampton
have nearly fully-developed leaves.

March 15. 
Hayley Wood (Professor Valentine). 
Prof. Valntine dug up a 
few oxlips from various places. 
Galeobdolon occurs on an 
ash stool to the S.E. of the 1966
plot. 
A butt log 4 ft long of the 
big maple (p. 7720) with a ripple
grain was put aside under a 
thick hawthorn bush to season. 
The water level is much 
the same but the surface is 
drying out.
March 16. 
Gnats are becoming a 
nuisance at the far end of 
Leckhampton. 
March 17. 
The cornfield weed pots were 
moved to the Botanic Gardens. 
Germination as follows: 
Filago spathulata. 36 plants per

plants to the pot. Epidermal
cells easily seen with x20. Slight
cobwebby hairs about the leaves.
