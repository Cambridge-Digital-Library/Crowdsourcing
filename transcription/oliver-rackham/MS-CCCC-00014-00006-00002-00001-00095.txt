March 2.
Madingley Wood.
Cirriphyllum craosinervium is 
locally abundant in open sites
between groups of spruces in the 
chalk-pit. 
The activities of badgers 
are very obvious. There appear
to be 8 holes in the w. slope
of the chalk-pit, near the top
of the talus, among young
ashes and bramble scrub. There
is much fresh excavation and 
several cubic yards of earth have 
been thrown out. Most of the
holes have definite "roadways". 
There is a well-defined track
leading [!!!!]N[!!!!] S.E. up into the 
"pan-handle". Here it branches, 
one branch heading in the

[7718-7719]
direction of the wood proper,
the other through a well-polished
gap in the chestnut fence into 
the field between the wood and 
the pit. Dung-pits are numerous. 
March 3
Silver-fish are frequent in 
my bathroom at Leckhampton and 
are often found in the bath.
March 4 
In Leckhampton, robins and 
sparrows cause much trouble
by flicking sand out of pots
mulched with it on the balcony,
but without directly attacking the
plants.
March 5. 
The crocuses are about at 
their best in King's

Hayley Wood - coppicing
Tetraphis was found on a 
hawthorn stump (just felled)
in the S. corner of this year's 
plot, just outside the [!!!!]coppiced[!!!!] prohibited 
area.
Lepidozia on stumps and 
logs in the prohibited areas 
(which are now islands of
standing trees surrounded by 
clear areas) shows considerable
signs of drying up. 
The water level is about
stationary since last visit. 
Oxlips are starting to flower. 
A very small proportion in the 
1964-5 plots and elsewhere have 
elongated scapes and open 
flowers. The majority have 
not yet elongated their scapes.
[7720-7721]
The poplars (male) in the 
1966 plots are flowering. 
A maple 14in. diam. was 
felled. Stool tree, log quite sound.
First ring 1903 [????].
Dog's mercury is flowering. 
Orchis mascula leaves are 
fully developed.
March 7. 
Elms are starting flowering.
March 8. 
Lathraea clandestina is 
appearing above the surface, but
not yet flowering. 
March 9.
Owls are often heard in
Leckhampton.
March 10. 
A Clematis and a Passiflora
from Sanders were planted. They 
were put into wooden boxes, 
about 1ft square, containing
aout 1/2 clayey loam, 1/4 peat, 
1/4 well-netted compost, with 1/2 in. 
of pure sand in the bottom. 
They were covered with crumpled
newspaper to protect from frost.
March 11. 
The Primulas in Leckhampton
have nearly fully-developed leaves.
March 12. 
Erythronium dens-canis is 
flowering in Leckhampton. 
March 13
A bat was seen in the Old 
Court.
March 14
Gnats were [!!!!] seen in the evening in Leckhampton.
[7722-7723]
March 15. 
Hayley Wood (Professor Valentine). 
Prof. Valntine dug up a 
few oxlips from various places. 
Galeobdolon occurs on an 
ash stool to the S.E. of the 1966
plot. 
A butt log 4 ft long of the 
big maple (p. 7720) with a ripple
grain was put aside under a 
thick hawthorn bush to season. 
The water level is much 
the same but the surface is 
drying out.
March 16. 
Gnats are becoming a 
nuisance at the far end of 
Leckhampton. 
March 17. 
The cornfield weed pots were 
moved to the Botanic Gardens. 
Germination as follows: 
Filago spathulata. 36 plants per 
sq. in., 48 sq. in., thus c. 1700
plants to the pot. Epidermal
cells easily seen with x20. Slight
cobwebby hairs about the leaves. 
[DIAG]
Papaver argemone, 
54 out of 400
germinated. One 
tricotyledonary.

March 19. 
In the Bicester area, there
are many old trees of Phil-lyrea planted in cottage gar-
dens. This forms a medium-
-sized tree with a rounded 
crown and a stout bare 
crooked trunk. 
In Pusey Heath Wood,
by the main road N. of Pusey,
Berks, the ground is carpetted
with many millions of Im-
patiens parviflora seedlings,
which touch one another over 
many acres. They are now
at the stage of 1st leaves
about 1/4 in. long. They
are very sensitive to drought,
as when growing under a
log which deflects the rain. 
Oaks in this wood are
tall and with few branches
but with a curiously kinky
habit. 
Armillaria rhizomorphs
were found abundantly on
a large elm log here. 
A witches' broom of larch

[7728-7729]
was seen in this wood. 
Ulmus procera is
abundant in Berks, Wilts, 
and Somerset. 
The great sarsen mega-
liths at Avebury are 
mainly free of lichens or
bear only small ones, pre-
sumably because the 
original surface was removed
in the 18th cent. for use as 
building stone. Two of the
large ones, however, which
still have ragged tops, 
bear Ramalina and Leci-
dea spp, the latter over 
1 ft across. These stones 
appear to be used by birds. 
One of them in spattered with 
owl pellets.
Sarsen is a stone much
resembling granite and worked 
as such. The megaliths
contain large irregular cavi-
ties and the outer surface is 
very ragged. 
By the Burrows Dam, near
Athelney, Somerset, mistletoe
was found on a willow. 
Usnea was found in a 
gate near the same place. 
Berberis hedges line the
road near Hele, Cullompton, 
Devon. 
There are fine sessile 
oak-woods in the gorge
of the Teiga near Dunsford.

Most of the middle of 
Dartmoor is quite dry, hea-
ther and grass moor, with 
occasional flushes and 
only shallow dead peat. 
The Dart at Postbridge
is a very clear shallow 
stream in a shallow slightly 
wooded valley. The following 
were found: 
Lemanea no. 9
Marsupella aquatica 10
Scapania undulata 11
Fontinalis gracilis 12

is abundant on rocks
above the present (rather low)
water level. 14
By the mud-flats of 
the Merther branch of the
Fal at Tresillian are some 
interesting semi-salt marshes
with a low tangled wood
of ash and willows. Part
of this has recently been 
cut and is coppicing. 
Parts of the Goonhilly & Crousa
Downs were burning today. 
March 20 CHANNEL VIEW 
COVERACK - ST KEVERNE
Anthoceros laevis 
Abundant in a field at 
778177. Soil rather clayey, 
on serpentine, with a 1st-
-year rye-grass ley. Most 
obviously had much
standing water. The thalli


[7734-7735]
are rather thin, bright green, 
forming rosettes up to 2 in. 
diam. Male plants bear yel-
lowish antheridia, easily visible
to the naked eye, in shra[????]s.
Female plants have arche-
gonial warts from which 
the sporophytes (the oldest
now about 1/4 in. long) protrude. 
The plant occurs on fine 
water-deposited silt; it is 
the most abundant bryophyte
in this field. 
Physcomitrium pyriforme. 
A curious plant, recalling 
Funaria and Bryum in its 
habit, Philonotis in its habitat.

[DIAG] Spore & elator

the earthen floor of a mini-
ature cave below rocks, Black
Head. 
Erica vagans. Abundant 
along the road from Coverack
to St Keverne, S. of Crousa
Common. Grows up to 5ft 
high in the hedge-banks, 
where not burnt. Does not
occur in the fields and 

[7736-7737]
scrub around. 
A much dwarfer habit 
is found over several acres 
of moorland along the coast
between Chynhalls Point and 
Black Head. It forms
low rounded bushes about 
1ft high with a dense 
stand of Agrostis setacea
between. 
The old flowers are 
still seen on the bushes/ 

Anthemis nobilis occurs 
on damp trodden ground
around Chynhalls Farm. 
A very large white-fld 
form of Viola odorata was 
found in a bank between 
St Keverne and Coverack.
Scolopendrium is very
abundant in hedge banks
and walls, but Ceterach
absent. 
Ulmus cornubiensis is 
frequent around St Keverne, 
but probably always planted. 
Helxine is abundant in 
Coverack, and flowers abun-
dantly. 
Umbilicus is abundant in 
banks. The leaves get appreciably 
hot in hot early morning 
sunshine. 
Herniaria ciliolata is 
frequent on rocks around
Coverack and at Black
Head, in sunney situations. 
It forms a low intricate
shrub and looks surprisingly 

[7738-7739]
like Thymus serpyllum. 
35: Marchesinia Mackaii. 
Abundant on very shaded 
vertical rocks in hedges at
Coverack
Isoetes area on Black Head.
This is a short turf 
on shallow soils over
serpentine. The flora is 
richest in slight damp 
hollows.
Scilla verna and S. autum-
nalis (indistinguishable ex-
cept by occasional unopened 
infls or dry infls of last
year). Locally dominant. 
Isoetes hystrix. Very similar
to the above but leaves 
at least 10, shorter, more 
yellowish. 
Montia fontana. Locally 
abundant
Myosotis collina
Rubia peregrina
Frullania Tamarisci is 
abundat on the more 
exposed sides of boulders. 
F. germana is confined to 
the undersides of over-
hanging boulders and the
bases of rocks among grass. 
Riccia spp. grow here 
on bare ground among 
Scilla.
Gongylanthus ericetorum
should be abundant here,
but is withered already, the 
season being bery early. 
Inula crithmoides is abundant 
on serpentine in the spray zone, Black Head.


[7740-7741]
Heath between Chynhalls 
Point and Black Head 
Agrostis setacea forms 
dence mats resembling 
Festuca orina. It is co-
dominant with Erica vagans. 
Anthemis nobilis is very abundant in trodden 
places as a short turf.
Ramalinae are very 
abundant on serpentine 
rocks along the coast. 
Bird-rocks are distinguished
chiefly by Xanthoria.
