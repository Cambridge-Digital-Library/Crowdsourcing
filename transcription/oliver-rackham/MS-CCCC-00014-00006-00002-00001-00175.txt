Railway.
   From Mr Cox's level crossing
at least as far as Little
Hainl (at least 600 yards)
the cutting is filled over 6 ft
deep with old tyres. [SYMBOL] 32. 33.  There
is a similar deposit about 
100 yards long E. of the W. 
level crossing.  [SYMBOL] 30, 31.The great tyre
fire took place on more 
than an acre of land along-
side Mr Cox's drift [SYMBOL]31:  this land
is now covered with the wire
from the tyres.
   Other plants on the rail-
way:
Geranium robertianum and
Galium aparine.  Forming a
mixed community, nearly closed

in places on the ballast of
the N. track.  Much more
sparse on the S. track, apparently
because the ballast was
thinner.  Geranium is exceed-
ingly variable in leaf shape
and habit;  sometimes condensed
into a globular semi-witches'-
broom.
   Lamium album in verge
by E. crossing.
   Alopecurus myosuroides rare.
   Viola arvensis rare.
   Cardamine hirsuta frequent
on ballast.
   Luzula campestris dominant
in small areas in the S. range
alongside the old wood.
   Alliaria abundant near the
3175
W. crossing.
   Cirsium vulgare xerophorum:
a single plant between the
railway and Mr Cox's concrete
road W. of the crossing.
   Melampyrium cristatum:
emergent seedlings in several
places.
   Serratula: a single large 
plant from last year. [SYMBOL] 29
   Calamontha frequent in
ballast.
   Much of the northern ex-
-wood verge is covered with
Filipendula.  On the ex-field
verge. This is confined to the 
verge ditch.
   Valeriana officianalis fre-
quently colonizes the thinner

   Young birches are about
4 pendula to 1 pubescens.

   Galeobdolon is much in-
creased and spectacular in
the 1969 coppice.
Mowing.
   Whole of Great Glade.
   Whole of Roundabut ex-
cept the outer part of the S. 
quadrant.
  And Ride Glade from Round-
about roughly halfway to end.
   Pond Glade

Worm holes in sun-scalded

are receding; apparently
they are weakened or
even killed by mowing.
  Scrophularia nodosa[DIAG]
on railway:  very large plants.
  Galium verum frequent
in rhe ex-field part of the rail-
way (both verges).
  Acrocladium cuspidatum on
mud of 1st Ride.
  Bluebells are very impressive
especially on and around
Triangle Drift. Just past the
peak of flowering.  One white
one seen.
  Neottia not yet visible.
  Hayley Ditch Pond is almost
empty, evidently through leakage.
Vegetation and trees around
3179
apparently unaffected by flooding.
  Ptilidium and Nowellia have
flourished, but are now very
dry.
  No standing water in
M. Martin's black hole or in
any other surface hollow.
Deer's drinking hole almost
dry.  A few pools in Old 
Hayley Lane.
  Callitriche rare or absent
on rides and in ponds.
  A 2-year-old oak seen
on N.E. ride.  Many oak
saplings on both railway
verges.
  Heracleum angustifolium
occurs in Hayley Lane more
sparingly than the type.

  Salix repens:  at least one
plant survives at all the plan-
ting sites, except one of those
along 3rd N. Ride.  Growth gen-
erally poor, perhaps because
of competition and grazing.
  Genista:  survives at both
sites.
  The small oak in the
1969 coppice was bitten off 
about 2 in. high somw months
fgo, but has responded vigor-
ously.
  Dicranella heteromalla: frequent
on bare wood of fallen oaks.

  Polyporus squamosus.  2
large new sporophores on one
of the horsechestnut stumps in
Leckhampton Avenue.

  The rooted branch of the
fallen golden poplar has
broken away from the tree and
is now independent.

May 25.
   .A branch about 7 in. dia.
fell off a horse-chestnut tree in
the belt in front of the Plant
Breeding Institute.  It broke in
the middle of a straight unbranched
length, and from rhe degree of wilting
probably fell on the fairly calm day

[13184-13185]

23. About half the diameter of
the branch, round the pith, is oc-
cupied by a wet-wood-type discolour
ation.  Affected wood fawn, with a
sharp slightly darker margin, at 
present dry, quite hard and sound.
The discolouration apparently runs
out into some small snags.
