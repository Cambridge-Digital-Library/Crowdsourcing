a single plant between the
railway and Mr Cox's concrete

   Melampyrium cristatum:
emergent seedlings in several
places.

plant from last year. [SYMBOL] 29
   Calamontha frequent in
ballast.
   Much of the northern ex-
-wood verge is covered with
Filipendula.  On the ex-field
verge. This is confined to the 
verge ditch.

quently colonizes the thinner
