Most of the rock is bare

plants growing in cracks.

The most thermophilous

and producing different
symptoms, is common
below Otz.  It was seen
in pines in the Auer
Klamm.  It is abundant
on and around Durnberg,
where over 70% of the
trees appear to be af=
fected (probably more, since
the symptoms cannot easily
be seen from the ground).
It has not been seen
on other conifers, even
where mixed with in-
fected pine.  In the Klamm
the parasite grows in
small bushes.  On the
upper branches, in the
familiar habit.  In the

M: Mistletoe in pine
mainly on the terunk,
giving rise to rugged
swellings.  The primary
infection is usually
at least 30 ft from the
ground, and bears
a few small twigs of

[5978-5979]
mistletoe.  Secondary in-
fections occur higher
on the trunk and on
lateral branches.  The
mistletoe may appear
as short twigs or as
a witches' broom of small
twigs, but is rarely
more than 3 in. long.  The
damage appears to be
in the damage to timber,
the early death of
branches, and perhaps
a reduction of growth.
On the steep meadows
by the Auer Klamm.
Trollius is abundant.
Hepatica and Maian-
themum, also Gentiana
Kchiana, occur at the
edges of thickets. Hepa=
tica is nearly over, Gen=
tiana well open, and
Maianthemum not quite
open.
Ivy climbs up over=
hanging S. facingrocks
in the Klamm, but
has not been seen
elsewhere in Tirol.
A fasciated dande
lion at Sautens has
a very large slightly
flattened stalk bearing
4 slightly fused heads
in a row.
Belliastrum is abun-
dant in the pine woods.
Peucedanum oreoselinum
has the taste and smell of parsley.




[5980-5981]
Polygonatum leaves have
a sweet taste
The Sambucus in the
district is mainly S. race-
mosa.  S nigra occurs
along the Ache.

Pinus cembra in Horlachtal
The first trees appear
at around 1,300m., near
the top of the Stuiben-
fall.  The tree is abundant
along the way to Nieder-
thai, locally dominant.
In Horlachtal it appears
to be a considerable
constituent of the forest,
though not dominant.
This tree is presumably
that which reaches 2,300m.
