and producing different
symptoms, is common
below Otz.  It was seen
in pines in the Auer
Klamm.  It is abundant
on and around Durnberg,
where over 70% of the
trees appear to be af=
fected (probably more, since
the symptoms cannot easily
be seen from the ground).
It has not been seen
on other conifers, even
where mixed with in-
fected pine.  In the Klamm
the parasite grows in
small bushes.  On the
upper branches, in the
familiar habit.  In the

mainly on the terunk,
giving rise to rugged

infection is usually
at least 30 ft from the
ground, and bears
a few small twigs of

[5978-5979]
mistletoe.  Secondary in-
fections occur higher
on the trunk and on
lateral branches.  The
mistletoe may appear
as short twigs or as
a witches' broom of small
twigs, but is rarely
more than 3 in. long.  The
damage appears to be
in the damage to timber,
the early death of
branches, and perhaps
a reduction of growth.
On the steep meadows
by the Auer Klamm.
Trollius is abundant.
Hepatica and Maian-
themum, also Gentiana
Kchiana, occur at the
edges of thickets. Hepa=
tica is nearly over, Gen=
tiana well open, and
Maianthemum not quite
open.
Ivy climbs up over=
hanging S. facingrocks
in the Klamm, but
has not been seen
elsewhere in Tirol.
A fasciated dande
lion at Sautens has
a very large slightly
flattened stalk bearing
4 slightly fused heads
in a row.
Belliastrum is abun-
dant in the pine woods.
Peucedanum oreoselinum
has the taste and smell of parsley.

Polygonatum leaves have

The Sambucus in the

Pinus cembra in Horlachtal
The first trees appear
at around 1,300m., near
the top of the Stuiben-
fall.  The tree is abundant
along the way to Nieder-
thai, locally dominant.
In Horlachtal it appears
to be a considerable
constituent of the forest,
though not dominant.
This tree is presumably
that which reaches 2,300m.

the much larger area
to the E.  Both are similar,
the latter more densely
foprested.  The blocks are
up tothe size of a house,
mostly smaller, without
exception thickly over-
grown with mosses and 
lichens and nearly always
immovable.  The smaller
interstices are firmly 
bridged with mosses and 
tree roots.  The larger
holes have cold draughts
coming out.  No ice was
found in them (though 
some snow was found
in the bottom of the
Kanzeltchuft, on the
mountain N. of the lake).
Around a large hole, the
Selaginella grows on
the rather dry outer side
of the Canzelberg.
fringing Vaccinium bushes
were still in early bud,
as at 1700m., though all
around the lvs were fully

Armillaria rhizomorphs
were found eg. a stump in

Erica carnea is abun-
dant on the Canzelberg.
Ptilium is abundant in

the woods.  Rhytidiadelphus
loveus occurs in similar situa-
tions, but more rarely.

ccorner, where the mill stream

a small patch of more
complex vegetation including
a reed-bed.  Total area,
several acres.
Erica carnea is fairly
abundant on the Maurach,
less so than Vaccinium spp.
Cladonia alpicola oc-
csionally forms almost 
pure stands, with a little
[6004-6005]
Vaccinium and other Cladonine,

tree-stump);  below this the
soil showed gleying.  This is
probably not common in the 
Maurach.
On the way down from 
Kofels to Umhaufen, large
spruce and larch trees have
been severely damaged,
and a few killed, apparently
by boulders colliding with
the trunk in a washout.
Much of the bark has
been torn off.
Rhytidium nigosum is
abundant in Maurach.
Ptilium occurs in
Maurach, mainly in the 
wetter slopes facing N.E. in
the gorge of the Otzaler Ache.
A large grouse-like
bird, probably a hen Auer-
hahn, was disturbed
near Koifels.

Pinus cembra is rere

A doe was seen in
the fields at Schlatt.  It ran
about making grunting noises,
rather like a growling dog.
Puccinia is abundant
on Berberis vulgaris, mostly
near settlements, though
not always near cornfields.
The aecidia are usually
on the underside of the 
leaves:  usually not more 
than one branch per plant
is severely affected, but these
branches have dense
aecidia on nearly every leaf.
Heavily affected leves are 
much distorted.  Affected bran-
ches sometimes show a
witches-broom effect, sug-
gesting perennial infection.

The site was formerly
very wet, but has dried
[6016-6017]
Showing sites 
of replanting
turves in Barrington 
pit [DIAG]
out very cpnsiderably in
the past two years. It
consists of fine chalk mud
at least 1 ft deep.  Most
of the roots are in the
top 2 in.but some pene-
trate much further along
cracks in the mud.  The
vegetation is a short
irregular turf.
the original Eriophorum
site is in the older part
of the pit, near its E. end.
The plant was so diminished
by drying out as to be
hardly distinguished.  It
dsid not flower last ywar.
As gthesite is to be buried,
about 10 sq ft of turf
werew cut out and replaced
[6018-6019]
in a much wetter situation
in two places by an artip
ficial stream leading into
the W. end of the old
pit (i.e. near the middle of
the whole excavation).
The vegetatkon of
the old pit is interesting
nd complex, ranging from
chalk grassland to Epi-
lobium hirsutum and 
Gamlingay Great Heath.
A planted woodland, 
mainly Cstanea (formerly
cppiced, now withg im-
posing old stools,), birch,
and GTurkey oak.  About
a dozen pigs have been
kept in it for many
years, and the ground flora
is impoveriashed.
The soil is greensand,
which often lies at the
surface in the form of
fragments of shell-carr
with the consistency and
appearance of cement roof-
tiles.  It is swampy in
places.
There are fragments of 
the original heath, with
gorse, broom, and mountain
ash.
The commonest mosses
are Mnium hornum (on
stumps) and Orthodontium
lineare (on stumps, banks,
tree roots, and the rootings
