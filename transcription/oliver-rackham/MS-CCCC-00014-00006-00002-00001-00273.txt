Forest Dept ("Hammonasset For-

[21148-21149]
1148
storey trees have recently been
sold (individually marked) to wood-
cutters who have felled them. This
has the effeft of slightly opening
the canopy: it does not amount 
to a proper coppicing.
  Most of the road frontages
have been sold to individuals
who have built houses in 2-cre 
plots. Usually a small area round
the house is grubbed and made
into a garden with lawn. Houses
are framed, often with jetties.
The Houston  house is about 15
years okd and was one of the first.

Experimental burning of litter.
  This wood is on rather deep
acid soil with occasional protru-
ding rock. Slopes down to a sub-
stantial field - wall with a few big
black oaks and other trees in the 
wall. Oaks very spreadng in habit,
like hedgerow Q. robur; trunks c.
3 ft dia.,now declining, though pre-
sumably y9unger than the wall.
  This part of the abandoned
field very quickly became wood-
land; the seed parents were black
oak & black cherry in the hedge.
Most of the cherry has now died
out but has left viable buried
seed. Many oaks show fire scars

lates dead material, and loses
vigour.
  Vaccinium corymbosum needs
protection from fire.
  Rubus flagellaris is the com-
monest bramble. Like all N
American brambles it is weak,
though thorny; its stems arch
and root and are a tripping 
hazard.
  The slow establishment of sec.
woodland on this site appears to
be unusual.

Ants, worms, Moles etc.
  No anthills seen on this site
or in any other such area. The
1157
local ants appear not to form
them.
  Moles said to be indigenous
but not seen here or elsewhere.
  Earthworm activity evidently
weak.
  No rodent burrows observed.

etum maintained as an exam-

  Pinus strobus prominent here

cinium corymbosum forms 
a multi-stem tree with the
habit of hazel, some 15 ft high,

Elms. A number are left in New
London.

North Branford and North Guilford.
Some agricultural remains in
this area. Mainly pastures of
semi-improved grass (but full of
dandelions).
  Erratically-winding roads
much as in England. Scattered
farms with barns and silos. 
Not many new buildings. Much
hay is evidently cut. A few
pastures are in esrly stages of
succession. Hedges are numer-
1159
ous, both on walls and without
walls (i.e. on the flat ground, as
the one on p. 1155). By no means
all field or road boundaries
have hedges.
  Hedges are always mixed, ir-
regular, probably natural in origin,
not cut or plashed. They nor-
mally consist of rows of tall
but young trees. It is rarely
possible to distinguish a separ-
ate class of hedgerow trees.
  Woods irregularly scattered
among farmland, mainly on 
steeper slopes.
  Most farms have a few big
shade-trees and an orchard.

Woodland Management.
  Throughout Conn. and Mass.
[21160-21161]
1160
little felling or other management
was seen. The estimate of felling
half growth (p. 1158) is sur-
prisingly high.

Gipsy Moths.
At Madison about half the
caterpillers have emerged.

6 May.
Fire. Burnt area of about
4 acres between Madison & New 
Haven. Mainly Phragmites, some
spread into surrounding woods
and scattered trees. Fires are 
said to be associated with rail-
roads.
  D. Houston says that when he
was working as a firewarden in
Washington Stte he once found
a fire certainly started by a
bottle. It had spread in a triangle
up a hillside and the original bot-
tle was found at the bottom apex of
the triangle.
  In the western States fires
are often started by lightning. They
may start on old snags which
remain dormant ("sleepers") for

Near-regular grid of biggish fields

both directions intersected by

not quite regular in that some
hedges are missing and others
interpolated. All axes are hedges
apparently tall and lacking dis-
tinct hedgerow trees. Soil mainly
dark, with irregular light pat-
ches recalling stripe-polygon trans-
ition. Terrain extremely flat.
Woodlots of c. 50-100ac. inter-
spersed irregularly among the 
hedges. Their boundaries are
sometimes perfectly straight, con-
forming to the grid; sinuous
and nonconforming straight
edges are common. Woods
are deciduous, no evidence of
management: few emergent

This is now mapped as "Westridge

  Oaks evenly scattered in grass-
land, apparently of Agrostis, Trifol-
ium, Taraxacum. No native herbs
seen.
  The area was a graveyard. The
bones are said to have been moved
elsewhere (according to a plaque).
It has been a public park for
about 100 years.
  Other bur oaks of about the
same age are scattered in the sur-
rounding area among big frame

Chipmunk. Glimpsed in grass near
