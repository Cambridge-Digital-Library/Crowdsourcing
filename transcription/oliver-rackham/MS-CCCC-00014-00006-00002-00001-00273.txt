dark sandy brown - darker than

an area of about 200 acres of
secondary forest surrounded by
a belt of houses in 2-acre
wooded plots.

to roadsides and old walls.
Wood belongs to the State 
Forest Dept ("Hammonasset For-
est"). The smaller and under-
[21148-21149]
1148
storey trees have recently been
sold (individually marked) to wood-
cutters who have felled them. This
has the effeft of slightly opening
the canopy: it does not amount 
to a proper coppicing.
  Most of the road frontages
have been sold to individuals
who have built houses in 2-cre 
plots. Usually a small area round
the house is grubbed and made
into a garden with lawn. Houses
are framed, often with jetties.
The Houston  house is about 15
years okd and was one of the first.

Black cherry seedling - v.

Experimental burning of litter.
  This wood is on rather deep
acid soil with occasional protru-
ding rock. Slopes down to a sub-
stantial field - wall with a few big
black oaks and other trees in the 
wall. Oaks very spreadng in habit,
like hedgerow Q. robur; trunks c.
3 ft dia.,now declining, though pre-
sumably y9unger than the wall.
  This part of the abandoned
field very quickly became wood-
land; the seed parents were black
oak & black cherry in the hedge.
Most of the cherry has now died
out but has left viable buried
seed. Many oaks show fire scars

Salvage of chestnut  After the
death of chestnut timber companies
sought out and harvested the dead
trees in most of the State. This took
many  years.
Turnover of chestnut. about 10
yers. Suckers come up and grow
for that time before the disease
catches up with them.

Deer: legal kills roughly equal to
highway kills.
Paul Herig counts deer by
helicopter in Conn. Best done in
winter. Otherwise the only method
of estimating numbers is by
marking and recapture.
