July 15.
Elm disease.
  The only active site between
Cambridge & Trumpington is in
the tall elm severely lopped
2 years ago and in its neigh-
bours.
The lopped tree is U.
cf procera, now c. 60 ft high,
with an erect trunk and several
branch stubs to c 6 ft long.
Last year it produced many epi-
cormic shoots on all the branch
stubs, some of which were in-
fected.
  This year the infection has
increased to involve about 1/4
of the epicormics, which tend 
to be on one side of the trunk
from top to bottom.  These have
[15964-15965]
5964
wilted & died at intervsls over
the last 3 weeks.  Each epicormic
dies ar once, not progressively.
No hooking of shoot ends this
season.
  Scattered shoots infected
on other lopped trees, main-
ly carpinifolia, alongside.
Also a few small branches
in an unlopped but vigorously
growing elm.
   Unaffected epicormics grow
with undiminished vigour.

  The top 3 ft of an U. pro-
cera by Trumpington Road in
the Leys School has died
rapidly.  Tree c. 40 ft high,
not mature.

  Rotavating to replace rabbit
activity.
  Shore-line birches estab-
lished during the war, when
rabbits were reduced.
  Recent birches in wet
hollows very small owing to
rabbit attack.

Corynephorus.
  On slope formoing edge of
very large old blow-out, on
front of Carex arenaria area.
Nearly continuous Polytrichum
mat with some Cladonia im-
5967
pexia & other lichens.
  Many of the Corynephorus
plants are in gaps c. 3 in wide
in the Polytrichum mat.
These are perhaps caused
by little mounds of blown
sand building up around the
Conyne. tufts. Some Conyne.
plants grow out of the uninter-
rupted moss mat.
  There are about 2 acres of
bare sand.
  The N.W. edge of the Warren
slopes down abruptly into a fen.
The actual bpundary is undermar-
cated. Mainly Dactylis with some
Phragmites. Has evidently been
neglected for many years, but
[15968-15969]
5968
is getting bushed-over (Salix
caprea, cinerea, &c) only slowly.
Adjoins a rough and irregular
alder wood on the N. E.: this is
separated by a drove with
ditches either side.
  A disused ditch crosses
the S.E. part of the fen roughly
parallel to the boundary of
the sand rise. This contains:
Potent palustra
Hydrocotyle
Cx [!!!!approp] * elata. About
6 tussocks c. 2 ft high, sparsely
flowering. There are seversl other 
tussocks, all ruinous, scattered
over the fen.
  Pits in three places showed
alternate layers of peat snd
sand. At least 3 1/2ft down to
5969
water-table.
Fen has evidently declined
severely through lack of grszing
and too much drainage.
