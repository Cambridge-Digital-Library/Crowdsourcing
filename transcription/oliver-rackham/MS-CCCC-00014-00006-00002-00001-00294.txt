      BRADFIELD WOODS.
Diebsck of Lime. In Cambridge
and all over Suffolk trees of
Tilia vulgaris show single twigs
and branches prematurely yellow.
Affected foliage is sharply de-
marcated, bright yellow against
green of crown. Usually about
1 sq. ft is affected at once, but
sometimes larger areas; looks
from a distance like early mul-
[22800-22801]
2800
tiple infection by DED.
Tilia cordata (Lavenham
churchyard and Kentwell Avenue)
is quite unaffected. The Lavenham
limes are very sma=all-leaved and
rather thin in the crown, but have
apparently wasted their substance
on exceptional flowering.

Dieback of Oak. Similar symptoms
abundant in Cambridge, less com-
mon elsewhere. The Great Oak of
Melford is unaffected.

      Boynton-End Vineyard
       (Stoke-by-Clare)
717442.
About 4 ac. of vines in a 5-ac.
field, slope about 6" E.S.E., sur-
rounded by tall mixed hedges with
2801
much ash and elm (Uc). The
owner regards wind as the chief
enemy of vines.
   Vines are grown 1 1/4 m apart,
21/2 m between rows, on fences
1 1/4 m high of wires strained
between stakes. All stkes are
chestnut.
   Vines are elaborately trained
in an espalier shape.
   Huxelrebe was damaged by
winter cold (-17o for 2 days)
which killed some of the buds. It
comes early into leaf. The canes
intended to fruit were trained
as espaliers but this year were
killed (almost to a man) by 
May frosts.
   Muller-Thurgan came later
into leaf and was only slightly
[22802-22803]
2802
damaged by cold or late frost.
This is a robust vine with long
internodes and hence easily
exhausts its stock of apical meri-
stems..
  All vines are grafted.
  Roots are root-pruned to dis-
courage shallow rooting snd pro-
mote drought resistance.
  Little Bordeaux used.
  Rows are individually netted,
the grapes being enclosed between
strips of netting. Vineyard is rab-
bit-fenced.
   Vineyard stsrted 1977.
   Wines are made & bottled on
the estate using the latest German
machinery.
   Soil:  clay, some sand & loess.
   Fine apparently Elizabethan
2803
3-celled house, high and narrow
(higher than medieval houses)
with chimney coming exactly
through the ridge of the roof.
Farm buildings, now used for
wine, are all 19th-cent.

Wines. Muler-Thurgan 1980 is
a light acid wine with a powerful
flowery aroma and a fruity taste
strongly reminiscent of the foxy
wines of New York State.
Huxeliebe 1978 similar but
very dry & acid and less foxy.
M.-Th 1977: much less acid,
distinctly sweeter, not foxy.

in cutting is largely of ash, a

sandy hilltop woth groups of
Pinus austiaca & chestnuts,
remaining from the parks of
large villas, long since subivided.
Several big gnarled oaks, some
pollarded. many dead,appear
to remain from the roadside.
