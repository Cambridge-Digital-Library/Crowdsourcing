      BRADFIELD WOODS.
Diebsck of Lime. In Cambridge
and all over Suffolk trees of
Tilia vulgaris show single twigs
and branches prematurely yellow.
Affected foliage is sharply de-
marcated, bright yellow against
green of crown. Usually about
1 sq. ft is affected at once, but
sometimes larger areas; looks
from a distance like early mul-
[22800-22801]
2800
tiple infection by DED.
Tilia cordata (Lavenham
churchyard and Kentwell Avenue)
is quite unaffected. The Lavenham
limes are very sma=all-leaved and
rather thin in the crown, but have
apparently wasted their substance
on exceptional flowering.

Dieback of Oak. Similar symptoms
abundant in Cambridge, less com-
mon elsewhere. The Great Oak of
Melford is unaffected.

      Boynton-End Vineyard
       (Stoke-by-Clare)
717442.
About 4 ac. of vines in a 5-ac.
field, slope about 6" E.S.E., sur-
rounded by tall mixed hedges with
2801
much ash and elm (Uc). The
owner regards wind as the chief
enemy of vines.
   Vines are grown 1 1/4 m apart,
21/2 m between rows, on fences
1 1/4 m high of wires strained
between stakes. All stkes are
chestnut.
   Vines are elaborately trained
in an espalier shape.
   Huxelrebe was damaged by
winter cold (-17o for 2 days)
which killed some of the buds. It
comes early into leaf. The canes
intended to fruit were trained
as espaliers but this year were
killed (almost to a man) by 
May frosts.
   Muller-Thurgan came later
into leaf and was only slightly
[22802-22803]
2802
damaged by cold or late frost.
This is a robust vine with long
internodes and hence easily
exhausts its stock of apical meri-
stems..
  All vines are grafted.
  Roots are root-pruned to dis-
courage shallow rooting snd pro-
mote drought resistance.
  Little Bordeaux used.
  Rows are individually netted,
the grapes being enclosed between
strips of netting. Vineyard is rab-
bit-fenced.
   Vineyard stsrted 1977.
   Wines are made & bottled on
the estate using the latest German
machinery.
   Soil:  clay, some sand & loess.
   Fine apparently Elizabethan
2803
3-celled house, high and narrow
(higher than medieval houses)
with chimney coming exactly
through the ridge of the roof.
Farm buildings, now used for
wine, are all 19th-cent.

Wines. Muler-Thurgan 1980 is
a light acid wine with a powerful
flowery aroma and a fruity taste
strongly reminiscent of the foxy
wines of New York State.
Huxeliebe 1978 similar but
very dry & acid and less foxy.
M.-Th 1977: much less acid,
distinctly sweeter, not foxy.

above small woods.

Maidenhall, Stoke-by-Ipswich. A
sandy hilltop woth groups of
Pinus austiaca & chestnuts,
remaining from the parks of
large villas, long since subivided.
Several big gnarled oaks, some
pollarded. many dead, appear

One of these oaks, long dead,
has been sawn off
about 7 ft up and    [DIAG]
from its interior
there grows a
large birch, some
50 ft high, over-
hanging the road.
   The descent
to Belstead Bridge
is by a holloway
overhung with
great oaks.
2807
Fragments of chestnut-wood
alongside, but no appearance
of antiquity. Plants in holloway
include mercury and Poa nemor-
alis.

Vslley fens around Bentley Old
Hsll Wood and its neighbours.
Evidently grazed until a few years
ago, but now neglected with docks,
nettles & willowherb. Some grassland
remains.

Bentley railway-bridges. Both

unaisled building,
with brick gables
and framed sidewalls.
At least 200ft
long in many

to be sparse.

Hailey Wood, Sapperton.
N of railway mainly singled
large polesized trees of birch,
sycamore. beech, occ. oak, many
conifers (larch, Thuja) of similar
sizes. Very clear beneath owing
to recent thinning. Almost no

Elms. No elms at all seen in
the Forest of Dean or its sur-
roundings, until Longhope.
In the garden of Brisn Cave
at Longhope is an elm c. 20
ft high and 8" thick. This is 
[22814-22815]
2814
undoubtedly Up - leaves &
bark typical. It does, however, 
form strong corky flanges to the
twigs. It has been repeatedly
singed by DED for several years,
with many dead outlying twigs.
Up is common in hedges at 
Longhope.

Magnificent mixwed hedges in
he Longhope -Flaxley area.

Great Winter. Reached -20oC in
Longhope.
  Several ilexes have made
little new growth - dead leaves
still on trees. Regrowth is slow &
sparse; evidently many buds have
been killed.

The Cotswold plateau above
Sapperton snd round Cirencester
is a district of stone field-walls
in straight lines. Some mixed
hedges, which are sinuous. Some straight
pure elm or hawthorn hedges.
The Foss Way is lined with
mixed hedges which are straight 
and parallel, leaving only a nar-
row verge. Hazel & maple.
   Similar hedge on Ermine Way
for a few miles S.E. of Cirencester:
only the S.w. hedge survives, Hazel

2818
Duke's Brake. Intact, much larch.

Hedges. More straight mixed hedges
on both sides of Ermine Street between

& native woodland. Said to be a 
site of Euphorbia stricta.

Field trees. Many scattered ancient
oaks, mostly not pollards, in fields
around Hsresfield.

River Thames. At Kemble a mere
channel through pasture, has evidently
not had water for many years.

Tbames & Severn Canal. Long dry;
at Kemble on an embankment; the
road bridge has disapeared; almost
completely gone at Cricklade.

2821
Vineyards. Those of Burgundy
(Nuits-St-Georges, Aloxe-Corton, Beaune,
Volnay, Meursault, Puligny-Mont-
rachet) are on the slopes of a
gentle S-facing scarp crowned
with woods. Abut an eighth
of the area appears to be fallow
from vines.

u/w.

Robinia is very common on
railway earthworks all through 
Burgundy.

of Salix alba. Much planting of
[22822-22823]
2822
poplars, & Robinia invasion at

Millet. Some fields df it near
Leyment - ?Sorghum halepense.

Woods of the Jura gorge. Ambe-
neu to Rossillon.
Limestone gorge with  [DIAG]
cliffs and wooded

the screes and
talus.
2823
Elms Rare in Lyonnais. A few
dead ones at Meximieux.
Occ dead near Rossillon.
--------------------------------
Screes mostly stable and vegetated
but some areas of scree many
acres in extent have only scat-
tered bushes. Judging by the
effect of road-works, however,
even these unvegetated screes
are stable.
Talus is mainly woodland;
in places there are vineyards on S.W.
and occasionally N.W.-facing slopes
these appear to be in decline.
   Commonest woodland is
lime-ash; this on established
talus snd deeper soils over rock,
mainly on aspects with some north
About half lime (mainly
some co-data), evenly interspersed
[22824-22825]

At base of slope freq. hazel and syca-
more. Robinia only in neighbour-
hood of railway.

with some sorbus cf aria; stools
low, often discontinuous.
   Oak present only in the eE
around Rossillon; may be pubes-
cens.
   Occasional pine and Picea
near Rossillon.
   These woods appear to be all
2805
coppices, probably of c. 20-40 
years' growth. No giant stools
seen. Not much felliong in recent
years; where there has been some
it is in strips up & down slope.
   Alder-wods along river,
much altered & poplanized. 
Fruiting of Ash. About 1 tree in
3 is heavily fruiting. With many
of these fruits are more abundant
than leaves, and the trees are
heavily chlorotic.
Morain de Chautagne. Alder
extensively killed or damaged
prob. by fire in reedbeds.

Warm sticky day in Chambery,

   No lime visible.
Aspen loc. ab. - a faster grower
than the other spp.
   Occasional beech at Les Martins.
   Cherry ab. in small groves and
on edge of gorges.
Chestnut appears to be
mainly on Burdigalian rather
than on moraine.

Woodland herbs. Euphorbia amyg.\occ in redcent clesring.
Prenanthus freq. in deep shade.
Oxlip rare, in damp shade. Leaves
still fully turgid. No sign of ny

B. ash in 
Montfort.

Ash fruiting. About 1 ash in 2 is
fruiting. About 1 ash in 4 in
woodland has fruits which out-
weigh leaves; often there are
hardly any leaves visible. This
may be an effect of the drought
[228323-22833]
2832
in August this year.

Moraine. Composed of unsorted
sand, gravel, and boulders, of
a great variety of materials
much of them sioiceous. Pebbles

herbs, e.g. Salvia horminoides,
succisa etc.
  Unusual numbers of cattle,
a few sheep; very little arable
land.
  Small strip of Carex fen in the
dry valley of Vachet.
  This area is becoming sub-
urbanized with much new buil-
2833
ding, but most farms remain
active.

Ball Lightning. M. Vuillermet
says there was an occurrence here
in August 19778. In a violent
storm a poplar-tree outdside was
struck and a bolide appeared
in the salle de sejour downstairs.
It was resddish-yellow and
lasted only a few seconds, it
then apparently disappeared. The
witness had been writing; her
ball-point was never seen again.

Robinia. Heavy, even excessive,
flowering of some trees - but less
than of ash.

Scree. Very little on this side of the
