Göß Falls.
The rock changes from
a gneiss with mica flakes
in Brandwald to a moderately
fine - grained granite with
good phenocrysts on the
N. side of the Göß.

Populus tremula: abun-
dant along the Göß falls,
as a fringe and seldom more
than 30 yards from them.
Small trees.
Mercury scattered in the
woods by the Göß falls.


Impatiens - noli-tangere rare

by the Göß falls.
The Göß has three suc-
cessive falls Upper, p. 3644.
Middle, Φ 36. Lower, p. 36, 3.
In each case, the water
slides diagonally over polished
rocks. At the upper fall there
is a small electricity works
with an ingenious wooden
bridge carrying a pipe over 
the river.

Maltatal from Sonnlick to
Melnik Wasserfall.
A wild narrow U-shaped 
valley with occasional pastures
only along the bottom. Cliffs
of black rock hem it in and
most of the waterfalls are over

Hochsteg.

these.
Woods contain a lot of
larch and birch, epsecially the
latter in inaccessible places.
A strip of Alnus incana along
the stream.
Tarred road as fara as
Kerschhakl Alm. Motoring is
possible up to the Gonünder Hütte,
the road being rough and very
steep and subject to toll.
Little can be seen of the
higher mountains.
At Pflüglhof is a curious
wooden bridge resting on two
cables. Φ4.
At the Schleierfall (Φ 5)
a stream falls over a projecting
cliff. It is spread out by a

[!!!!]3703[!!!!]3673
curved rock on the edge. It 
is moved from side to side by the
wind and [!!!!]moved[!!!!]blown away altogether
at times.                 Φ5.
The Faller Tumpf is a series of cascades in the
main Malta river (Φ 6).
Very varied. In one place
it thunders through a
narrow fissure with numer-
ous eddy cavities.
Another lateral fall on the
Reutnerbach.
At the Hochsteg the river
passes through a narrow
crack about 100 ft deep
and 20 ft wide at the top.
It is sinuous and narrower
at the top than the bottom.

[13674-13675]

The ancient and modern
bridges start from a big over-
hang and do not pass di-
rectly above the water at all.
The Melnik fall is a
series of cascades on a powerful
tributary. Φ 7. Φ8 shows
the revetments of log crab-work
on the stream below the
fall, and the rickety bridge
carrying the road to Unter[????]
Feidlbauer Alm.
