At the Schleierfall (Φ 5)
a stream falls over a projecting
cliff. It is spread out by a

is moved from side to side by the
wind and [!!!!]moved[!!!!]blown away altogether
at times.                 Φ5.
The Faller Tumpf is a series of cascades in the
main Malta river (Φ 6).
Very varied. In one place
it thunders through a
narrow fissure with numer-
ous eddy cavities.
Another lateral fall on the
Reutnerbach.
At the Hochsteg the river
passes through a narrow

It is sinuous and narrower

This area is typical of the

The valley floor in lower

mainly grassland and maize,
fenced in large blocks, with
few or no hedges.

very slender shape. Visited that
afternoon by a party with a

[13688-13689]
3688
guide.
The Adangkamin appears
to have been altered by the 
fairly recent collapse of a
mass of rock some hundreds
of feet high from the upper
part.  Φ 17.
In addition to the 10 main
peaks in the Pizzes da Čir,
there are numerous bizarre
pinnacles in the wild plateau
to the E. around Jéuf da Cir.
Φ 29.
No new snow on the Sella;
patches of old snow remain

Val Séttus.

3689
Like a small Val Mesdi
with much less scree. A grim
and plantless gulch, traversed
by the Aufzug cables to the
Pišadúseehütte. Opens between
two towering vertical cliffs.
The start of the via ferrata,
or Klettersteig, onto the middle 
terrace by the Pišadú.
The stratigraphic relation
between the "volcanic" rocks
of the Grödner Joch and the
dolomite is rather complex.
The Joch is a gentle ridge
of the former thinly covered
with [!!!!]da[!!!!] mainly dolomite scree.
At A in the sketch it runs
up over the lower cliffs of
the Sella, which it buries,

[13690-13691]
3690
apparently continuing under
the main dolomite screes of
Sass dla lúesa. At B there
are outcrops of the volcanic
on top of the dolomite lover
cliffs.  Φ 25, 2[!!!!]&[!!!!]8.
The middle Sella plateau
in the Pišadú region is very
evenly planed offl a huge
detached portion is known as
the Exnerturm.
The Stevía and other
ranges about Wolkenstein are
grassy plateaux with small
amounts of Latschen at their
lower edges. The relation be-
tween grass and Latschen is
not different on isolated and
apparently cliff-bound ungraze-

3691
able blocks.  Φ 20.
On returning by the Čampač
route from Grödnerjoch to Col-
fuschg, extensive earth-
-mobing works were met
in Edelweißtal and its branch
going up behind Col Livinà.
A broad strip of earth,
about 200 ft wide, is being
gouged out and graded to
about 1 in 6. Much felling
of Cir and Latschen. The
footpath is interrupted and
it would have been difficult
to find the way without
local knowledge. Blasting was
going on about 6 p.n. and
rock fragments had been
scattered over the path with-

[13692-13693]
3692
out any warning to passers-
-by. Considerable disturbance
in Edelweißtal itself. The
old village is disturbed and
its buildings damaged by
large lorries grinding up
and down the hill.

Vast undulating mea-
dowsd, now mostly mown off

The following is an attempt
to reconcile the stratigraphy
of the two sides of the
Grödner Joch. As seen from
Pralonğa (Φ 35), the N. side
has a terrace structure corres-

3699
Onobrychis montana is abun-
dant in this area, and often
still flowering. Stem short,
ascending. Fls bright pink.
The general vegetation 
of Pralonğà is moderately
calcareous grassland. Rock
seldom exposed N.W. of Pra-
lonğà hütte, and perhaps volcanic;
to the E. it is a remarkable
soft unstable shale. Some
areas of moderately acid
vegetation (Alnus viridis, &c.).
Very little eutrophication; no
permanent stock.
E. of Pralonğà Hütte is
a ridge of shale with a 
sleep S. face with enormous
wash-outs where the turf

[13700-13701]
3700
has disappeared for a vertical
height of perhaps 150 m.
leaving a crumbling gullied
face with only pioneer vege-
tation: Φ3. These may not
be wholly natural. On the
edge is a
linear french [DIAG]
in the turf
with backward
salients at 
intervals. This 
is probably Austrian
of World War I. It is now
just large enough to take cover
in but was presumably
deeper when dug. Much
of it is interrupted by the
present cliff edge.

3701
Sett Sass is a long dolomite
mountain with a vertical 
S.W. face. Below this, the
turf is interrupted by long
tracts of huge dolomite boul-
ders with heathland and 
scattered trees (larch to c.
2350 m.) higher than in the 
grassland. Φ 5.
Below Sett Sass. steep
(slideable) slopes lead to the
vast basin of Premaju, like-
wide meadows with scattered
trees and patches of fen.
Mowing no longer done on
the steeper and higher slopes.
Divided by tiny baulks. A
difficult terrain with in-
distinct roads that peter out,

[13702-13703]
3702
undulating ground, few land-
marks, many streams, and 
fog coming on.
Col di Lana is a peak
purple-brown with e[????]ds,
and probably volcanic.
The road over Incisa Joch
is an old gree track, little
used and hard to find
in the open patchy woods.
The Campolongo road is 
intermittently tarred, other-
wise surfaced with limestone.

3703
September 24.
After a dear night,
there was hard frost on
bushes and other plants upUrtica dioica
to nearly midday below
the entrance to Val Meschi.
This frost appears to have 
been limited to the valley
floor in the area shaded
by the cliffs: none was
seen more than about 4 ft
from the ground.
The way into Val Meschi
appears to have suffered
much erosion since 1967.
Closed turf extends up 
to the altitude of the
Pišadù Hütte: mainly Cx
curvula and sempervirens,

[13704-13705]
3704
but quite rich in species
especially in the little
valley where the path as-
cends out of Val Meschi.
Here are:
Urtica dioica
Chenopodium B. Henricus
Phyteuma of hedraianthi-
folium.
On the Pišadù plateau
vegetation covers about 1/3
of the surface. Continuous
turf ceases abruptly at
2600 m.
The way up through Val
Tita is over steep screes
and rocks overhung by the
formidable W. face of Piz
Pišadù. A flat Scharte be-

3705
tween Pišadù and Barn-
berger sp. (Barnberger Sattel)
gives a view of the S.
side of Torr da Pišadù and the 
W. side of Dent da Mesdi.

High Sella plateau.
Poa alpina rare, in 
small illuvial hollows.
Sesleria sphaerocephala
v.r., in small rock
crevices: very small.
Saxifraga oppositifolia
faily freq.
Cerastium sp. much the 
commonest vascular plant.

The Pišadù-Bamberger
Scharte is covered with bare

[13706-13707]
smooth limestone slabs, appar-
ently produced by exfoliation
in horizontal strata. Φ 12.
The Bergerturm (Φ 17) is
an isolated sharp-edged rectan-
gular prism of dolomite.
The rop end of Val Mesdi
begins without warning as a 
fissure in the plateau which
widens into a steep ice-filled
gulley with vertical sides. Very
uninviting, especially as fallen
stones lie on the ice. Φ 18.

Near the edge of the

about 20 ft dia. which
slopes down and out to the

Sella Plateau - 2800-2900 m.
Gently saucer-shaped,

About 90% of the area is
covered with stones (estimated
2 X 10[SYMBOL]). Generally about
1"- 8" long, very angular.
Fines (small stones and
silt) cover about 5%,
chiefly in illuvial hollows.
Not much exposed rock:
closely stratified and very

up to c. 10 ft high. Very

Broad stone lines (with a

This is a small pool surroun-
ded by polygons. Although an
exit channel is shown on the
map none could be seen on the
ground.
The difference of several in.
between the water level of the
mud & the stones in the morning
is remarkable. There must be a
daily cycle, water being drawn
into (or condensed on) the mud
by differential freezing at night
and released in the morning.
