Göß Falls.
The rock changes from
a gneiss with mica flakes
in Brandwald to a moderately
fine - grained granite with
good phenocrysts on the
N. side of the Göß.

Populus tremula: abun-
dant along the Göß falls,
as a fringe and seldom more
than 30 yards from them.
Small trees.
Mercury scattered in the
woods by the Göß falls.

by the Göß falls.
The Göß has three suc-
cessive falls Upper, p. 3644.
Middle, Φ 36. Lower, p. 36, 3.
In each case, the water
slides diagonally over polished
rocks. At the upper fall there
is a small electricity works
with an ingenious wooden
bridge carrying a pipe over 
the river.

Maltatal from Sonnlick to
Melnik Wasserfall.
A wild narrow U-shaped 
valley with occasional pastures
only along the bottom. Cliffs
of black rock hem it in and
most of the waterfalls are over

these.
Woods contain a lot of
larch and birch, epsecially the
latter in inaccessible places.
A strip of Alnus incana along
the stream.
Tarred road as fara as
Kerschhakl Alm. Motoring is
possible up to the Gonünder Hütte,
the road being rough and very
steep and subject to toll.
Little can be seen of the
higher mountains.
At Pflüglhof is a curious
wooden bridge resting on two
cables. Φ4.
At the Schleierfall (Φ 5)
a stream falls over a projecting
cliff. It is spread out by a

[!!!!]3703[!!!!]3673
curved rock on the edge. It 
is moved from side to side by the
wind and [!!!!]moved[!!!!]blown away altogether
at times.                 Φ5.
The Faller Tumpf is a series of cascades in the
main Malta river (Φ 6).
Very varied. In one place
it thunders through a
narrow fissure with numer-
ous eddy cavities.
Another lateral fall on the
Reutnerbach.
At the Hochsteg the river
passes through a narrow
crack about 100 ft deep
and 20 ft wide at the top.
It is sinuous and narrower
at the top than the bottom.

[13674-13675]
[!!!!]3704[!!!!]3674
The ancient and modern
bridges start from a big over-
hang and do not pass di-
rectly above the water at all.
The Melnik fall is a
series of cascades on a powerful
tributary. Φ 7. Φ8 shows
the revetments of log crab-work
on the stream below the
fall, and the rickety bridge
carrying the road to Unter[????]
Feidlbauer Alm.

This area is typical of the
bocage settlements on the
side slopes of Maltatal, with 
steep hedged fields, hamlets

3679
and isolated farms, woods, and
clearings. Cf Maltaberg.
The valley floor in lower
Maltatal is "open-field",
mainly grassland and maize,
fenced in large blocks, with
few or no hedges.

The Jauken and Reißkofl
in the Gailtaler Alps are im-
pressive peaks with rugged
cliffs and narrow gorges. No
evidence from below of the lead
mines near the top. Probably 
dolomite.
Höhlensteintal is a remark-
ably narrow cliff-bound valley.
Antholzertal is a wide
valley penetrating far into the

Val Badia has stabilized
since the 1966 floods, although
the plain of [!!!!]Abtui has[!!!!]St Martin is still
covered over the gravel and
little has been reclaimed.
Frost damage to maize is
most severe in Maltatal.
Frequent in Drautal but
not seen in Pustertal.
The Claras' ivy kept in
a dark inner corner of the
dining-room still grows, but
is very etiolated. windows
of room small, distant, and
obstructed by curtains and
pot plants. Loses its leaves.
Probably need reporting.

At Pezzei, below the
Grödnerjoch road, there is
an obvious planted (tho'
neglected) headge, marking
a boundary between mea-
dow and waste.

The "roof" of Pizza da Čir
is a rocky slope of about 40°
facing S. Broken turf extends
from about 2400 m. to the 
summit.
An easy peak, though
somewhat vertiginous from its

very slender shape. Visited that
afternoon by a party with a

[13688-13689]
3688
guide.
The Adangkamin appears
to have been altered by the 
fairly recent collapse of a
mass of rock some hundreds
of feet high from the upper
part.  Φ 17.
In addition to the 10 main
peaks in the Pizzes da Čir,
there are numerous bizarre
pinnacles in the wild plateau
to the E. around Jéuf da Cir.
Φ 29.
No new snow on the Sella;
patches of old snow remain
under the Meisules on the middle
terraces.

Val Séttus.

3689
Like a small Val Mesdi
with much less scree. A grim
and plantless gulch, traversed
by the Aufzug cables to the
Pišadúseehütte. Opens between
two towering vertical cliffs.
The start of the via ferrata,
or Klettersteig, onto the middle 
terrace by the Pišadú.
The stratigraphic relation
between the "volcanic" rocks
of the Grödner Joch and the
dolomite is rather complex.
The Joch is a gentle ridge
of the former thinly covered
with [!!!!]da[!!!!] mainly dolomite scree.
At A in the sketch it runs
up over the lower cliffs of
the Sella, which it buries,

[13690-13691]
3690
apparently continuing under
the main dolomite screes of
Sass dla lúesa. At B there
are outcrops of the volcanic
on top of the dolomite lover
cliffs.  Φ 25, 2[!!!!]&[!!!!]8.
The middle Sella plateau
in the Pišadú region is very
evenly planed offl a huge
detached portion is known as
the Exnerturm.
The Stevía and other
ranges about Wolkenstein are
grassy plateaux with small
amounts of Latschen at their
lower edges. The relation be-
tween grass and Latschen is
not different on isolated and
apparently cliff-bound ungraze-

3691
able blocks.  Φ 20.
On returning by the Čampač
route from Grödnerjoch to Col-
fuschg, extensive earth-
-mobing works were met
in Edelweißtal and its branch
going up behind Col Livinà.
A broad strip of earth,
about 200 ft wide, is being
gouged out and graded to
about 1 in 6. Much felling
of Cir and Latschen. The
footpath is interrupted and
it would have been difficult
to find the way without
local knowledge. Blasting was
going on about 6 p.n. and
rock fragments had been
scattered over the path with-

[13692-13693]
3692
out any warning to passers-
-by. Considerable disturbance
in Edelweißtal itself. The
old village is disturbed and
its buildings damaged by
large lorries grinding up
and down the hill.

Spetember 23.
Ruones and Pralonģa.
Vast undulating mea-
dowsd, now mostly mown off
and occasionally grazed by
inter alia a bull. Trans-
ition to forest rather gradual,
with numerous probably
relict groves and isolated
trees, none of them very
old. Mainly spruce & larch.
