perate and moribund nearby.

Habitats
Generally favoured by a 
combination of light and shelter.
Oak: several spp. confined
to pollards; standard trees un-
interesting, even where over-
mature, because too shaded
at base.
[4138-4139]
4138
Elm: richest habitat is
near enough to the E. edge
of the wood to get light;
ancient trees generally the
best.
Ash: best place is the
bases ofpoles arising from
tall ancient stools. The moss
zone on the stool is generally
unproductive. Nothing found
under overhangs on ash
stools. Ash trunks (of old
standards) quite good.
Maple: generally poor.
Rose & Gilbert regard
this as a relict flora rapidly
declining because of air pol-
lution (brick-works and power
4139
stations). Many species are
rare and fail to colonize
trees as they grow up. It
would probably have been much
richer a few decades ago.
Relatively few lichens grow
on mosses.
The Wood is remarkably 
wet. Standing water in some
of the black-holes and hollows
on rides. Flowing water in 
the streams in the S.E. of
the wood and across the S.E.
main ride.
Bluebell leaves fully emerged.
Oxlips almost in flower.

cellent. Density of standards
unsurpassed in BC woodland.

some maple, stool size not
seen.
Both planted c. 7 yrs ago
with Corsican, larch, spruce.
This N. handle of Basefield
Wood is documentarily post-
-1770. Field evidence suggests
slightly greater age than the 
S. part of Marmer's. Some sub-
stantial stools in the E. &
W. boundaries. The strip
4159
next to the road may be no
younger than the rest (despite
the O.S.).
7. Ulmus glabra in quantity.
8. Oxlips (rare) & mercury.
9. Hwthorn apparently all
mono.
Apart from th eN.E. handle,
this wood presents a mixture
of primary and secondary
characteristics. It is probable
that the middle of the S.
side has a history similar
to the S. part of Marmer's.
Probably a dry wood.
Some flow out of the ditches.
