Habitats
Generally favoured by a 
combination of light and shelter.
Oak: several spp. confined
to pollards; standard trees un-
interesting, even where over-
mature, because too shaded
at base.
[4138-4139]
4138
Elm: richest habitat is
near enough to the E. edge
of the wood to get light;
ancient trees generally the
best.
Ash: best place is the
bases ofpoles arising from
tall ancient stools. The moss
zone on the stool is generally
unproductive. Nothing found
under overhangs on ash
stools. Ash trunks (of old
standards) quite good.
Maple: generally poor.
Rose & Gilbert regard
this as a relict flora rapidly
declining because of air pol-
lution (brick-works and power
4139
stations). Many species are
rare and fail to colonize
trees as they grow up. It
would probably have been much
richer a few decades ago.
Relatively few lichens grow
on mosses.
The Wood is remarkably 
wet. Standing water in some
of the black-holes and hollows
on rides. Flowing water in 
the streams in the S.E. of
the wood and across the S.E.
main ride.
Bluebell leaves fully emerged.
Oxlips almost in flower.

This N. handle of Basefield
Wood is documentarily post-
-1770. Field evidence suggests
slightly greater age than the 
S. part of Marmer's. Some sub-
stantial stools in the E. &
W. boundaries. The strip
4159
next to the road may be no
younger than the rest (despite
the O.S.).
7. Ulmus glabra in quantity.
8. Oxlips (rare) & mercury.
9. Hwthorn apparently all
mono.
Apart from th eN.E. handle,
this wood presents a mixture
of primary and secondary
characteristics. It is probable
that the middle of the S.
side has a history similar
to the S. part of Marmer's.
Probably a dry wood.

D. Hawthorn scrub with big
elders. First ash stools. Cle-
matis abundant over scrub,
with large stems.
E. Mixed evergreen scrub
clearly of planted origin. Much
elder, including big over-
-mature trees. Abundant
Clematis. No over-storey of
trees.
F. Straggling ill-defined plan-
tation of beech, ash, spruce,
&c, on level ground and
just into fosse. Trees stunted,
especially the spruce.
G. Fairly abrupt transition in
4171
the Fitch from chalk rubble
and flints to boulder clay.
Vegetation changes to a 
more definite woodland.
H. Woodland on the Ditch is
nearly closed. Ash dom., with
some oak, maple hawthorn,
&c. Classes of trees:
(i) Pollards of oak, ash, and
occasionally maple. Usually 
c. 3 ft (crown dia.) x 7 ft;
sometimes rather bigger,
especially teh oaks, but
none very ancient. At least
[!!!!] one of the larger ash
pollards is promoted from a 
stool.
(ii) Large coppice, scattered
[4172-4173]
4172
stools almost entirely of
ash. Mainly [!!!!] 2-4 ft
x c. 1 1/2 ft; one c. 7 ft dia.
(iii) Numerous over-mature [!!!!]
maiden ash, c. 2 ft dia., 
now falling to pieces. Rings
suggest these startedc. 1800-
-1830.
(iii) Continuous range of 
smaller maiden ash down
to c. 6 in. dia.
(v) Sparse hazel stools.
(vi) Other shrubs & scrub,
including spindle-berry to c.
3" dia.
(vii) Clematis, loc. ab., in
places growing spectacularly
over the ash trees and
reaching nearly 3 in dia.
4173
I. Woodland in the fosse.
Chiefly 1-sroreyed ash &
sycamore LC; stolls c. 3 ft
dia. Not involved in the fel-
long of Pickmore Wood.
J. Narrow steep-sided gap
with a causeway over the 
fosse.
K. Very abrupt end with a 
minor "wood-bank" encircling
its base.
L. Probably coppice-wood
now very effectively cleared,
probably poisoned, and planted
with conifers.
M. Ditch with only the slightest
of banks.
The fosse of the boulder-
[4174-4175]
4174
-clay portion is a flat-
-bottomed v shape and
has standing water.
Mecury is present thro'
out the length explored and
goes on into Stetchworth
Park.
Oxlips few, only in the 
first 50 yards.
There must have been
at least traces of woodland
for some time, as shown
by the old trees. The pol-
lards are presumably at
least 200 years old, some
probablt older. The coppice
stools are very difficult to
4175
date owing to soil variation
and sharp rainage, but
some must be earlier than 
some of the pollards. The num-
ber of pollards (which do 
not define boundaries) and
the conversion of a stool to
a pollard suggest a grazing
episode, which was not
enough to get rid of all the
remaining stools.
There must have been a 
steady increase in woodland
from c. 1780-1850.
The old trees are nearly
all on the Wood Ditton side.
They are seldom continuous
enough to constitute mappable
woodland.
[4176-4177]
4176
In general, the woodland
appears not to be defined by
longitudinal or transverse
banks, but this requires
further study.
Rabbit holes curiously
scarce.
The big spindle and 
Clematis are particularly
notable.

Pickmore Wood.
Earthworks very slight,
especially on the N. and E.
Probably rectilinear. The
S.W. "handle" appears to be
arable.
4177
The unconiferized portion
(a mere belt) is typical of 
E. Cambs, with a well-pre-
served, though overgrown,
structure. No big stools seen.
Standards numerous, moder-
ately large.
Around the E. margin
several oaks of c. 4 ft dia.
have been felled, just in-
side or just outside the 
wood. Probably of c. 1800, 
not pollarded (onc could be
a somewhat older once-cut
pollard).
At least one pollard ash
in the S. border.
A few spruce of c. 100
years old.
[4178-4179]
4178
A few large birches.
Mainly mercury & vlue-
bells. Oxlips [!!!!]
frequent, espcially in 
the felled parts.
Felled areas choked 
with herbaceous vegetation.
No sign of coppice regrowth.
Documentarily an ancient
wood. Lack of big stools is
remarkable: ? earlier replan-
ting (cf DPW). If primary 
it must have been reduced
from a bigger wood (this 
would explain the oxlips &
mercury on the Devil's Ditch).
The only ancient boundary
feature is the pollard in
4179
the S. boundary. the lack 
of a strong bank along the
parish boundary is curious
(but cf Little Widgham, and
DPW).
Rather wetter than 
most of Marmer's or Base-
field.

Marmer's Wood cont.
The Pond.
Apparently 3-armed,
larger than the one im Hay-
ley. Surrounded by 4 biggish
alder stools and much
Carex pendula. Apparent spoil
heap to the S.E.
A grip runs from this
pond through the boundary
[4180-4181]
4180
bank. Strong flow out of
the wood in this grip and
in nearby ditches.
Features
1. Boundary bank variable, 
strong on W. (including secon-
dary portion).
2. Small area of old 2ndary
woodland on W. side.
3. Larger area of younger
2ndary woodland on S. side,
separated from the old wood
by a massive bank.
4. Second Cambs boulder-clay
wood with alder; but only in
sec. woodland.

9. Good, if neglected, structure

10. Interesting elm situation.

The 2ndary woodland area,
of some interest, undoubtedly
represents a clearing within the
original wood-bank. The struc-
ture - largely ash-sycamore
LC - is distinctive, as is
the absence of large stools.
Ivy on ground in part of the
area. Surprisingly little differ-
ence between "Ashbed-grove

Little Meadow" and the wooded
portion on the 1770 map.
the pond complex is im-
portant.
The remainder has many
of the marks of an ancient
wood. The conformity of the 
E. side with field boundaries
is comparatively recent, al-
tho' this side is probably
not along its original line.
the elm invasion appears
in thsi case to have started 
from attached 2ndary woodland,
where two possible parent
trees (both decayed and broken
off) occur.
The slight floristic differ-
ences between the S. part and
4183
teh rest of the wood may be
due to the S. hedge acting as
a refugium.
Note sanicle in S. part.

The field next to the E.
has a [!!!!] meandering boun-
dary with a bank resem-
bling a wood-bank, espe-
4193
cially on the E. side. The
bank of the Grove with this
field is irregular and partly
reversed, suggesting a late
aosart.
In the S.E. corner is
a rectangle with broad
shallow banks like a moat.
South wood-bank 
moderately strong with a small pol-
lard oak.
West bank weak with a 
small pollard oak.
The N. portion of the
Grove (not entered) is more
strongly embanked. Separated
from teh S. part by a ditch
c. 6 ft deep, evdiently a re-
cent drainage work.
[4194-4195]
4194
The S.E. corner is cut
off as a rectangular earth-
work. Similar woodland in-
side this, save for 2 mature
larches on the S. side.
A single hornbeam stool 
c. 3 ft dia. grows near the 
S. margin.
Seveal small holly trees.
A [!!!!] bush inside the wood
near the S.W. corner.
Two large well-defined
bracken glades on the edge of
the N. portion.
Ground vegetation of the S.
portion ranges from pure mer-
cury to pure Rubus (generally
Corylifolii, not caesius). Ox-
lips infrequent, except in a 
4195
small area towards the N.E.
Aspen occurs in a large
group on the S.
Wood management in
the last 2 years consists
of coppicing a strip c. 20
yards wide along the W. and
S. sides and part of the E.
More irregular felling has
gone on in the interior.
There has not been any pre-
vious coppicing for many years.
1. Boundary bank variable;
the E. and W. wides probably 
more recent than the others.*
Few boundary pollards.

bably no primrose.
8. Hawthorn apparently all

9. Hornbeam present.
10. NO ALDER.
Very similar to the N.W.
parts of Monks' Park, the 
chief differences being:
Absence of primroses.
4197
Rather poorer flora.
No Crataegus oxy.
No alder.
Hornbeam present.
Ash stools include some
largish ones but the size
range appears to be cut off
at c. 4 ft.
Field evidence for this as
primary woodland is not
strong; mainly limited to a 
few of the plant species.
The ash stool range suggests
secondary woodland, or drastic
replanting, in the 16th or 17th
cent.
Field evdience is strong 
that the field to E. was
[4198-4199]
4198
once part of the grove; its
wood-bank-like boundary
is characteristic. The field to
teh W. may have been in-
cluded also.
We conclude that though
Chensil Grove is ancient wood-
land and perhaps has some
primary continuity it has
probably been moved around.

Felsham Hall Wood cont.
A patch of garlic about
30 yards dia. was found in
Front Fell (Mar. 27).
Primroses have little in-
creased in the 1970 coppice
4199
although a few plants are
floweing well (Mar. 27).
Anemones are very abun-
dant in parts of the 1970 cop-
pice. Few flowers open but
most are only a few das off
(Mar. 27).

Strawberry Bank Lime
Around the two ancient
stools are four smaller plants
which appear to have arisen
either by suckers or by
coppice stems arching and
rooting. In each case the 
new plant is c. 3 ft - 6 ft away.
No plants nearer the parent.
Limes c. 15 ft high, top 
shoots mainly horizontal, over-
[4200-4201]
4200
topped by ash and birch.
Some of these were felled to
create a canopy gap. A large
ash stool occurs within a 
few feet of one of he limes.
These lime stools (unlike those
in Plantation Fell) have 
a substantial base and
a tendency for the bottom
stems to spread horizontally.

Mr Cullum has cut 
about 6 big ash stools in
Front Fell with a chain
saw to provide fuel. The
tractor has been taken
this far into the wood
without much damaging the
4201
rides, save for a soft place
in the N. part of Front Fell.
There is a small patch of 
a carpinifolia-type elm in the
S.E. of Strawberry Banl. Suck-
ering weak (Mar. 27).
Stilll about 18 in. depth of
water in the Fish-pond (Mar. 
27).
The middle and W. parts 
of Felsham Hall Ride have
been much damaged by the
Hunt )confined by marginal 
bushes to the narrow strip
still usable) (Mar. 27)
Partsof Plantation Fell,
round the old "moat" and
Alison's Pond, have a high
density of maiden pole oaks.
[4202-4203]
4202
Sphagnum
Probably increased. In-
termittently along most of
the Plantation stream, about
100 yards length. Oc-
curs downstream from a 
part of the stream where
it prasses very close to an
oxlip area. Much slow
water in the stream and the 
Sphagnum largely submerged.
(Mar. 27.)
The Bluebell Path, where
formerly prolonged into Front
Fell , is occupied by dense
blackthorn scrub, much of 
which is now dead. An
exit was made at this
4203
point from the 1971 coppice for
hauling timber,
Blackthorn scrub burns
when cut with great ferocity.
Coppice areas (checked
with air photograph):
1970 2.4 acres
1971 Front Fell 1.9 acres
     Middle "  2.7   "
The Foxhunters' elm area
has a rather diffuse margin
with outlying stools usually
much smaller than those in
the interior. No sign of recent
suckering.
Ladybirds are very numerous
on standing trees & wood.

spite last year's fire.
No alder seen on the N.
