1213
  Elm suckers reaching pole size,
then killed by disease, in fen
by road.

  The fen is a swampy stretch
of woodland running S.W. from the
main road. Part of it is open,
partly through grubbing-out
under electricity lines. Fen is
rich in species; an early-fl.
Senecio, now in full flower, is
specially abundant here. Herbs
form a tsll sward about 3 ft
high. Leafing and flowering are
about a month in advance of
English fens.
  East of the fen is a tract
of hollows and pools rather like
the woodland ponds of East Ang-
lia. This area has abundant
[21214-21215]
1214
elm and red maple. Somewhat
peaty in hollows. This area is
a tract along what may have
been once an ill-defined course
of the stream now canalized.
  The wood is otherwise quite
flat.
  Poison ivy is freq. in swampy
area, ab. at edges of wood.
  Edges of wood have no
earthworks. Wood evidently ex-
panded beyond remains of old
sheep-netting fence.
  Probably two ages of stumps.
The ypunger ones are very rotted
and close to big trees; they seem
too old to be due to a small fel-
ling which appears to be recorded
in air photographs in 1960x 7.

dom. Some old mostly dead
sugar maple.
Zantoxylon  b. americanum
Much poison ivy
[21216-21217]
1216
  These hedges are typical of
this area; they divide up fields
of about 70 acres, which are
about 2/3 arable. Probably 2-3
fields per farm.
  Roadside hedge is irregular
and gappy; non-roadside hedge,
like most such, is regular and
probably acts as windbreak. No
evidence of planting or direct
management, although several
spp including Zantoxylon wrre 
not seen in woods in Michigsn.
  Probably about 4 sp. in 30
yds for both hedges.
  Irregular banks of stones,
evidently remved from arable,
under the hedges.

the Kalamazoo River snd a road.
The river, which is about as
wide and fast as the Wear at
Durham, is extensively bordered
by such woods.
  No sign of felling or manage-
ment.
  Canopy rather irregular, No
glades, save at river's edge. Few
fallen trees.

Andropogon scoparius
Sandy hill, probably an old
dune associated with former lake
shore. Firm sandy soil not un-
like the lichen heaths of the
Breckland. Scattered small tus-
socks of Andropogon.
  Red Cladonia is one of the 
chief csrpet-formers: it somewhat
replaces C. foliacae in Europe.
Seen also a Connecticut College.
Known as "British Soldiers" from
its shape and colour.
  Sand area is on high ground
and sharply demarcated from
[21226-21227]
1226
surrounding woods. Possibly the
only dominant of the old prairies.
This area, of a few acres, has
ben planted with red pines but
they have not prospered. (This
planting was in rhe name of con-
servstion!)
The wood occupies the edge
of a plateau, abruptly sloping 
down to a swamp. Plateau
has several hills sand hollows, too
big to be tip-ups.
Oaks. The wood is said to be de-
rived from an "oak opening",
but ;ittle evidence of this remains.
Big trees are all oaks; many are
double-trunks but no evidence
of an underground gru could be
found by parting the litter. No
burr oak seen.

Swamp. S.E. of Kalamazoo.
Pin oaks growiong in pools.
Calameg cf canescara  dom
interior is low brambles
Aronia melanocarpa -abundant
shrub about 3ft high, often dom-
inant.
  Water level very high, most
of the vegetation including the oak
bases is submerged.
  No tamarck.
  Oaks certainly increasing:
they form a closed canopy in
parts of the swamp. All pin oak.
Small spreading tree with many
horizontal branches down to
ground level.
  Numerous Vaccinium spp.
  No Sphagnum seen; but it may
be submerged by high water.

[DIAG]

some oaks near N.E. corner - could
these be remains of oak wilt?
Gap phases very clear; perhaps 
resulting from last felling.
   Fallen logs abundant; they prob-
ably represent unsaleable parts of
felled trees.
----> p. 1226 Martha Mott cont.
   The wood and swamp are a
1229
nature reserve belonging to the
local Audobon Society. The reserve
also includes an old-field
maintained as rough grass.
  Dead trees are few, mainly
oak; could result from former
oak wilt.
  Abundance of poison-ivy sug-
gests partial sec.-woodland
origin.
Juniperus communis. One sapling
cannot be compared with Euro-
pean habit. The only tree sp. so
far encountered common to Europe.
Curved trees. "Ice-storm"
curvature (p. 1220) is general among
the big oaks of the wood.
Not always in the same direction.
Vines. Prominent in gaps (of un-
kniwn origin); said to spread
[21230-21231]
1230
and to overtop & kill trees.
Ruffed Grouse. Remarkable drum-
ming sound; exactly resembles the
"thump-thump-thump" of a dis-
tant diesel engine being put into
gear.
Swamps. Frequently contain tam-
arack in this area. The swamp 
on p. 1227 is typical of those being
invaded by trees; these are
invaded by other swamps in which
the trees are all dead of a
sudden. Martha Mott is probsbly in
the early stage of tree invasion.

The bog occupies the site of a
1233
glacial lake which had a sandy
shoreline. This has given rise to a 
series of hillocks, evidently old dunes,
round the edge, from which sand,
covered by increasing thicknesses of peat,
slopes down into the bog's interior.
(Deepest c. 35 ft)
A. Sand-dunes, much disturbed,
remnants of Andropogon etc grass-
lands and of lichen heath.
B-B. Mosaic of (a) relict Polytrichum

pogon; (b) patches of Robinia
invasion with occasional pin oaks.
Robinia suckers and grows c. 12 ft

ing.
E. Canal with quite fast-flowing

water joining two lakes.
E-F. Main tamarack swamp.
G. Narrow fringe with sparse tam-
arack and much Aronia, a bush
c. 6 ft high, which does not occur
in the wettelst parts.
  Main swamp is a mosaic of
tamarack groves & plains. Groves
consist of a few old, rather low
twisted tamarack and dense to
rather open, unevenaged, stands of
presumably younger trees. The
[21236-21237]
1236
majority of the trees are unusu
ally straight   for tsmarack. Biggest
about 30 ft high, 5" thick. Very
few white pines, which look somwhat
stunted but undoubtedly grow much
faster than the tamarack.
   Beneath the tsmarack is a
variable, sometimes dense, under-
storey of Vaccinium corymbrosum,
with occasional Chamaedaphne Cassandra caly-
                                  culata.
   Glades occupy about half the
area, Treeless (though a few young
tamarack appear to be invading).
Continuous Sphagnum with low
cover of Chamaedaphne,  Sarra-
cenia freq. Andromeda occ.
Vaccinium in patches (but much
commoner under the tasmaracks).
  This bog is undoubtedly in a
1237
phase of increasing tree cover.
No dead trees anywhere. (Other
bogs are full of dead trees and
probably represent the other half of
a cyclical succession.)
  H onward. Dense young tam-
arack and tall Vacciniumm, with
sparse Acer rubrum becoming 
more abundant to right of dia-
gram. Maples appear to be
younger than tamaracks. Sphagnum
continuous.
Levels. F,G,H appear to be
at the same level apart from
very shallow hollows (c. 6" deep,
20 yds across). Pool-&-hummock
structure is very slight and is not
firm. The foot sinks about 9"
below present water-table (which
is raised by recent heavy rain)
[21238-21239]
1238
whether a hummock or hollow is
trodden on. there seem to be at
least 3 spp. of sphagnum with
a rubellin-like sp. at the highest
levels and a cuspidatum-like
sp;. at the lowest, but the dif-
ferences are much less distinct
than in English bogs.
Pitcher-plants. One sp. only
Sarracenia purpurea. The pichers
comprise almost the entire leaf.
Old ones are pot-bellied in shape.
They are about 3/4 full of water. The
inside is very smoothy & shiny.
Above the water the walls and lips
are set with small stiff white down-
wardly directed bristles about 1/2 mm
apart. The bottom of an old
pitcher tapers to a narrow funnel
whose sediment consists largely
12139
of the headpieces of insects.
Minute gray invertebrates swarm
on the pitcher outsides and on
the surface inside.
  According to R. Brewer the pit-
chers act mainly to catch rain-
water and supply the plant with 
nutrients therein.
  Plants are common throughout
the unshaded parts of the bog.
Something has eaten the top part 
off many of the pitchers.
Cypripedium acaule. Large plant
(c. 1 ft high) now in early bud.
Frequent on peat under trees.

Bog is said to be in multiple
ownership and not legally pro-
tected.
*Highest hummocks have tufts
if a small Polytrichum.
[21240-21241]
1240
Burr Oak. Recognizable as
a late-leafing very rugged oak
with spreading habit and
very thick twigs. Appears to be con-
fined to Kalamazoo City, where it
occurs as a relict of the early
19th cent. The most robur-like oak
seen so far.

Curving Habit. Common [DIAG]
in woods in many
tree spp. including
oaks, maples,
ash, black cherry.   Especially
frequent in oaks of Martha Mott.
Eriophorum sp. (one-headed): freq.
in open places in middle of Bishop's
bog.

Kalamazoo to Chicago. 28 min.
DC9
Considerable tracts of heathland
W. of Kalamazoo, not wholly in-
vaded by trees.
L. Michigan comes into view al-
most directly after takeoff.

Mixture of dark & light soil con-
tinues right up to Lake Michigan.
Great clouds of silt discharg-
ing into L. Michigan through
a big river entering by a large
town.
  Between Kalamazoo & the lake
iw mixed arable & grass. Wood-
lots evidently occupy patches of
unsuitable land; their bound-
arie are irrcgular and do not
conform to the regular grid of
[21242-21243]
1242
mile-squares & property boundaries.
Mottlings of soil are irregular
- average mosaic size [SYMBOL] 5 ac.
- but here and there are sinu-
ous strips of dark soil looking
like old watercourses.
  Flight passes far out over 
L. Michigan.

  Then arable land - strongly
patchy and with river channels.
S. of the lake all arable farm-
land. Still patchy soil. Rigid grid
of mile-squares, mostly 4-5 farms
each. Almost no woodland.
Wabash: great braided river in
multiple channels between sand-
bsnks.
  N. of Cincinnti: similar terrsin
but full of dendritically-branched
wooded gullies between the fields.
Mile-squares partly interrupted
by the bigger gulies. Few

1244
fencerows here or in Indiana.
  Cincinnati is a vast and dif-
fuse city, at least 32 miles across.
Wooded hilly terrain with many
branching ravines. Irregular road
system. Patches and strips of pasture
in otherwise wooded hiltops.

Cottontail Rabbit. One seen on road
ner Kalamazoo. Like an Eng-
lish rabbit but lighter-built and
with bigger ears & tail.

Cincinnati to Knoxville. Same
plane.
S. of Cincinn.: England-like
network of thick hedges, woods,
and biggish fields (ara. < past.) in
hilly wooded terrain. Hedges
tend to follow gullies. Strongly
1245
reminiscent of the Weald.
  Great river Ohio - at least
as big as Rhine.
  Some attempt at long E-W
axes - but most roads and hedges
are determined by the terrain.
 Further S. land becomes flatter
with semi-regular grid. Numer-
ous hedges. (This around Lex-
ington). Conspicuous red-brown soil.
   Then cloud.
   Then complex wooded hills with
numerous irregular little basins

ges remarkably regular. Plain is
mainly grass with irregular

very sharp.

[DIAG]

These are the heath balds:
several seen on ridges far above the
Newfound Gap wood, and others
on the Forney Divide on the Carolina
side. Not topographically predictable.
they usual1250ly have a distinct core
of Rhododendron surrounded by 
oaks.

Picea Wildwood. "Picea-Abies".
Prob. unevenaged Picea cover
c. 90%. Glades formed by occasional
uprootings. Many long-standing dead
trees.
Patches of ylw birch & Sorbus in
gaps.
Early gap phase is viburnum alni-
folium
Rich ground vegetalion including
Senecio rugelia. Veratrum
Erythronium     Claytonia
Angelica
Small groups of young firs at
edges of gaps.
Standing dead = c.10% of
living trees. Fallen 15%
[????] much mossed &
lichened.
Mosses largely cover fallen trees.
1251
Biggest trees are ylw birch -
great gnarled trees up to c.
4 ft thick.
Trillium
Little deer browsing - viber-
num forms a near-continuous,
though thin, shrub layer.
  This occupies about 2 miles of 
ridge W. of Mount Buckley. Picea
predominates over Abies in places,
but see p. 1262. Probably does not
extend far down either side;
this is rhe S.W. - most example of
this forest is the Appalachians.
Picea rubens, He-Balsam, is
slightl;y bigger than Abies fraseri
(She-Bslsam) but difficult to dis-
tinguish from it.
  Gap-phases very pronounced, un-
like evenaged forest p. 1247-8.

Mountain Beech Forest
5500 ft. 3 mni. W. of Clingmans
Dome
Beech c. 30 ft high, variable dia.
2" to 1 1/4 ft.
Aesculus octandra about 10%
cover 6" - 1 1/4 ft dia. Rsther
bigger crown than beech of same
size.
Amelancher laevis rare, reaching
canopy.Thin patchy understorey of
beech suckers, usu. 1 - 4 ft high,
said to be encouraged by swine.
Rubus canadensis sparse
thickets up to c. 30 ft across.
Shrub & undershrub cover c. 10%
Herb cdoveer c. 30%.
Carex spp. (indeterminate) loc. dom.
said to be encouraged by swine. 
1253
Claytonia 10% - was complete
cover before swine came -
Erythronium v. ab.
these last two are favourite foods
of swine, which rootle more in
some seasons than in this.
Beech and buckeye trunks al-
most 100% vegetated. 25%
mosses (Frullania, Orthotrichum etc)
30% foliose lichens (inc. a Lobenia).
The rest crustose lichens.
almost all trees 1-stemmed
Very few dead trees.
Thin patchy leaf litter. Buck-
eye lvs disappeared. Very thin
mor-like F layer Grey non-sticky
soil.
Picea & Abies both come to
the edge of the beech area
on the N.-facing slope. This
