1213
  Elm suckers reaching pole size,
then killed by disease, in fen
by road.

  The fen is a swampy stretch
of woodland running S.W. from the
main road. Part of it is open,
partly through grubbing-out
under electricity lines. Fen is
rich in species; an early-fl.
Senecio, now in full flower, is
specially abundant here. Herbs
form a tsll sward about 3 ft
high. Leafing and flowering are
about a month in advance of
English fens.
  East of the fen is a tract
of hollows and pools rather like
the woodland ponds of East Ang-
lia. This area has abundant
[21214-21215]
1214
elm and red maple. Somewhat
peaty in hollows. This area is
a tract along what may have
been once an ill-defined course
of the stream now canalized.
  The wood is otherwise quite
flat.
  Poison ivy is freq. in swampy
area, ab. at edges of wood.
  Edges of wood have no
earthworks. Wood evidently ex-
panded beyond remains of old
sheep-netting fence.
  Probably two ages of stumps.
The ypunger ones are very rotted
and close to big trees; they seem
too old to be due to a small fel-
ling which appears to be recorded
in air photographs in 1960x 7.
Fen dead trees except for
                      ---> p.1228

dom. Some old mostly dead
sugar maple.
Zantoxylon  b. americanum
Much poison ivy
[21216-21217]
1216
  These hedges are typical of
this area; they divide up fields
of about 70 acres, which are
about 2/3 arable. Probably 2-3
fields per farm.
  Roadside hedge is irregular
and gappy; non-roadside hedge,
like most such, is regular and
probably acts as windbreak. No
evidence of planting or direct
management, although several
spp including Zantoxylon wrre 
not seen in woods in Michigsn.
  Probably about 4 sp. in 30
yds for both hedges.
  Irregular banks of stones,
evidently remved from arable,
under the hedges.
1217
Floodplain Forest.
Where Cpomstock-Kalamazoo
town bdy crosses Kalamazoo River.

crumb structure. No litter layer.

Lysimachia nummularia freq. in
semi-organic soil.
1219
Acer saccharinum, silver maple,
is abundant as a biggish tree.
  This wood forms sa strip 
about 100 yards wide between
the Kalamazoo River snd a road.
The river, which is about as
wide and fast as the Wear at
Durham, is extensively bordered
by such woods.
  No sign of felling or manage-
ment.
  Canopy rather irregular, No
glades, save at river's edge. Few
fallen trees.
  Herbs and undershrubs gener-
ally present, rather luxuriant;
possible phosphate plants.
