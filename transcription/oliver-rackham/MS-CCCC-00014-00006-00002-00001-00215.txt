Hardwick Wood Lane.
Trifolium fragiferum@ freq.
at E. end
T. ochroleucon: ab in several
places in the lane S.E. of Wood
Fen. Flowers contain copious

Lane hedge survives in S. and
S.W. side. Hawthorn of no
particular interest.

about 300 yards of lane from
the stream nearly up to Wood

of the lane.
Hordeum secalinum: ab.
in several places E. of Wood
Fm. In rather open places
with moderate wear.

The Portway from Highfields
to Coton passes chiefly through
arable and thorn hedges, of 
no particular interest.
The Lathymus aphaca site at
the E. end of Short's Factory,
by the Coton footpath, has
a cereal crop. Only a few
Lathymus plants survive.
The sparrows are continuing
to nest in the hollow finial of
the street-lamp outside my
rooms at Selwyn Gardens.

HAYLEY WOOD.
Stukeley Mere.
Island was made today by joining
together about 1/2 ton of maple
& aspen logs from Hayley Wood
with wire & staples. Held
down by buried cross wires
and by willow stakes at
intervals. Bush of Sx
cinerea fetched from S. side
of lake where it had stranded,
and replaced.
On the S. side of the lake
are several willow bushes
which have grown up probably
on the smaller islands, become
detached in storms, floated
across, and taken root.
Three Little Ringed Plovers
seen. They make a noise 
like a pedestrian crossing.
[16758-16759]
Deepest part of the main
lake seems to be about
5ft - water level now being 
about 1 1/2 ft below usual.
Bottom very uneven, rising
to within a few inches in
places. Gravel with coarse
sand and much clay. Charo-
phytes continuous in places;
some narrow-leaved Potamo-
geton but otherwise little
higher plant vegetation.
Salix alba cut for
stakes: c. 3" across at 5y.
growth (prob. from stool
shoots in few years after
original establishment). About
20ft high.
Navigated in rubber dinghy - very
unmanageable in slight wind.
July 21.
Hardwick Wood Lane (Natur-
alists Trust)/
Lactuca vinosa. Four plants
near Wood Farm, the tallest
7ft high. Leaves not comp[????]s
arrangement.
Elecampane. About 100 yeards
beyond Wood Fm, in S. verge,
no habitation evidence near
8 flowering stems coming into
flower.
Odontites. Frequent
Elecampane leaves have
a faint atomatic taste.

Old senescent Vib opal. by
stream.
Equisetum fluviatile - stmomata
visible with naked eye.
Pingoes not all explored: some 
to the S. are in woodland.
They are perfectly circular and 
remarkably steep-sided. The ridges
are mostly chalk grassland, with
small patches of chalk heath.
The hollows are mostly calcareous
but very diverse, with extensive
Sphagnum in places.
Conjunction of chalk-heath and
fen appears to be unique.
Carex muricata agg.: big tus-
sock in calcareous grassland near
E. entrance. [C. spicata]

Grazed by cattle and rabbits.
Dry turf is very short and in ex-
cellent condition.
Scattered oaks, ashes, &c.
Sallows frequent in some pingoes.
More generally bushed-over and
birch-grown to the S. The owner
is sympathetic and maintains 
just the right amount of grazing,
but is opposed to scheduling the
site.
Said to be no surviving common
rights.

Fowlmere is much larger
and more gently-sloping than
Ringmere or the Punch-bowl.
The vegetation zones are different
and less sharply defined.
Ringmere.
Quite dry. The zones are al-
most identical to those of the
Punchbowl.
No sign whatever of the nettles
and thistles reported by W.G. Clarke
to have grown in the bottom during
earlier drying-out periods.

Scirpius zone.
A remarkable regular structure
consisting of a central depression
surrounded by two exactly
circular ditches, Excavated incon-
clusively in the 1930s on the basis
that it is a prehistoric artefact;
but it appears to be adapted
from a natural feature.
Water-table evidently fluc-
tuates in the same way as in 
Ringmere. Similar, though very com-
pressed vegetation zones.
