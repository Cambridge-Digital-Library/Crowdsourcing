Lane hedge survives in S. and
S.W. side. Hawthorn of no

Lathymus aphaca: ab. in
about 300 yards of lane from
the stream nearly up to Wood

of the lane.
Hordeum secalinum: ab.

The Portway from Highfields
to Coton passes chiefly through
arable and thorn hedges, of 
no particular interest.
The Lathymus aphaca site at
the E. end of Short's Factory,
by the Coton footpath, has
a cereal crop. Only a few
Lathymus plants survive.
The sparrows are continuing
to nest in the hollow finial of
the street-lamp outside my

HAYLEY WOOD.
Stukeley Mere.
Island was made today by joining
together about 1/2 ton of maple
& aspen logs from Hayley Wood
with wire & staples. Held
down by buried cross wires
and by willow stakes at
intervals. Bush of Sx
cinerea fetched from S. side
of lake where it had stranded,
and replaced.
On the S. side of the lake
are several willow bushes
which have grown up probably
on the smaller islands, become
detached in storms, floated
across, and taken root.
Three Little Ringed Plovers
seen. They make a noise 
like a pedestrian crossing.
[16758-16759]
Deepest part of the main
lake seems to be about
5ft - water level now being 
about 1 1/2 ft below usual.
Bottom very uneven, rising
to within a few inches in
places. Gravel with coarse
sand and much clay. Charo-
phytes continuous in places;
some narrow-leaved Potamo-
geton but otherwise little
higher plant vegetation.
Salix alba cut for
stakes: c. 3" across at 5y.
growth (prob. from stool
shoots in few years after
original establishment). About
20ft high.
Navigated in rubber dinghy - very
unmanageable in slight wind.

Hardwick Wood Lane (Natur-
alists Trust)/
Lactuca vinosa. Four plants
near Wood Farm, the tallest
7ft high. Leaves not comp[????]s
arrangement.
Elecampane. About 100 yeards
beyond Wood Fm, in S. verge,
no habitation evidence near
8 flowering stems coming into

Odontites. Frequent
Elecampane leaves have
a faint atomatic taste.

small patches of chalk heath.

is sympathetic and maintains

Ringmere.
Quite dry. The zones are al-
most identical to those of the

No sign whatever of the nettles
and thistles reported by W.G. Clarke

Scirpus zone.
A remarkable regular structure
consisting of a central depression
surrounded by two exactly
circular ditches, Excavated incon-
clusively in the 1930s on the basis
that it is a prehistoric artefact;
but it appears to be adapted
from a natural feature.
Water-table evidently fluc-
tuates in the same way as in 
Ringmere. Similar, though very com-
pressed vegetation zones.
Effect of drying-up on Scirpus.
Scirpus lacustris grows
c. 5ft abve the bottomn of
the Punch-bowl, and in correspon-
ding places at Fowlmere and
MMM. Varies enormously in
vihgour with level of water.
[!!!!]Last year's{!!!!] Old ste,s from
the year before last at the
Punchbowl are 13mm diam;
this year's 2mm dia. and
c. 2ft high, sterile. Similar
but slightly smaller diferences
at the other sites.
Acorus forms an abun-
dant fringe to the roadside
pool near Ringmere. Leaves
have strong scent of orange.
Flowering.
[16776-16777]
This pool is said to be
13ft deep. Water level is only
a few in. below normal, and
is several feet higher
than in Ringmere, Langmere, or
the moated moated mere.
Birches in Pingoes, E.Walton.
Grows on or near the
Schwingmoor areas, rooted in
Menyanthes-Carex mat. Dis-
tinct from normal Betula
pubescens in and around the
same places.
Tree to c.8ft high. Leaves
very neatly ovate with truncate
base, as in continental B.
odorata. Twigs less hairy
than in normal pubescens.
Leaves thick, rather chlorotic,
as in odorata. Slight aro-
matic scent.

About half the bushes in
the silvery Euonymous hedge on

On the S. side of this enclosure

Fenmere is in a patch of

In the pingo area most
of the barley is severely droughted,
the chief exceptions being in
the bottoms of hollows. Complex
pattern of areas with different
types of second growth. Some
areas have strong Second
growth tillers with well-filled
ears beginning to senesce and
capable of producing a near-
normal crop. Grains in well-
developed 2nd-growth ears 
are rather few but large

not a pollard, though the trunk
