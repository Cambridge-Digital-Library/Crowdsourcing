Elms G are remarkably tall and
very conspicuous; see Plate 129 in
RHCM. They are in line with the
E. side of the great avenue.  They
stand on a ridge which probsbly
marks either the S.W. side of "Bayley
mead" (1638) or its prolongation
between "Mayds close" & "Balls dynes".

  Village elms H and I are related
to the road which formed the
main N-S axis of the village;
they were either alongside the road
itself or in boundsries of
closes to either side.
 J appears to be the pollard
form of this elm. It is, howecer,
pollarded c. 12ft up, so may be
a self-pollard. It probably re-
presents the back end of Thresham 
Close or Parsonage Close.
 Elms G are slightly affected
by DED. H are stumps only.
I is unaffected. J has been
15
[DIAG]
slightly affected for several years,
but is resisting the spread of
the disease.
   These elms are remark-
able for longevity and slow
[20014-20015]
16
growth.  They closely resemble
the [!!!!] "[SYMBOL]-Boxworth" elms
of the Avenue, but differ in
their much greater apical dom-
inance. Together with elm E
and with Boxworth, they form a
related group of elms similar
on leaf characters but not in 
habit. [!!!!] These elms are very
resistant to DED.

  K is a rectangular pond in
an enclosure, surrounded by
elms and other trees.  It seems
to be a post-emparkment in-
trusion, like Lady's Pond L.

  According to the present 
(?1902) O.S., there were many
more trees in the neighbourhood of
17
G than survived into the 1960s.
I and J and the many youn-
ger tree around then are unac-
countably omitted from the O.S.
  There may be some more
village elms to be found in
this area. The associated
earthworks, mapped by the
RCHM, were only dimly distin-
guishable in the conditions of
today.

  M: two elms and the stump
of a third quite typical [SYMBOL]-Box-
worth, about 3-4ft dia. Slightly
affected with DED, which is not
progressing fast. These almost
certainly mark the W. side of
the N-S village street.

Boxworth-type
 Trunk very crooked, with
sideways tendency at top.
 Branches crooked, wideangled,
forming rounded head.
 Bark strongly retic, many
burrs
 Epicora many, mainly on burrs.
Twigs thin, not pendulous
or divar.
19
E: two elms side by side,
probably survivors of a row
running NNW-SSE along the
public road. Closely resembles
"[SYMBOL]-Boxworth" but has straight
upright trunk and rather regular
horizontal shortish branches. The
branching distinguishes it from
the "village" clone.

N: this maple, one of the biggest
in Cambs, seems not to correspond
to any pre-emparking boundary.
In this arboretum-like area are
several very big maples.

O: big Tilia cordata, very chlorotic.

P: double-walled kitchen-garden
with many glasshouses etc. Thehe ha-ha is a symmetricsl\ditch some 5 ft deep with an

[DIAG]

[20020-20021]
22
surrounding grove consists largely
of elms of at least 5 different
genotypes, but with much ash
and other trees.  The W. side has
been much unbderplanted with
Prunus lusitanica.
  The commonest elm in the 
grove is a suckering cxg hybrid,
not "Dutch Elm"; this may be
of several clones. About 60%
dead of DED, but some patches
have wholly escaped.
  The small area attributed
to Up is all dead, but for
suckers c.8ft high. The elms were
apparently the same as in the S.
Avenue.
The Uc elm is unaffected.
The [SYMBOL]Boxworth and Village
elms cannot be differentiated
23
with certainty in woodland.
They are alive and only slightly
singed by DED. This is curious
and paradoxical: the elms
in the interior of the wood have
been [!!!![ much more recently
attacked than these at the
margin. Edge of wood was a field
boundary in 1638.
P: middlesized Tilia platyphyllos
by garden.
Q: earthworks clearly visible in
this field.
R: this group of elms is asso-
ciated with the 1638 village street.
Two of them are clearly Boxworth-
-type, with rugged trunks breaking
into a head of branches, both 
show a tendency for the trunk
to turn sideways near its top.
[20022-20023]
24
The other elms of group R
are "village" type, similar in
shape (but not quite so high
nor so thick) to the village
elms G-J.

S: the ha-ha is a symmetrical
ditch some 5ft deep with an
overgrown but definite hedge (of
thorn, maple, elm mixed) at the
bottom. Also at the bottom are
the very decayed remains of a
post-rail-pale fence.  [DIAG)
Only the tops of
the posts, and a few rails sur-
vive. Of oak and probably de-
cayed 100 years.

T: large depression locally called
a chalk-pit. (Already there in early
18th cent, RCHM Pl. 1216)
25
U: the hedge becomes a row of
big cg elms, similar to the com-
monest elm around P. Uneven-
aged, up to c. 2 1/2ft dia. Strongly
suckering. about 90% dead.

V: change to a slightly differ-
ent clone, ab. Ucg, also 90%
dead.

W: single tree c. 4ft dia. of the
U-type elm, disease severe.

X: in boundary belt, an elm un-
like any seen hitherto in Wimpole.

zontal branches, leaves even

AD: West Avenue 6 elms are
the only survivors. 5 are certainly
[SYMBOL]-Boxworth and are identical
to those in the S. Avenue. These
are slightly or not affected by
DED. One, moderstely affected,
larger, broader leaves, seems
to be another segregate from
the same group of elms. There
are many stumps; suckers
grazed but seem to be Uc, not
Up. All about 3-4 ft dia., ear-
liest ring c. 1710. No replanting
has been done.

AE: formal garden clearly vis-
ible in this area as humps &
