Hippophae is abundant on
steep S.facing slopes between
Pian[????] and Landeck, but not
above 900 m.
Ulmus glabra is abundant
in the Landeck basin, and as
far W. as the Trisanna Bridge,
usually as a small tree but 
often to c 50 ft high. No DED
seen.
Pine forests similar to the 
Zammerloch type extend along
the S.facing slopes of Sta[????]ertal
as far W. as Schnann or beyond.
Farmhouses in St Anton
are of the Unterland type: broad,
large, with the Stall behind the 
house on the same building.
Beech forests clothe the lower
[17038-17039]
S. facing slopes of Klostertal
as far as Langen: none seen
in Sta[????]ertal. Usually mixed
with spruce: sycamore occasional
around 1100m. Abies not seen 
above Br[????], local below.
Beech usually closed, varying 
in height, mainly evenaged,
no trace of underwood or of
coppice origin.
The A[????]wald at the junction
of the Lutz and Ill is dominated
by spruce, mainly unevenaged
and mosaic, with many other
spp including a lot of ash.
Oak extends up as far 
as Br[???? but is not common.
The main-road bridge between
Feldkirch and Maria-grün is
a fine single-span timber-framed
bridge with roof. Box type with
multiple diagonal bracing/ Numer-
ous minor-road wooden bridges
survive in Klostertal and Sta[????]er-
tal.
Elms
Aarau: U. glabra freq. as non
woodland tree. Disease not certain.
Elms rare at Olten.
Murgenthal: elms, app. U. [????]pin,
frequent along the Aar. No dis-
ease seen: prob. some drought.
Bern: elms freq. incl. a few
Wheatley. Old dieback: no specific
symptoms.
[17040-17041]
Many woods between Zürich
and Bern. Dominated normally by
beech, less often by spruce. Oak
& ash common but never dominant.
No elms seen. Always high-forest:
mosaic of evenaged stands is the 
commonest structure. No trace 
of coppice seen. Proportion of
spruce is increasing. O[????]. small
pockets of pine, but no larch
or Abies seen. Wood boundaries
often irregular: normally no earth
work.
Country between Zürich
and Bern, especially in the SW
half is strongly champaign, with 
big villages, open fields on the 
Tirolese pattern, and hardly any
hedges.

Nothing seen of Livermore Park ex-
cept trees along lake.

Extensive flooding of grassland

Standing water in fields on the

Much water stands in fields 
in High Suffolk.
The lane N. of Offton Mid-
dle Wood, just W. of its junction
with Offton main street, forms
a grundle about 20ft deep.
A stream runs along the road
for some 200 yards; normally 
it appears to lie at the side 
of the road, but today the whole
bottom was flooded.
There is a gull some 15
ft deep. called The Channel on
the map, beside the main
[17064-17065]
street of Offton S. of Middle 
Wood.
Offton Middle Wood was ap-
proached from the N. from Rings-
[DIAG]
hall Stocks. Thgis involves a very 
sharp turn near Offton Church.
Before the turn the road takes
to the bed of the Offton Channel/
The stream in the channel was 
swollen to cover the whole width
of the road: there was a powerful
run-off from the small area of
farmland which it drains.
OFFTON MIDDLE WOOD
Spindle is abundant and
fruiting remarkably well in this
wood: [SYMBOL].
Heavy guns in the distance 
were herd from Offton Middle
Wood. It is 19 1/2 miles to the 
nearest ranges, at Langenhoe.

cards.
CHURCH WOOD TREMNT PARK. cards only.
Enfield Chace.
Monken Hadley Common is a 
surviving part of the Chase. Topogra-
phy like Epping Forest, with gravel-
ly hills and clayey bottoms.
General sequence similar to 
Epping, with catena beech-oak
-horbeam-ash-elm. Boundaries
are rather less sharp and horn-
beam much less abundant.
No pollarding; few ancient
trees. Although most of the trees
are less than 250 years old the
surviving fragment is very repre-
sentative of the 1701 description 
of the Chace.
No grazing for many years.
Not much damage by visitors.
Patches of locally high ferti-
lity, reflected both in trees and
ground vegetation.
Elm disease is severe in
the boundaries and among 
elms outside (which are mainly
procera), but has little effect so
far on the main glabra elms
in the interior.
At 252973 there is a giant
elm, probably an old pollard some
10ft dia. [SYMBOL]13.
Splendid displays of fungi &
myxomycetes on fallen beech logs in
the Chace. Co[????]ne 17" dia ([SYMBOL]14).

Trent Park.
A Country Park. Much secon-
dary woodland, both planted and
natural. Unlikely that anything
remains from the Chace.
The hornbeam in Oak Wood
must have been planted in the
19th cent. Much birch invasion in
Rough Lot and around Ferny Hill
Farm. Not obvious why there should
be a moat.
The land is evidently very bad
farmland and much of what remains
is tumbling down to woodland.
Dec.7.
17 hollows in the Larling-
ford pingo-field have water or
mud in them - including several 
which are plowed.
4 hollows in front of the farm 
between Snetterton race-track
and Harling Fen have water -
this includes one which seems to
have been made into a pond.
Stallode Wash: the remain-
ing half is covered with water.
On Gallows Hill, Thetford,
are two strips each of c. 2ac.
of artichokes, planted each
to the W. side of a pine hedge.
Artichokes very patchy and 
mixed with Dactylis &c.
