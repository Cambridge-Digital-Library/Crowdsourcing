Hippophae is abundant on
steep S.facing slopes between
Pian[????] and Landeck, but not
above 900 m.
Ulmus glabra is abundant
in the Landeck basin, and as
far W. as the Trisanna Bridge,
usually as a small tree but 
often to c 50 ft high. No DED
seen.
Pine forests similar to the 
Zammerloch type extend along
the S.facing slopes of Sta[????]ertal
as far W. as Schnann or beyond.
Farmhouses in St Anton
are of the Unterland type: broad,
large, with the Stall behind the 
house on the same building.
Beech forests clothe the lower
[17038-17039]
S. facing slopes of Klostertal
as far as Langen: none seen
in Sta[????]ertal. Usually mixed
with spruce: sycamore occasional
around 1100m. Abies not seen 
above Br[????], local below.
Beech usually closed, varying 
in height, mainly evenaged,
no trace of underwood or of
coppice origin.
The A[????]wald at the junction
of the Lutz and Ill is dominated
by spruce, mainly unevenaged
and mosaic, with many other
spp including a lot of ash.
Oak extends up as far 
as Br[???? but is not common.
The main-road bridge between
Feldkirch and Maria-grün is
a fine single-span timber-framed
bridge with roof. Box type with
multiple diagonal bracing/ Numer-
ous minor-road wooden bridges
survive in Klostertal and Sta[????]er-
tal.
Elms
Aarau: U. glabra freq. as non
woodland tree. Disease not certain.
Elms rare at Olten.
Murgenthal: elms, app. U. [????]pin,
frequent along the Aar. No dis-
ease seen: prob. some drought.
Bern: elms freq. incl. a few
Wheatley. Old dieback: no specific
symptoms.
[17040-17041]
Many woods between Zürich
and Bern. Dominated normally by
beech, less often by spruce. Oak
& ash common but never dominant.
No elms seen. Always high-forest:
mosaic of evenaged stands is the 
commonest structure. No trace 
of coppice seen. Proportion of
spruce is increasing. O[????]. small
pockets of pine, but no larch
or Abies seen. Wood boundaries
often irregular: normally no earth
work.
Country between Zürich
and Bern, especially in the SW
half is strongly champaign, with 
big villages, open fields on the 
Tirolese pattern, and hardly any
hedges.

Much water stands in fields

The lane N. of Offton Mid-

a grundle about 20ft deep.
A stream runs along the road
for some 200 yards; normally 
it appears to lie at the side 
of the road, but today the whole
bottom was flooded.
There is a gull some 15
ft deep. called The Channel on

street of Offton S. of Middle 
Wood.
Offton Middle Wood was ap-

hall Stocks. Thgis involves a very 
sharp turn near Offton Church.
Before the turn the road takes
to the bed of the Offton Channel/
The stream in the channel was 
swollen to cover the whole width
of the road: there was a powerful
run-off from the small area of
farmland which it drains.

CHURCH WOOD TREMNT PARK. cards only.
Enfield Chace.
Monken Hadley Common is a 
surviving part of the Chase. Topogra-
phy like Epping Forest, with gravel-
ly hills and clayey bottoms.
General sequence similar to 
Epping, with catena beech-oak
-horbeam-ash-elm. Boundaries
are rather less sharp and horn-
beam much less abundant.
No pollarding; few ancient
trees. Although most of the trees
are less than 250 years old the
surviving fragment is very repre-
sentative of the 1701 description 
of the Chace.
No grazing for many years.
Not much damage by visitors.
Patches of locally high ferti-
lity, reflected both in trees and
ground vegetation.
Elm disease is severe in
the boundaries and among 
elms outside (which are mainly
procera), but has little effect so
far on the main glabra elms
in the interior.
At 252973 there is a giant
elm, probably an old pollard some
10ft dia. [SYMBOL]13.

Trent Park.
A Country Park. Much secon-
dary woodland, both planted and
natural. Unlikely that anything
remains from the Chace.
The hornbeam in Oak Wood
must have been planted in the
19th cent. Much birch invasion in
Rough Lot and around Ferny Hill
Farm. Not obvious why there should
be a moat.
The land is evidently very bad
farmland and much of what remains
is tumbling down to woodland.
Dec.7.
17 hollows in the Larling-
ford pingo-field have water or

which are plowed.
4 hollows in front of the farm 
between Snetterton race-track

this includes one which seems to
have been made into a pond.
Stallode Wash: the remain-
ing half is covered with water.
On Gallows Hill, Thetford,
are two strips each of c. 2ac.

The Ouse Washes are
completely flooded at the rail-
way bridge, save for a few 
patches on the Ely side.
Between Birmingham and
Kidderminster the elms are
mainly procera and about 2/3 
dead. Glabra freq., carpinif. rare.
Hagley Wood and other woods
round Hagley Park are mostly
coniferized. Hagley W. had
probably been coniferized once
before
Cookley-Wolverley valley.
Flat-bottomed valley with
incised meanders. Sides steep,
>30° in places, with some rock
outcrops. New Red Sandstone,
uniform pink soft sandstone.
[17074-17075]
[DIAG]
The Worcs & Staffs, an early 
canal, follows the contours above the 
river. Usually formed by an em-
bankment against the slope but in
several places rock-hewn. Said
to be v-sectioned and only about
4ft deep because of silting, but
still much used and the lock gates
renewed about 10 years ago.
A: Warrens' friend's house, one
of a small terrace, now ostensibly
later than the canal, but prob. on
and earlier site. The
[DIAG]
house and its garden are below 
the canal level; the canal makes
[17076-17077]
a detour away from the valley
side to go round them. The drain-
age from the house and garden
is said to be carried by the brick
tunnels into the ca[????] below the
canal.
B: aqueduct where the Elan
Valley water crosses the canal in
a great arch of three massive
pipes. S. of here is a row of 
chestnut stools along the canal.
C: 4
[DIAG]
pollard oaks on scarp slope
above the canal; although steep
(c. 30°) the scarp must be natural.
One stump had c. 180 rings in
a small fraction of the radius.
Trees must be c. 300-400 y old.
About 5ft dia.
D: deeply incised bend with ver-
tical cliffs to the canal. The com-
mon is rough grass with some
bracken.
E: two [SYMBOL] oaks, one c. 4ft dia.
and last cut c. 170 y. ago.
F: slope of about 45°, truncated 
by cliff to canal. On slope are 
several ancient oaks, not all [SYMBOL].
Some have annual rings of c 1 mm.
One had the top and one side of
the trunk dead; the dead timber
has lost all the sapwood, is
deeply weathered and rotted thro'
at the base. This event must 
have occurred .c 150-200 y. ago.
[17078-17079]
to judge by the weathering.
G: rock-cut lock. The
cliff beside it contains an 
artificial cave, c. 30x15x9ft,
with a bench

walls. [DIAG]
H: meadow used as pasture.
Pollard willows, few fine wych
elms.
I: steep-slope wood, much elm

J: derelict meadow slowly
invaded by sallow.
K: over-mature c[????], see
card.
L: turning basin.
M: rock cutting both sides of
canal.
N: ridge-X-furrow looking
like old water-meadow. Derelict
lock-gate with massive original
iron fittings.
O: BLACK POPLAR. [DIAG]
About 40ft
high (has lost)
its top), 3ft

ches. Identity certain.
P: steep wood (cliff in places)

Huge old pollard oak dead some
years.
Lea Castle.
Now demolished; grounds
used as riding school. Long
brick wall along roadside;
frequent tie-rods against the

Marginal belt is mainly
beech with some hornbeam.
Much birch of c. 30 y. growth.
Box. No evidence of ancient

An elm bowl of the War-
rens has an annual ring with
"slight" DED in two places. The
ring is 47y. back from the [!!!!]outside
of the [!!!!] last ring represented.
The Warrens got the bowl on
their marriage in 1966; the last
ring represented must therefore be 
earlier than 1964, which makes
the disease earlier than 1918. If
any sapwood has been rejected, which
it probably has, this makes the 
bowl several years earlier still.
Dec. 18. [SYMBOL]
Much beet lifting goes on
in Bradfield & Lavenham, in-
cluding Mrs Gooding's field
S of Felsham Hall Wood.
The Kentwell Avenue limes
may be of two different geno-
types; the commoner has ridged 
bark, arching habit, relatively few
epicormics, while the other has 
smoother bark, trunk rather fluted,
more epicormics & suckers. The
latter is less distinct from T.
vulgaris. Both appear to be original.
Both ae pollarded - ? result of 
original management as a 
pleached avenue. No limes have
fallen for at least a year;
one of thsoe that fell earlier has
144 +/- 15 rings in one of the [SYMBOL]
stems. There are c.235 places 
for trees; there are c.12 gaps 
of which 3 are occupied by 
[17084-17085]
T. vulgaris, and about half 
the remainder have vigorous 
suck growth from a stump
which ought now to be singled.
Several other trees have dead
and rotten [SYMBOL] branches. Mistletoe
very common throughout. Trees
particulsrly of the second kind 
sometimes have a rather vulgaris
like angular habit.
Polypody grows in abundance
on an old flint wall near Kent-
well lodge gates: on the NW
side of the wall, well shaded by
limes.
