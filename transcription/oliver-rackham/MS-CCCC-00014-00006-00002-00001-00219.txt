Hippophae is abundant on
steep S.facing slopes between
Pian[????] and Landeck, but not
above 900 m.
Ulmus glabra is abundant
in the Landeck basin, and as
far W. as the Trisanna Bridge,

as far as Langen: none seen
in Sta[????]ertal. Usually mixed
with spruce: sycamore occasional
around 1100m. Abies not seen 
above Br[????], local below.
Beech usually closed, varying 
in height, mainly evenaged,
no trace of underwood or of
coppice origin.
The A[????]wald at the junction
of the Lutz and Ill is dominated
by spruce, mainly unevenaged
and mosaic, with many other
spp including a lot of ash.
Oak extends up as far 
as Br[???? but is not common.
The main-road bridge between

a fine single-span timber-framed
bridge with roof. Box type with

spruce is increasing. O[????]. small
pockets of pine, but no larch
or Abies seen. Wood boundaries
often irregular: normally no earth
