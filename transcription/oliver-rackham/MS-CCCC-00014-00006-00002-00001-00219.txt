Hippophae is abundant on
steep S.facing slopes between
Pian[????] and Landeck, but not
above 900 m.
Ulmus glabra is abundant
in the Landeck basin, and as
far W. as the Trisanna Bridge,
usually as a small tree but 
often to c 50 ft high. No DED

Pine forests similar to the 
Zammerloch type extend along
the S.facing slopes of Sta[????]ertal
as far W. as Schnann or beyond.
Farmhouses in St Anton
are of the Unterland type: broad,
large, with the Stall behind the 
house on the same building.
Beech forests clothe the lower
[17038-17039]
S. facing slopes of Klostertal
as far as Langen: none seen
in Sta[????]ertal. Usually mixed
with spruce: sycamore occasional
around 1100m. Abies not seen 
above Br[????], local below.
Beech usually closed, varying 
in height, mainly evenaged,
no trace of underwood or of
coppice origin.
The A[????]wald at the junction
of the Lutz and Ill is dominated
by spruce, mainly unevenaged
and mosaic, with many other
spp including a lot of ash.
Oak extends up as far 
as Br[???? but is not common.
The main-road bridge between
Feldkirch and Maria-grün is
a fine single-span timber-framed
bridge with roof. Box type with
multiple diagonal bracing/ Numer-
ous minor-road wooden bridges
survive in Klostertal and Sta[????]er-
tal.

Many woods between Zürich
and Bern. Dominated normally by
beech, less often by spruce. Oak
& ash common but never dominant.

spruce is increasing. O[????]. small
pockets of pine, but no larch
or Abies seen. Wood boundaries
often irregular: normally no earth
