Gale damage as severe in 
Brent Eleigh as in Walding-
[17610-17611]
field or Cambridge. Numerous
elms & limes in groves on the
steep gravel sides of the valley
have been uprooted.
There were originally 9 limes
in Lavenham chuchyard: one
disappeared at an early stage.
The growth of their bases has
forced the churchyard wall
into 8 bulges sustained by
buttresses. Some of these but-
tresses are of early-19th-cent,
brickwork at latest.   [SYMBOL].
1 April.
BUFF WOOD.
MADINGLEY WOOD.
No sign of any action about
the Wimpole elms.
Trifolium [!!!!]suffocatum[!!!!]subterraneum. shown
me by D.E. Coombe at Gamlingay.
The site, 235520, is where
a lane forming a slight
holloway has been bulldozed
back on the inside of a
left-hand bend, creating a
steep bank with a level
verge some 20ft wide below
it. All this is in soft sandy
soil. Judging by the new
hedge planted at the top of
the bank, the work was done
[17612-17613]
4 years ago.
The verge is largely unvege-
tated compact sand. Trifolium
subterraneum occurs as patches 
up to about 1ft across, each
consisting of a few hundred
tiny plants of a deep purple
colour. Several other possibly
interesting spp, including ?T.
striatum, also occur.
S.E. of the lane is a fallow
field which had a crop of
beans grown on bamboos. One
big plant of T. subterraneum,
about a foot across, with leaves
having a uniquely complex ar-
rangement of light & dark
markings.
Several big oaks standing
in this field.
[!!!!]Arabis turrita[!!!!] Turritis glabra occurred
until recently on the opposite
bank of the lane. Now lost
by the building of a house &
garden above the bank & con-
sequent eutrophication.
Gnaphalium sylvaticum. Also
refound by D.E. Coombe at
Gamlingay after a lapse of
40 years. On Heath Road,
231519.
Site is very similar - a
cutback (in this case c. 10years
old) on the inside of a 
(very slight) bend of a
shallow holloway. Ground
rather more vegetated, with
[17614-17615]
small broom bushe, but kept
mown.
Gn. sylvaticum occurs as
about 100 plants, flowering
vigorously, halfway up the bank.
Gn. uliginosum occurs on
the verge below - a slightly
wetter habitat (Q.:Ampthill
Clay?)
Park Plantations. Mainly birch
wood (?ex-plantation).
Waresley Park. Ancient oaks
& chestnuts few, decrepit, mostly
in S.E. of park.

around the edges of the
woods and the heath at
Tiger Hill, and around
[17618-17619]
[!!!!]Kedge's[!!!!] Wright's Plantation.
There is a great deal of

[17632-17633]
Another elm in the N.W.
corner of the churchyard, recently
felled, 103y. at about 3ft dia.
Apparently procera x carpin.
The fallen pendulous elm
had a cavity some 4ft dia. in
the base of the trunk, extending
about  6ft up. This was lined
with black zone-plates. Rots of
various kinds, chiefly yellowish
homogeneous (? Polyp. squamosus)
and brown homogeneous (gano-
derma, of which a sporophore
with 2 1/2 layers of tubes was
found inside the cavity). No
evidence of Fomes ulmarius.
Trimming churchyard hedge
to free hedgerow trees, tying back
dog-rose fallen into churchyard,
planting potatoes. Good Friday.
17 April.
Turning compost-heap
measuring 9ft x 5ft x 6ft high
and making two smaller heaps
including other material.
A nest of rats consisting of 
the mother and 11 young was 
found in a heap of recent
compost. Young rats slightly 
smaller than a mouse, with
fully-formed fur, but eyes
not open. When disturbed they
were silent and slow-moving,
seeking the shade.
Large numbers of a big
red-spider about 4mm long
inhabit the partly-rotted grass
of the old heap. 8 short
legs. Bright pinkish scarlet.
Flat-bodied. Same as seen
[17634-17635]
recently in Chalkeney Wood.
Small pockets of the heap
were warm.
The old heap was shaken
apart, interlayered with newer
material, and the layers
watered and liberally sprinkled
with powdered chalk and ac-
clerator.
No woms found in the
heap. Agrostis stolonifera and
bamboos are particularly tenacious
of life.
The rooks in the churchyard
are more numerous than ever
this year. They dislike being
walked beneath and fly
noisily off the nest. The twigs
of the three elms dead of DED
have almost entirely disap-
peared, largely twisted off by
the rooks for nest-material.
A cabbage-heart brought
into the house and taken 
to pieces leaf by leaf sud-
denly sprouted as the last
leaves were removed and
elongated to about 7" long.
Potatoes just appearing -
from earlier planting.
18 April.

Primroses, cowslips, oxlips, and
PO hybrids all in flower in

WEELEY HALL WOOD.
Trees and other plants
[17636-17637]
appreciably more forward in the
Tendring Peninsula than at 
Cambridge.
Little Bentley Hall Wood -
many acres of n/w appear to
have been cut, including the
whole of the W. handle.
Some small pollards of possible
Tilia cordata by Weeley church.
Well-developed Typha in a 
pond by Weeley church.
Weeley Heath is wholly ag-
ricultural land, mainly per-
manent pasture.
Tilia cordata. Three very large
spreading trees, maidens, at 
intervals along roadside, 970-
294. Almost certainly planted.
There is a group of about
15 closely-spaced
elms of very pendulous habit
at the roadside near Josselyns
in Lit Horkesley, 963324. Some
90ft high, 3ft dia., twigs nearly
touching ground. Two recently
blown down. Apparently the
same as those opposite Great
Waldingfield church.
Elm Disease. None seen in
Tendring Peninsula, and little
N. of Colchester.
Some massive fragments of
thin-brickwork, presumably brought
from Weeley Hall, lie by the road-
side in front of Weeley church/

HOE WOOD.
23 April. HOVE
South Malling Hill, by Lewes,
is a detached island part of the
South Downs with remarkably 
steep slopes and much chalk
grassland.
The road from Lewes to Tun-
bridge Wells crosses the Weald mainly
as a ridegway. Very numerous
small woods and sh[????]s, which
almost always line valleys so that
their composition cannot be seen
from the road. Most of the large
woods are coniferized,
The High Weald villages - May-
field, Rotherfield, Mark Cross, Crow-
boro' - are on hilltop sites.
Ashdown Forest.
Large areas of heather, bracken,
and furze. Some encroachment
by birch and oak, mainly in 
the valleys and around old ex-
claves on the plateau. Many
clumps of Scots Pine, now past
[17642-17643]
their prime, giving rise to limited
colonization.
Some grazing goes on at
other times of the year.
About a third of the heathland
has been burnt this year - much
more than usual.
An area intended for a Univ.
Sussex excursion was visited 
and found to have been burnt.
Low broad bank exposed - said

trees of oak & elm, all about
50 years' growth.
Ridge-&-furrow occurs in 
old pasture on the islands of
Stickney & Sibsey.
[17654-17655]
The countryside from Grantham
to Newark and from there east-
ward across Lincs is of very
large (50-300 ac.) arable and
ley fields, with modern haw-
thorn hedges. The latter are
usually straight and are kept 
well trimmed to an A profile
some 3-4ft high - including
non-roadside hedges. Farms with-
out hedges or with gappy or
untrimmed hedges are rare.
Hedgerow trees very few, ash
the most commonest sp. Mixed
hedges very rare, mostly in the 
neighbourhood of villages. Road-
side verges are uniformly dull,
even Anthriscus being ill developed.
Very steep hill to the Lincoln
Edge at Harmston.
Potterhanworth Wood. Much
coniferized, lies in a hollow.
No timber-framed buildings 
seen in Lincs.
Tall thin mill-towers are
characteristic of the South Riding.
Stenigot. A remarkable steep-
sided cirque with woods and
grass slopes of some 40°, prob-
ably owing to outcrop of Red
Chalk. Woods seem to be 
mainly ash, but much conifer-
ized.
Red Hill. The surface of the
intact chalk has complex ridges
and hollows. It has been
largely buried in gravelly 
head material which has crept
down from above. Most of this
[17656-17657]
is white chalk - the junction
between red and white is very
abrupt - but smears of red
chalk reappear in the upper
layers.
Good chalk grassland
(Poterium etc).
Farforth & Oxcombe Woods.
Mostly on steep N. facing slopes
of coombes. They appear to be
plantations of ash and syca-
more, but with elder dominant
in several places where these
trees have disappeared or 
where woodland has invaded
adjoining land. Good example
due W. of Farforth, with rough
grassland in bottom of coombe.
Bag Enderby. Magnificent
old pollard elms at junction
N.W. of church. Some 6ft
dia., hollow, c-type. Also
a glabra-type elm with
huge globular crown like those
at Waldingfield.
Skendleby Long Barrow. Pos-
sibly not the same as the one on
the O.S.; this one is halfway
down the valley side, long
plowed over. The west end is
now being excavated.
Old Bolingbroke. Large castle
apparently polygonal with corner
towers. Walls - presumably
excavated - stand about 8ft
high.
[17658-17659]
Carrstone. Used for most churches
& some houses in the Wolds.
(Clunch is not used). Usually
in rough ashlar blocks with wide
joints. Also used for Old Boling-
broke Castle.
The hedged landscape ex-
tends some way into the Fens,
particularly on the Stickford &
Stickney islands. No mixed
hedges seen.
Elms. Many c-type in Boston.
The marginal houses of
Stickney & Sibsey are built on
dykes round the islands.

Bagley Wood.
Seen near middle of W. side.
No boundary bank - has prob-
ably had a wood-pasture history.
Few old oaks, Q robur, gnarled
and spreading.
Apparently very acid site - bram-
bles, Deschampsia flex.
Mostly conifer plantations
- many species including Douglas
and Abies - from the latter 19th
cent. Now at or past timber ma-
turity. Very well-grown and of
handsome appearance.
The oak plantations are of
Q. petraea, some 40 years' growth,
closely-spaced (c.20ft). Tall
and rather straight, with few
branches in the lower 30ft.
About 9"-12" dia. They are
somewhat variable. Maximum
straight length perhaps 40ft.
No n/w or pollards seen.
HEN WOOD, SUNNINGWELL - card

13 May. HALIFAX HALL OXFORD
the water-
-meadows between Headington
and Oxford, south of Mesopotamia
Walk, are very extensive and 
well maintained. Aboout 100 acres
of unimproved grassland, evidently
grazed, divided by arms of the 
river and mixed hedges.
University Parks are some-
what municipal; improved grass-
land, no old trees.
The islands N. of Magdalen 
Bridge are somewhat similar to
the meadows: improved grassland,
belts of trees, apparently derived
from hedges that divided up the
islands.
