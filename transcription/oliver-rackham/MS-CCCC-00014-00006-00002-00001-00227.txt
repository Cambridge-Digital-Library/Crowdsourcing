(church).
Gale damage as severe in 
Brent Eleigh as in Walding-
[17610-17611]
field or Cambridge. Numerous
elms & limes in groves on the
steep gravel sides of the valley
have been uprooted.
There were originally 9 limes
in Lavenham chuchyard: one
disappeared at an early stage.
The growth of their bases has
forced the churchyard wall
into 8 bulges sustained by
buttresses. Some of these but-
tresses are of early-19th-cent,
brickwork at latest.   [SYMBOL].
1 April.
BUFF WOOD.
MADINGLEY WOOD.
No sign of any action about
the Wimpole elms.
Trifolium [!!!!]suffocatum[!!!!]subterraneum. shown
me by D.E. Coombe at Gamlingay.
The site, 235520, is where
a lane forming a slight
holloway has been bulldozed
back on the inside of a
left-hand bend, creating a
steep bank with a level
verge some 20ft wide below
it. All this is in soft sandy
soil. Judging by the new
hedge planted at the top of
the bank, the work was done
[17612-17613]
4 years ago.
The verge is largely unvege-
tated compact sand. Trifolium
subterraneum occurs as patches 
up to about 1ft across, each
consisting of a few hundred
tiny plants of a deep purple
colour. Several other possibly
interesting spp, including ?T.
striatum, also occur.
S.E. of the lane is a fallow
field which had a crop of
beans grown on bamboos. One
big plant of T. subterraneum,
about a foot across, with leaves
having a uniquely complex ar-
rangement of light & dark
markings.
Several big oaks standing
in this field.
[!!!!]Arabis turrita[!!!!] Turritis glabra occurred
until recently on the opposite
bank of the lane. Now lost
by the building of a house &
garden above the bank & con-
sequent eutrophication.
Gnaphalium sylvaticum. Also
refound by D.E. Coombe at
Gamlingay after a lapse of
40 years. On Heath Road,
231519.
Site is very similar - a
cutback (in this case c. 10years
old) on the inside of a 
(very slight) bend of a
shallow holloway. Ground
rather more vegetated, with
[17614-17615]
small broom bushe, but kept
mown.
Gn. sylvaticum occurs as
about 100 plants, flowering
vigorously, halfway up the bank.
Gn. uliginosum occurs on
the verge below - a slightly
wetter habitat (Q.:Ampthill
Clay?)
Park Plantations. Mainly birch
wood (?ex-plantation).
Waresley Park. Ancient oaks
& chestnuts few, decrepit, mostly
in S.E. of park.
2 April

tween Linton & Horseheath.

in Chalkney Fen, 870282.

fruit-trees.

some felled & replanted.
Rand's Wood. Intact, largely elm.

of brown of 5-6 years' growth
around the edges of the
woods and the heath at
Tiger Hill, and around
[17618-17619]
[!!!!]Kedge's[!!!!] Wright's Plantation.
There is a great deal of

tall dark grass, no base

zone and ap-
peared to be
produced by
two partial
rings which
had met.
Probably due 
to Lycoperdon saccatum
which fruits abundantly
in the lawn.

On the Breydon side there are
various decayed revetments

level is between D & E, with
dense turf (Agropyron pungens
&c.) and lower-growing patches
including Cochlearia.

Silted-up creek,

staithe, supposed site

piles prevented flooding.

HAYLEY WOOD.
16 April. LAVENDER COTTAGE GT WALDINGFIELD
Great pendu-
lous elm opposite Gt W. church.
158 y. at some 18ft up,
where about 4ft dia. Tree
must have started life about 1800.
Suckering kind; the clone runs

20 ft.
[DIAG]
[17630a-17631a]
[17632-17633]
Another elm in the N.W.
corner of the churchyard, recently
felled, 103y. at about 3ft dia.
Apparently procera x carpin.
The fallen pendulous elm
had a cavity some 4ft dia. in
the base of the trunk, extending
about  6ft up. This was lined
with black zone-plates. Rots of
various kinds, chiefly yellowish
homogeneous (? Polyp. squamosus)
and brown homogeneous (gano-
derma, of which a sporophore
with 2 1/2 layers of tubes was
found inside the cavity). No
evidence of Fomes ulmarius.
Trimming churchyard hedge
to free hedgerow trees, tying back
dog-rose fallen into churchyard,
planting potatoes. Good Friday.
17 April.
Turning compost-heap
measuring 9ft x 5ft x 6ft high
and making two smaller heaps
including other material.
A nest of rats consisting of 
the mother and 11 young was 
found in a heap of recent
compost. Young rats slightly 
smaller than a mouse, with
fully-formed fur, but eyes
not open. When disturbed they
were silent and slow-moving,
seeking the shade.
Large numbers of a big
red-spider about 4mm long
inhabit the partly-rotted grass
of the old heap. 8 short
legs. Bright pinkish scarlet.
Flat-bodied. Same as seen
[17634-17635]
recently in Chalkeney Wood.
Small pockets of the heap
were warm.
The old heap was shaken
apart, interlayered with newer
material, and the layers
watered and liberally sprinkled
with powdered chalk and ac-
clerator.
No woms found in the
heap. Agrostis stolonifera and
bamboos are particularly tenacious
of life.
The rooks in the churchyard
are more numerous than ever
this year. They dislike being
walked beneath and fly
noisily off the nest. The twigs
of the three elms dead of DED
have almost entirely disap-
peared, largely twisted off by
the rooks for nest-material.
A cabbage-heart brought
into the house and taken 
to pieces leaf by leaf sud-
denly sprouted as the last
leaves were removed and
elongated to about 7" long.
Potatoes just appearing -
from earlier planting.
18 April.
To church in Long Melford.
Primroses, cowslips, oxlips, and
PO hybrids all in flower in
the garden.
