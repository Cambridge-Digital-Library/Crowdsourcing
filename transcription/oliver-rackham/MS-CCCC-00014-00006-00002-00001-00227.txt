Gale damage as severe in

[17610-17611]
field or Cambridge. Numerous
elms & limes in groves on the
steep gravel sides of the valley
have been uprooted.
There were originally 9 limes
in Lavenham chuchyard: one
disappeared at an early stage.
The growth of their bases has
forced the churchyard wall
into 8 bulges sustained by
buttresses. Some of these but-
tresses are of early-19th-cent,
brickwork at latest.   [SYMBOL].
1 April.
BUFF WOOD.
MADINGLEY WOOD.
No sign of any action about
the Wimpole elms.
Trifolium [!!!!]suffocatum[!!!!]subterraneum. shown
me by D.E. Coombe at Gamlingay.
The site, 235520, is where
a lane forming a slight
holloway has been bulldozed
back on the inside of a
left-hand bend, creating a
steep bank with a level
verge some 20ft wide below
it. All this is in soft sandy
soil. Judging by the new
hedge planted at the top of
the bank, the work was done
[17612-17613]
4 years ago.
The verge is largely unvege-
tated compact sand. Trifolium
subterraneum occurs as patches 
up to about 1ft across, each
consisting of a few hundred
tiny plants of a deep purple
colour. Several other possibly
interesting spp, including ?T.
striatum, also occur.
S.E. of the lane is a fallow
field which had a crop of
beans grown on bamboos. One
big plant of T. subterraneum,
about a foot across, with leaves
having a uniquely complex ar-
rangement of light & dark
markings.
Several big oaks standing
in this field.
[!!!!]Arabis turrita[!!!!] Turritis glabra occurred
until recently on the opposite
bank of the lane. Now lost
by the building of a house &
garden above the bank & con-
sequent eutrophication.
Gnaphalium sylvaticum. Also
refound by D.E. Coombe at
Gamlingay after a lapse of
40 years. On Heath Road,
231519.
Site is very similar - a
cutback (in this case c. 10years
old) on the inside of a 
(very slight) bend of a
shallow holloway. Ground
rather more vegetated, with
[17614-17615]
small broom bushe, but kept
mown.
Gn. sylvaticum occurs as
about 100 plants, flowering
vigorously, halfway up the bank.
Gn. uliginosum occurs on
the verge below - a slightly
wetter habitat (Q.:Ampthill
Clay?)
Park Plantations. Mainly birch
wood (?ex-plantation).
Waresley Park. Ancient oaks
& chestnuts few, decrepit, mostly
in S.E. of park.
2 April
CHALKNEY WOOD.
Main road being widened b-
tween Linton & Horseheath.
BLACK POPLAR - some 12
middle-aged trees ina  row 
in a hedge along the northern
watercourse in Sible Hedingham,
775352.
There are a few acres of
sheep-grazed permanent pasture
in Chalkney Fen, 870282.
The cottage shown on the A[????]yse
map at 869282 has only recently
disappeared: a few remains of 
fruit-trees.
[17616-17617]
3 April.
My oxlips in the Sarcophagus
appears to be at least a fort-
night to flowering.
Fairy-rings in Leckhampton

and much faster in growth
than the rest of the grass.

ture at Balsham, 581502.

Ashen, 757435.
Tiger Hill Committee (with William
Palmer).
No further felling of dead
elms has een done at Tiger
Hill.
Temple Wood, Lit. Thurlow.
No trace remains: [!!!!]the[!!!!] area
is divided into rectilinear
fields.
Mill Plantation, W. Wratting.
Apparently mainly conifers:
some felled & replanted.
Rand's Wood. Intact, largely elm.
There is now a great deal
of brown of 5-6 years' growth
around the edges of the
woods and the heath at
Tiger Hill, and around
[17618-17619]
[!!!!]Kedge's[!!!!] Wright's Plantation.
There is a great deal of
hedgeless country around
the Belchamps.

appears to mark the site.

with a large green.

HAYLEY WOOD.
Fine day with broken cloud.
Force 5 wind from N.W. Out-
ward ride took 1 1/4h - home-ward
35 min.
6 April.
MADINGLEY WOOD.
The big fairy-ring (3
April) has been dug up 
by the Gardeners. It
was about 2ft wide, with
tall dark grass, no base
[17620-17621]
[SYMBOL]
zone and ap-
peared to be
produced by
two partial
rings which
had met.
Probably due 
to Lycoperdon saccatum
which fruits abundantly
in the lawn.
