A Chrysanthemum plant

Devil's Ditch. Each head
was borne on a stalk
[SYMBOL] " X [SYMBOL] " at the top, the
fasciation developing gra-
dually. Each disk was
somewhat 8-shaped and
bent round, one being

5127
very much bent. The
arrangement of para-

stichies is very wonder-
ful ; a kind of hexagon-
al packing is observed
in the waist, whose
three sets of rows connect
up in different ways with
the three sets of para-
stichies in each of the
two end segments. The
whole is as well ordered
as in a normal head.

sumably a palmella.
October 30.
The great wiilow (S.
fragilis) by Silver Street
bridge is being cut down.
It had been held up by
wire ropes since the
construction and repair
work to the new Silver
Street bridge in 1958-60,
in which a large branch

5129
was cut away and the 
root system severely damaged.
This year, its lvs fell prre-
maturely (early October). On
the cut stump of a main
branch, c.10 ft from the
ground, the bark has fallen
off to reveal the leading
edge of a continuous white
mycelial sheet. There is
not much heart rot.
October 31.
The pear tree affected
by Armillaria in Pembroke
garden is dropping its lvs
prematurely, especially
on the side where the
big clump of toadstools
was last year.

The framework of
the outer walls of an
ancient timber-framed
house being demolished in
Little St Mary's lane is
almost entirely destroyed
by a damp cubical
brown rot. The roof
was in bad condition
due probably to cemented
tiles: the rafters had
partly collapsed.

Nicky was brought

November 3.
No Armillaria has
been seen so far.

November 8.
The great willow tree 
near Queens' new court,
overhanging the N.W. corner
of Silver Street bridge, has
been cut down. A large
limb was cut off flush
with the trunk at the
time of rebuilding the
bridge (1958-60) and the
cut surface was showing

[5134-5135]
5134
some signs of decay.
The tree had been held
up with much wire rope
since that time. This
October, its lvs fell about
a month early.
There was evidence
of a severe and rapidly
advancing Armillaria
attack, doubtless due
to extensive damage to
the roots in digging the
foundations of the
bridge and in the pro-
longed works, probably
with grouting, afterwards
found necessary to
stabilize this end of
it. There was no
externally visible evidence

5135
apart from lf-fall. The
leading edge of a
continuous mycelial
sheet had advanced
about 10ft above the
ground on a main
branch on the river
side.     [DIAG]
Much
mycelial
tissue was
found in
the bark and outer
wood all round the
base and roots of the
tree, except in the N.W.
quadrant. There was
little aggregation, the
most developed struc-
ture being a thin dark

[5136-5137]
5136
gray fanlike sheet inter-
mediate between a
zone line and a rhizo-
morph. This was only
found at the extreme
base. The rotten wood
had a very strong
rancid smell and
the mycelial sheets glowed
brightly in the dark.
November 9.
In two dozen
sunflower plants grown
to about the third lf -
- pair stage for the
purpose of transpiration
experiments, the following
abnormalities have
been found:
1. A single lf appears

5137
above the cotyledons, and
above this a whorl of three
almost equally spaced
and at the same level.
The next three lvs are
in an exact whorl
alternating with this. Above
this is also an almost
exact whorl of three.
2. A whorl of    [DIAG]
three above
the cotyledons,
one of which
is unequally
bifurcate at the
tip, the midrib being
double from the base. Above
the whorl are pairs.
3. One of the first pair
above the cotyledons is

[5138-5139]
5138
slightly forked   [DIAG]
at the tip.
4. One of the
2nd pair above
the cotyledons
is unequally bifur-
cate with double mid-
rib from the      [DIAG]
base. Above
is an un-
equal whorl
of three,
and yet
higher alter-
nate lvs.
5. The first pair above
the cotyle-       [DIAG]
dons are
on the
same side

5139
of the stem and fused at
the base. Above is an
unequal whorl of three,
followed by alternate lvs.
6. As 4, but the first lf
above the cotyledons is
unequally         [DIAG]
trifurcate
with three
midribs from the
base.
7. Between the [????]1st[????] and
3rd pairs above the cotyledons
is a single lf.
8. The first pair above
the cotyledons as in 5, but
with a sheathing base, and
followed by normal pairs.
9. As in 2, but the whorl of
three comes at the 2nd

[5140-5141]
5140
node above the cotyledons.
10. As 2, but the whorl
not exactly all at the same
point of insertion, and
the venation of the
forked one irregular.
11. As 4,         [DIAG]
but both
lvs of
the 1st
pair are
slightly forked.
12. As 4, but
the forked lf is more deep-
ly divided, with a vena-
tion similar to that of
the abnormal lf in 10.
November 10.
The stump of the Silver
Street willow (S. fragilis)

5141

November 18.
Large tufts of Armil-
laria are developing (but
not yet complete) in
John's Wilderness, by
Queens' Road. The
tufts are associated
with the old stumps, but
some are several feet
from a stump and one
tuft is within 2ft of
a big horsechestnut.
There is only one tuft
on the Trinity Piece side.
Recent frosts have not
stopped development.

November 19.
Round the base of
the large Ailanthus
near the Pterocarya in
the Botanic Gardens are
many tufts of Pholiota
squarrosa. They occur
all round on the
wood in the bays
between main roots.
The whole interior
of the tree is entirely
rotten.
A willow tree which
blew down recently
on the outside of the
peninsula in the lake
was found to be full
of Armillaria. None
could be found today

5145
on the rotten logs with
which the bark of the
peninsula is made up.
A small coypu is
reported to have been
found dead in the road
exactly opposite the house
in Harvey Lane.
November 20.
Several tufts of Armil-
laria, some large, have
appeared in the rough
grass between the lawn
and the small pond
on the E. side of Pem-
broke, between the pear
tree and the avenue.
There is only one, poorly
developed, on this lawn
itself. There is one

[5146-5147]
5146
about 3ft W. of the
pear tree. There are
many small trees
and bushes in the
rough grass.
November 21.
The Rhodobryum, Dicran-
um rugosum, and Ptilium
planted in pots on Oct.
31 are still alive. They
have flourished following
covering with polythene
sheet.

Pembroke is still growing
despite several hard
frosts.
