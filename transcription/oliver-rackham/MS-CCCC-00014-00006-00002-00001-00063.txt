The great wiilow (S.
fragilis) by Silver Street
bridge is being cut down.
It had been held up by
wire ropes since the
construction and repair
work to the new Silver
Street bridge in 1958-60,
in which a large branch

5129
was cut away and the 
root system severely damaged.
This year, its lvs fell prre-
maturely (early October). On
the cut stump of a main
branch, c.10 ft from the
ground, the bark has fallen
off to reveal the leading
edge of a continuous white
mycelial sheet. There is
not much heart rot.
October 31.
The pear tree affected
by Armillaria in Pembroke
garden is dropping its lvs
prematurely, especially
on the side where the
big clump of toadstools
was last year.

The framework of
the outer walls of an
ancient timber-framed
house being demolished in
Little St Mary's lane is
almost entirely destroyed
by a damp cubical
brown rot. The roof
was in bad condition
due probably to cemented
tiles: the rafters had
partly collapsed.

November 8.
The great willow tree 
near Queens' new court,
overhanging the N.W. corner
of Silver Street bridge, has
been cut down. A large
limb was cut off flush
with the trunk at the
time of rebuilding the
bridge (1958-60) and the
cut surface was showing

[5134-5135]
5134
some signs of decay.
The tree had been held
up with much wire rope
since that time. This
October, its lvs fell about
a month early.
There was evidence
of a severe and rapidly
advancing Armillaria
attack, doubtless due
to extensive damage to
the roots in digging the
foundations of the
bridge and in the pro-
longed works, probably
with grouting, afterwards
found necessary to
stabilize this end of
it. There was no
externally visible evidence

5135
apart from lf-fall. The
leading edge of a
continuous mycelial
sheet had advanced
about 10ft above the
ground on a main
branch on the river
side.     [DIAG]
Much
mycelial
tissue was
found in
the bark and outer
wood all round the
base and roots of the
tree, except in the N.W.
quadrant. There was
little aggregation, the
most developed struc-
ture being a thin dark

[5136-5137]
5136
gray fanlike sheet inter-
mediate between a
zone line and a rhizo-
morph. This was only
found at the extreme
base. The rotten wood
had a very strong
rancid smell and
the mycelial sheets glowed
brightly in the dark.
November 9.
In two dozen
sunflower plants grown
to about the third lf -
- pair stage for the
purpose of transpiration
experiments, the following
abnormalities have
been found:
1. A single lf appears

5137
above the cotyledons, and
above this a whorl of three
almost equally spaced
and at the same level.
The next three lvs are
in an exact whorl
alternating with this. Above
this is also an almost
exact whorl of three.
2. A whorl of    [DIAG]
three above
the cotyledons,
one of which
is unequally
bifurcate at the
tip, the midrib being
double from the base. Above
the whorl are pairs.
3. One of the first pair
above the cotyledons is

[5138-5139]
5138
slightly forked   [DIAG]
at the tip.
4. One of the
2nd pair above
the cotyledons
is unequally bifur-
cate with double mid-
rib from the      [DIAG]
base. Above
is an un-
equal whorl
of three,
and yet
higher alter-
nate lvs.
5. The first pair above
the cotyle-       [DIAG]
dons are
on the
same side

5139
of the stem and fused at
the base. Above is an
unequal whorl of three,
followed by alternate lvs.
6. As 4, but the first lf
above the cotyledons is
unequally         [DIAG]
trifurcate
with three
midribs from the
base.
7. Between the [????]1st[????] and
3rd pairs above the cotyledons
is a single lf.
8. The first pair above
the cotyledons as in 5, but
with a sheathing base, and
followed by normal pairs.
9. As in 2, but the whorl of
three comes at the 2nd

[5140-5141]
5140
node above the cotyledons.
10. As 2, but the whorl
not exactly all at the same
point of insertion, and
the venation of the
forked one irregular.
11. As 4,         [DIAG]
but both
lvs of
the 1st
pair are
slightly forked.
12. As 4, but
the forked lf is more deep-
ly divided, with a vena-
tion similar to that of
the abnormal lf in 10.

not yet complete) in
John's Wilderness, by
Queens' Road. The
tufts are associated
with the old stumps, but
some are several feet

Round the base of
the large Ailanthus
near the Pterocarya in
the Botanic Gardens are
many tufts of Pholiota
squarrosa. They occur
all round on the
wood in the bays
between main roots.
The whole interior
of the tree is entirely
rotten.
A willow tree which
blew down recently
on the outside of the
peninsula in the lake
was found to be full
of Armillaria. None
could be found today

5145
on the rotten logs with
which the bark of the
peninsula is made up.
A small coypu is
reported to have been
found dead in the road
exactly opposite the house
in Harvey Lane.
November 20.
Several tufts of Armil-
laria, some large, have
appeared in the rough
grass between the lawn
and the small pond
on the E. side of Pem-
broke, between the pear
tree and the avenue.
There is only one, poorly
developed, on this lawn
itself. There is one

about 3ft W. of the
pear tree. There are
many small trees
and bushes in the
rough grass.

Heavy snowfall all
day. In the morning, the-
ground was warm and
none settled. Towards
evening, about 3 in. had

At Cambridge, the
general depth of snow
is about 8 in. The strong
N.W. wind has caused
impaction on buildings

such as telegraph poles
have a sharp edged
triangular ridge of snow
on the windward side,
while globes cary hori-
zontal cones of snow.
There is not much
drifting, but some smaller

the Fens, small dunes
of snow occur in
some fields. Each is
based on some pro-
jection such as a
clod of earth or a
celery-box. They occur
in shoals and are
strictly vertical to the
wind. Some lie oblique-
ly across the ridges
of celery fields. The
river at Ely is frozen
over.
The weight of
snow has bent over
trees and bushes

The river is entirely
frozen over except for
small patches under
some bridges, the Mill
pool as far as Essex
building, the upper river
between the two weirs,
and a small pool below
the adjustable weir. The
whole Granta pool is
frozen. About half the
area of ice carries a
light sprinkling of snow,
the rest none. As the
river level sank, the ice
broke at the edges
with the sound of a

[5170-5171]
5170
pistol.
The ducks feed
on the ice. They have
no difficulty in climb-
ing on to the edge.
They slip on the
surface.
Sparrows also feed
on the ice and also
slip.
January 3.
There was a further
slight fall of snow.
All the dykes
and becks in the
fen are frozen, even
the swift dyke
which connects the
upper and lower
rivers across Sheep's

5171
Green.
The snow has broken
branches off cedars in
Leckhampton Grounds.
Other trees damaged in
Cambridge include:
Pear (uprooted in Fanshawe
garden)
Almond (uprooted in St Bot-
olph's churchyard)
Plum (branches commonly
broken off)
Lilac [SYMBOL] (branches broken off)
Holm-oak
Laurel (branches commonly broken)

The dry rot in the Porters'
bedroom originated in the
bathroom above, and
spread downwards, taking

[5172-5173]
5172
the ends of the ceil-
ing joists.
There was a slow
thaw today.

Only small traces
of heaps of snow re-
main in Ipswich.
The large pond is
completely frozen in the
park, though the ice
is partly submerged.
The small pond is
quite free. The lake
is about half covered.
Gulls land and
walk about the ice
as on the ground,
without slipping.
At the lake margin,
below the hill, a
medium-sized horse-
-chestnut has been
cut down. It was

[5174-5175]
5174
moribund or dead. The
base is almost
completely rotten with
a cheesey white rot
with abundant zone
lines. The rot extends
upwards, mainly super-
ficially, for at least
25 ft, and there is
some heart rot as
well. Organisms found
were
Armillaria: suggested
as the main destroyer
by the zone lines and
mycelial sheets; but no
rhizomorphs were seen.
Collybia velutipes: a
tuft of sporophores about
6ft up.

5175
Trichoderma?: a green
mould present under
some of the bark.
Bark beetles: a few
galleries found
The top of the
ruinous lime at the
N.E.corner of the square
has collapsed altogether,
leaving a stump about
10ft high. The exten-
sive heart-rot in this
stump shows black
zone plates.
A red squirrel
was seen on the hill.
In the log-dump
on the top of the hill,
the following fungi
flourish:

[5176-5177]

Stereum hirsutum
S. purpureum
Collybia velutipes
January 8.    [DIAG]
Very little snow re-
mains apart from heaps.
January 9.
Most of the heaps of
snow are now gone.
January 10.
The dead branches
have been removed
from the larger of the
two dying-back willows
on Sheep's Green, and
all the branches of the
smaller. The Ganoderma
in the latter appears
to have stopped acti
vity. Zone lines occur

5177
sparsely in the dead wood.
January 11.
What is apparently a
resupinate form of Stereum
purpureum grows on
the exposed wood of
the split trunk of the
large pollard willow on
Laundress Green, part
of which was brought
down by a gale last
winter.
January 12.
The last remains of
snow have melted.
January 13.
The river is high
and fast flowing and
much of Sheep's Green
has been flooded.

Carex paniculata or
appropinquata forms big
tussocks in a small bog
by the railway at
Whittlesford.
1 [SYMBOL] mosses found in an
2          arable field at Pampis-
3          ford.
Ganoderma applanatum
was seen on two large
and decayed beeches at
Whittlesford.
In the park at Whittles-
ford is a hornbeam bear-
ing some hundreds of
witches' brooms up to c.2ft

5179
diam. They have a rugged
woody centre with long
twigs coming from it. Most
of them are at the ends
of small branches. They often
fall off.
There are a few other
hornbeams at Whittlesford.
A barked horse-chest-
nut in the park at Whittles-
ford is dead.
In the same place are
several very old elm
trees of great size, most
very rotten and partly col-
lapsed.
At Whittlesford is an
elm with twiggy scabs.
January 15.
Two small crocuses

a pot.
January 16.
A large Kohlreutheria,
growing near the red house
which is between the
convent and the first of
the plant-houses at the
Gardens, is said to
have died suddenly. On
cutting down, it was
found to be full of
Armillaria. The source
of infection is a complete
mystery.
January 17.
In the spinney at the
Gardens, one of the in-
fected [!!!!] stumps and

5181
the uninfected ash remain
in the ground.

The Viburnum was
moved from under
the pear tree to
between the "Cox"
and the large moun-
tain ash, almost
exactly on the site of
the "BoB". Root system
large, compact, fibrous.
The small gooseberry
has been moved from
just in front of the
Dr H to the site of
the Viburnum.  Root
system rather large and
deep.
Six gladioli were
recovered, buried about
4 in. deep, apparently

5183
unharmed by frost.

Bryological excursion to
Madingley.
Three sites:

[5184-5185]
5184
(1) Stubble field in the acute
angle between the road
to Madingley and the St
Neot's road (412,594). Boul-
der clay with patches of
a thin white crust, possibly
lime.
(2) Wrangling Corner Wood.
Mixed wood on gault.
(3) Lady-bush Close (412,605).
The same. A wide variety
of conifers.
Moss numbers:
4: Ephemerum recurvifolium.
Abundant over a
small area (a few sq. yards)
of the stubble field, and
locally dominant.  Mainly
on the white crust, also on
earth. Protonema very abun-

5185
dant. The plants are
exceedingly small, reminis-
cent in appearance of
Phascum cuspidatum. Cells
of the capsule just visi-
ble. No other moss
grows among the proto-
nema, except occasional
plants of Pottia. The
Ephemerum is not yet
quite ripe.

5. Pottia bryoides?
Lid beaked.
Abundant in the field.
Apparently not very distinct
from the next.

6. Pottia davalliana (minutula).
Lid conical.
