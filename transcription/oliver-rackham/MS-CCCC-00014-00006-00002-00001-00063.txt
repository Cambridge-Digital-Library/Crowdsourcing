[SYMBOL]Rhytidiadelphus loreus.

One tuft with the
above.

The last five spp were
all found within a few
yards of each other.
Silene nutans is abun-
dant in a stubble field at
Horningsea.
A Chrysanthemum plant
bearing two fasciated
heads was seen by the
Devil's Ditch. Each head
was borne on a stalk
[SYMBOL] " X [SYMBOL] " at the top, the
fasciation developing gra-
dually. Each disk was
somewhat 8-shaped and
bent round, one being

5127
very much bent. The
arrangement of para-

[DIAG]

stichies is very wonder-
ful ; a kind of hexagon-
al packing is observed
in the waist, whose
three sets of rows connect
up in different ways with
the three sets of para-
stichies in each of the
two end segments. The
whole is as well ordered
as in a normal head.

[5128-5129]

A. Collema sp.
Abundant in short turf,
Devil's Ditch.

Large dark green
translucent blobs of gela-
tinous matter, up to 2 in.
diam., were found in
short turf, Devil's Ditch. Pre-
sumably a palmella.
October 30.
The great wiilow (S.
fragilis) by Silver Street
bridge is being cut down.
It had been held up by
wire ropes since the
construction and repair
work to the new Silver
Street bridge in 1958-60,
in which a large branch

5129
was cut away and the 
root system severely damaged.
This year, its lvs fell prre-
maturely (early October). On
the cut stump of a main
branch, c.10 ft from the
ground, the bark has fallen
off to reveal the leading
edge of a continuous white
mycelial sheet. There is
not much heart rot.
October 31.
The pear tree affected
by Armillaria in Pembroke
garden is dropping its lvs
prematurely, especially
on the side where the
big clump of toadstools
was last year.
November 1.

[5130-5131]
5130
The framework of
the outer walls of an
ancient timber-framed
house being demolished in
Little St Mary's lane is
almost entirely destroyed
by a damp cubical
brown rot. The roof
was in bad condition
due probably to cemented
tiles: the rafters had
partly collapsed.
November 2.
Nicky was brought
in about four days ago.
November 3.
No Armillaria has
been seen so far.
November 4.    64 H.L.
