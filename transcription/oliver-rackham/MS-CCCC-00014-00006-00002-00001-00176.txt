Incipient gleyed podsol

mineral horizon.

The inside of the "moat" is
a dark area of dense young
birch.  No trace of old coppice.
A few mouldering conifer stumps
and logs were found by
careful search.  Frangula
frequent.  Very little ground
cover, and what there is is
mainly Dryopteris.

  These pH measurements
were made in situ.  The
Sphagnum was determined on
big tufts. 
  Convallaria is scattered
over perhaps 1/2 acre, of very
acid vegetation with dying
tangled birch scrub and
occasional big spreading oaks.
  No flowers seen.

  Oxlips occur within about
20 yards of Sphagnum.

   Allium flowers are most
spectacular, white like snow ([SYMBOL]

whatever plant communities would
be there without it.
