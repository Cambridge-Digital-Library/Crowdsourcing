[DIAG]

1. Wood-bank very variable.
Strong and submarginal on
the road side.  Elsewhere 
generally weak.
2. Complex intensl earthworks, 
including almost certainly an
old wood-bank.
3. Numerous internal ponds
and hollows.
4. Poor coppice structure.  All
3287
the large standards gone.  Cop-
pice more evidenr than at
Hintlesham.
5. Large assemblage of trees &
shrubs including hornbeam and
holly.
6. Combination of light snd
heavy woodland types, much
less extensive.  [!!!!] Mainly
wet and stagnant (cf Ramsey
Wood).
7. Few exotics, sycamore
invasion moderate.
8. Excellent hornbeam.  Dis-
persal is unusual.  Present
as standards,large asnd small
coppice.  Standard hornbeams
([SYMBOL] 9) among the largest known,

[13282-13283]
3282
surpassing those at Fakenham
and probably Buff. Hornbeams
in small groups, in heavy &
moderately light woodland.
9. Primrose present but not
oxlip.
10. Very little elm.
11. apparently no bluebell.

  The status of this wood is
very obscure.  The numerous
internal earthworks appear to
make it partly secondary.
The massive ditch running
through the N.E. part of
the wood is probably the
old wood margin, especially
3283
as it runs out into the liberty
boundary at its E. end. The
change of orientation may
be due to the fct that it is
primarily the liberty boundary,
or may be dictated by a 
need to make the drainage 
flow S.W. into the stream
instead of N.E. as it would
flow by gravity.
  The evidence thany
of the wood is primary is
not strong.  Sinuous outline
and strong wood-bank, espe-
cially towards the road.
Numerous black holes asnd
an apparently natural stream.
On the other hand the
coppice structure is poorly de-

[13284-13285]
3284
veloped (but cf Hintlesham),
and mercury is the only de-
finite ancient woodland plant
present.
  The internal ditches do
not agree with the parish boun-
daries and the latter are
probably wrong on the O.S.

A.  Small area of beech
ex-coppice.  Stools
up to c. 2 ft
across (mainly
once-cuts?).
Poles up to    [DIAG]
c. 40 ft high and 9 m. dia.,
seldom more than 2 per
stool.  Beech treated as large
coppice in a pure stand with
no standards or other cop-
pice.  Little ground cover.
  This is surrounded by
a much larger area of
mainly pure beech wood of
standards only.  No pollards.
  The wood bank is a
steep narrow one about 2 2/2 ft
high (like that across the
3301
waist of Swanton Novers (Great
Wood).  Beech stools (appar-
ently derived from a hedge)
on the top of the bank.

B.  Mainly mature beech.  Some
younger beech, oak, and birch,
with a few decrepit beech
pollards.  The wood bank is
set back from the road, ap-
parently on the Burnham
- Farnham parish boundary.
No pollards to the E. of it.
Wood bank similar to that
at A, but carries coppice-type
e[rather than hedge-type
rather than hedge-type
stools.
  Thickets of holly are fre-

[13302-13303]

quent here.

C.  Mainly young apparently
secondary birch wood, with
some oak.  Scattered beech
pollards, mainly dead.

D.  Secondary woodland on
the site of East Burnham Com-
mon.  Mainly Betula pubes-
cens (some pendula), much
of it in the late thicket
stage, dense and dark.
Relict glades wikth bracken
and heather.  No pollards.

E. Surviving fragment of
East Burnham Common.  Groups
of birch and oak (some
3303
recently planted!).  To judge
by surrounding fragments in
woodland, this common pro-
bably had sizeable tracts of
bracken, gorse, and heather, but
very intense public use has
reduced it to short grass with
many bare areas.

F.  Uneven-aged woodland
with many small glades and
bracken areas.  On gravel.
Pollards are the oldest
trees.  Average about 1 1/2 to the
acre, fairly uniformly scattered.
Typically some 6 large bran-
ches.
  About 2/3 of the pollards
are beech and 1/3 oak.

[13304-13305]
3304
  [DIAG]
  
  Pollards seldom complete.
About half of them are dead
(not tidied up but allowed to
rot).  Half the remainder
have suffered serious loss of
branches.  Only about 1/4 are
intact.
  In one place, the pollards
stand each on a pillar of
gravel because pits have been
3305
dug around them, apparently as
gravel diggings.
  No dating evidence was got.
No good cut surfaces seen.
No carved dates.
  Trunks usually hollow with
complete perimeter: sometimes open
down one side.  One detached but-
tress seen (in beech).
  These trees are mostly
even in size and apparent age.
A few pollard beeches could be 
much younger.

  Other trees: birch and beech
co-dominant in patches.  Scattered
oaks.  Holly formns patches of
scrub, about 15 ft high, often
around pollards. Evidently
[13306-13307]
3306
secondary tree cover has been
steadily increasing for at least
a century.
  No evident effect of grazing
or association between holly
and young trees.  Despite very
heavy trampling on by visitors tree
regeneration still goes on.
  Herbaceous vegetation sparse.
Dominant usually Deschampsia
flexuosa.  Bracken local.
Calluna rare and never dom-
inant.

G. Recent woodland of
birch (chiefly pubescens) and
Populus tremula.  See p. 3294.

  Alopecurus geniculatus is
3307
abundant on the mud of a 
dried-up pond at Missenden Abbey.
  Sarsen stones are used for
various purposes including
setts forming a pavement around
the Abbey.  Local origin.
  Yew hedges c. 20 ft high
round the house.
  Gnat eggs form rafts floating
just below the surface of
rain-water tanks in the kitchen
garden.

  About 90% of the Hayley

over several weeks from the more
exposed pots to those in shade.
Whether or not the roots were emerged
at the time of planting had little effect.
