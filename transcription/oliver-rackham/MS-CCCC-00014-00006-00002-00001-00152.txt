Long stretches of 2nd &
3rd N. Rides are under water.
By 3rd N. Ride is an oak
struck by lightning many years
ago which continues to
live by a single branch
some 15ft up forming a
new leader. The scar runs
right to the ground where
it originally extended over. 
half way round and [????]ed
about 1/3 of the roots. This
has healed for several inches
on either side.
The base mouldering
wood is criss-crossed with

squirrel claw-marks
which are shallow scratches
at between 30[SYMBOL] and 50[SYMBOL]

[DIAG]
Scratches up to 2in long.
Growth of Protococcus
suggests that the drey
they lead to has been
in use for some time and
is still used.
3 rabbits were seen
in the N. Section. One
near the pond.
A deer was seen to cross
1499
1st N. Ride during the
coppicing operations (axes,
chain-saw, &c.) only a
block's width away. It
moved towards the coppicing
in a leisurely manner with
head down. No antlers.
A considerable flow of
water from the S.W. corner.
Many small branches
have been broken in the
crowns of the oaks in the
summer, probably by the
September gale.
Heracleum and Anthris-
cus are flowering frequently
in the roadside verges
around Bourne & Long-

stowe mown in the summer.
By the S.W. main ride is
an ivy plant some 12ft
high up a hazel. It has
assumed the tree habit and
overwhelmed the hazel. Its
trunk is some 1 1/2 in. dia.
Only one hazel stem is in-
volved. The ground system
consists of a single branch
with ground-type leaves grow-
ing up the same hazel trunk
There are no creeping shoots.
A few oxlip plants still
have some green leaves.

The ridges bear a char-
acteristic polygon pattern. Poly-
gons about 1ft across, mar-
kedly domed. In the hollows
between are deep cracks
into which twigs & debris fall.
Soil in the hollows is markedly
granular; that on the polygons
is compact. Most of the
polygons bear Deschampsia tufts,
usually etiolated or
dead, evidently dating from
a period of more open ve-
getation.

Bourn Wood.
The part belonging to Mr
Bevan has now been reduced
by clearing to the "original"
wood. Outline as on the
28.4.68 map, except for a 
slight convex bend on the E.
side.
The eastern wood can hardly be primary as at
least part is on R. & F. It may
have been an oak wood at
one time but is now almost
completely occupied by elm,
1511
like the w. wood.
Lime coppice suggests plan-
ting. Moderate size of ash
stools suggests a fairly late
date, possibly early 18th cent.
Note that the ground flora
(mercury in particular), as far
as an be ascertained at this
time, suggests long establishment.
Sycamore a fairly recent in-
vasion.
Boundary as on 28.4.68
map, except that the S.W.
boundary has a slight bend
near its S.E. end.

Elm cuttings were secured
for propagation.
Immediately W. of the

the elm timber as been re-
moved from this in the last
few years. Scrub and rough gra-
ssland are left.

pond-forming dams).
The S. wood-bank has three
old passes or gaps for over-
flow besides the one at the
S.W. corner which now functions.

[11520-11521]

1520
Site A: a rather large shallow
marshy area would result.
Site B: a dam here, although
short, would be relatively unpro-
ductive because the fall od the
ground is too great.
Site C: a dam would hae to
be about 30 yards long but
would inundate about 1/2 acre;
this could be very good if
combined with judicious felling.
Site D: the most immediately
promising. The wood-wank and
Hayley Ditch would be joined
by a short dam. An old pass
would have to be blocked. A
large deep pond would result.
The South Section Triangle
does not contain any promising
1521
sites. The East Section is possible
but unpromising.
The whole wood is very
wet, with pools in the Ash swamp
up to c.30 yards dia. The furrows
in the Triangle are filling.

thaw.
December 27.
Further periods of snow,
heavy at times and driven
by a strong N.W. wind, lying
on vertical faces of trees and
buildings including the Cathe-
dral spire. On the back
grass there were 3 1/4in.

intense frost and drying
wind.
December 28 [DIAG]
About 2 1/2 in. of snow fell
at Cambridge in the night.
Only a slight powdering
between Huntingdon and
Doncaster. Depth then
gradually increased to about
6 in. near Bishop Auckland.
From Boro'bridge onwards
on the A1 snow fell in show-
ers, with a strong N.W.
wind driving it and
bringing clouds of ice crys-
tals off the fields. The road
became difficult to see
and its edges indistinct.
Visibility a few yards at
1525
times, especially on the
motorway between Catterick
and Aycliffe.
The A689 between Rushyford
(Chilton) and Coundon (Bishop
Auckland) was similar.
The road between Westerton
(Bishop Auckland) and Todhills
(Byers Green) is a ridgeway
rising to 500ft. Drifts
with a minimum depth
of c.18 in. only just motorable
through. Snow cornices in
fantastic shapes up to 3ft
deep by the hedges.
Mild frost or possible
thaw at Todhills.

Snow fell
most of the day but there
was a slow thaw.
The warrens' garden con-
tains a fine wych-elm
and a hawthorn tree some
40ft high.
The house (like many in
the district) is built of a
soft tawny sandstone with
brown and greenish streaks
which erodes easily.
Trees in the area show
slight soot blackening
though there is no great
concentration of houses or
heavy industry. NO lichens.

Many coal tips in the
Brandon & Spenny moor areas
have been planted with
Corsican and ash of some
20 years' growth.
Durham Cathedral and
many houses in the town
are of a similar sandstone,
usually as rough blocks,
sometimes ashlar or rag.
The countryside appears
to be of relatively late inclo-
sure with straight hedges
and few stone walls. Much
altered by mining.

King-post & braces. 2
purlins. Purlins shallower
than principal rafters so
that backs of the latter are
in the same plane as the
common rafters. Common
rafters very slight (c.2x2in.)
The purlins are housed
in the principal rafters by
a very shallow tenon
prevented from dropping
out by a small through tenon
1529
pegged on the other side.
The two purlins on either side
of the truss are pegged
side by side and so are
not in the same line.
[DIAG]

[11530-11531]

1530
This is rather unsatisfactory
and in one case the peg
has allowed enough play for
the tenon to drop out.
The long tenon or tounge
has split off and the
joint has failed.
December 30.
Much of the snow melted
yesterday, but it still covers
the fields. The thickness
of ice on flooded gravel
pits and marshes in the 
valley floor just permits
skating. There is no ice
on the river.
Many sheep are out in
fields.
Soil (as revealed in a 
1531
quarry by the old railway
cutting) is rather thin and
apparently autogen[????, boulder
clay (if it occurs, as suggested
by cobblestones in the streets
of Durham and a large
erratic at Todhills) is only
on the ridges.
The rocks are alternating 
sandstones, shales, and clays,
presumably Mesozoic.
By the roadside, 208343,
are a few acres of hawthorn
scrub with few other woody
plants. Small patches of
broom & gorse. Below Willing-
ton is a small patch of
ash scrub with an understorey
of broom & gorse

Sycamores are the commonest
planted trees in the district
but soon decay and are
short-lived. Populus canescens
is occasional as big trees
at Willington.
Holly occurs in a hedge
at Todhills.
December 31.
Ridge & Furrow.
1. On flood plain at Bishop
Auckland, 208343. Narrow
straight ridges, probably a
water-meadow system.
2. Usual straight ridges, normal
width, in a paddock behind a
farm at Todshills, 212340.
3. Generally frequent along
the railway from Aycliffe,
1533
[????]o Durham, to E. Retford. Particu-
larly abundant around Darling-
ton and N. of Doncaster, less
frequent in the Selby area.
Usually straight but sometimes
curved. Reversed- S seen at [????]
Aycliffe and (partly preserved)
N. of York. On slopes and
flat land; nearly always up &
down on slopes.
4. A system of probable water
meadow channels by the Selby
Canal, Brayton.
Between Naburn and Riccall,
S. of York, are some woods by
the railway : one E. of Bell Hall,
one E. of Moreby Hall, and one (not
on 1/3in. map) E. of the railway.

[11534-11535]

1534
They appear to contain the
following types:
1. Sycamore pure large coppice.
2. Ash large coppice or once-cuts:
Standards & small coppice not
known (thinned & planted with
conifers).
3. Ash & oak standards with
ash maidens and very over-
grown ash large coppice or once
cuts. E. of railway.
Snow had fallen everywhere
along the route- least in the
Grantham-Peterboro' area.
Probably never more than
6 in. anywhere. Considerable
drifts & cornices in fen dykes
near Whittlesea.
1535
There have been severe
frosts especially where snow
cover is slight. Icicles up to
2ft long in the cornbrash
cuttings.
The Ouse Washes were
completely filled : no bushes
projecting save along the rail-
way embankment : lightly
frozen over. W. en of the
Nene Washes frozen.
No more snow appears to
have fallen at Cambridge. Hard
frost everywhere. The Leckhamp-
ton pool is covered with baout
3/4 in. thick of ice. The main
river quite clear.

[11536]

1536
Death-watch beetle has
been active until recently in
the oak joists over the old
entrance to the Old Court.
Much of the sapwood is
consumed, also knots, but
little of the heart. A few
live insects have been found.
The oak floorboars are only
occasionally penetrated. Most
severe on the underside of
the joists: the ends in the
walls on either side are
little affected. Very few holes
in the oaken le[????]ths of an
earlier ceiling preserved in
the walls. These joists were
sealed in below by a ceiling &
above by tongued & grooved boards
