N.B. No Euphorbia in this area
At beginning of Mesara there 
is some gulley erosion in a
big [SYMBOL - Greek script] - a little of this may 
still be active. No water in bottom.

The general area of the Bo[????]a
core is easily identified at Ayia
Galini. Definitely in the dry belt;
Olea and Ceratonia are the only 
trees. The river flows in a broad
single channel and is one of the big-
gest in Crete. Jenny points out that it
once had a braided course, which in
itself implies a different climate.
E. of the mouth of the Platys River
are steep cliffs of Marly Limestone.
Landscape generally resembles that
of Myrtos, but gullis are rare. Predom-
inant vegetation is that of Myrtos
types I and II.
[22512-22513]
[SYMBOL - Greek script]. Broad gravel
bed with Arundo & smaller
Tamarix.

Hill [SYMBOL - Greek script]. N. of Kamilari.

Patches on the [????] of Kamara
down to c. 1800m. On [SYMBOL - Greek script]
c. 1700. [SYMBOL - Greek script]
down to c. 1600m.
Ida has extensive snowfields
on its S. W. side. Ridges are
blown clear right to the top.

Hills around [SYMBOL - Greek script].
Gladiolus. In vast quntities in
cultivated fields, less often olive
groves. Specially characteristic of
the Asterousia; also seen around
[SYMBOL - Greek script], and in N. Crete, but 
here flowering earlier.
Phagnalon. Vast quantities in
gariga, coming into flower.
Salvia trilobe. Very common in ga-
riga, here in S. Crete early in flower.
Orchis italica. In hundreds on some
hillsides.
Borago. V. ab.
Chrysanth. [coronarium]. Whole field
of it.
[22514-22515]
Ranunculus [arcticus]. Abund-
ant, massed.

[????]. One seen at evening in
the foothills of the Asterousia.

Matthiola sinuata. The form seen
in the [Kontaliotiko] Pharangi is 
typical except for the indumentum,
which is sparse[!!!!]ly[!!!!] [!!!!]while[!!!!] with branched
hairs. Glands in siliqua stalked,
present also on the infl. branches,
stem & leaves.
[SYMBOL - tick]

Scorzonera cretica. Abundant in 
cliffs in [pharangia] and elsewhere, 
including by a house in the village
of Sellia. 
[SYMBOL - tick]

Lathyrus articulatus. [!!!!]Fields[!!!!] Tall grass near
[clymerum]
Phoenicia monastery.

Ranunculus muricatus. Freq. in
fields between Phoenicia & Sellia.
[SYMBOL - tick]

Cerinthe major. Abundant at
roadside, [????] Ag.  [SYMBOL - Greek script]. Bracts turn
purple on wilting. [SYMBOL - tick]

Muscari comosum. Hills around
[SYMBOL - Greek script], cultivated ground, freq.

Phoinikia cont. Limestone hills are
rather barren, windswept and evi-
dently heavily grazed. Vegetation prob.
too discontinuous to burn. Cali-
cotome freq. but small, probably
much grazed. Phlomis ab. and
prob. also grazed. Asphodeline ab.
(less than at [SYMBOL - Greek script]).
[22516-22517]
Hills behind [SYMBOL - Greek script] appear
to be similar ([SYMBOL] 32); very green at
this time of year, but no trees and
usually no macchia.
Little lonely beach at the cove
without palms.
Wave-cut Notches. Two notches
are very well-defined on the cliffs
around the bay of Phoinikia; about
1ft apart and 7ft above present
sea-level. They extend level around
the coast and on islets.

[SYMBOL - Greek script]. Short
but imposing gorge, narrowing towards
its N. end. Narrow, with cliff sides &
some shade. River flows through it.
Drier than the Kotsilon: note Ebenus
and absence of [SYMBOL - Greek script].

Roads, Roadworks around Spili in-
clude making short stretches of
new main road. No repairs done
to the rest of the road. J. M. says
its bad state is partly due to prior
construction; the main roads of Crete
are a monument to the Colonels'
regime; some of the road contractors 
cheated the regime [in the expecta-
tion that it would have fallen be-
fore the roads broke up.].

Mesara. Plastic glasshouses are largely
confined to the [SYMBOL - Greek script] valley
W. of [SYMBOL - Greek script]. They appear to last 2
years. Frames of wood and iron
rods.
Many houses in Tymbaki appear
to date before World War II.
[22518-22519]
HIlls S. of Mesara. Complex topog-
raphy; dry, mostly uncultivated with
gariga. Few almonds but no other
wild trees. Mainly Marly limestone.
Trapéza (p. 2512) is a hill apparently 
a deserted military post, with a
road cutting up to the top; magnifi-
cent spring flowers.
At Pachia Ammos in Kamilari are
great sand-dunes forming sizeable
hills.
Spring flowers are specially charac-
teristic of this area.

[SYMBOL - Greek script]. We tried in vain to get a room.
Village has many homes in Turkish
style (rather like that of the Itza-
kakis Villa, 2-storeyed); it is more
Turkish than any village seen hith-
erto.

Listeros. Mountain village, less arid
than most of this area, with planes
and other trees and rich herbaceous
vegetation, but no oaks.

Odigytria Monastery. In a lonely
place among extensive gariga pas-
tures, but with cultivated enclaves
not far from the monastery itself.
Fortified building with strong outer
wall. In one corner is a big square
tower like a medieval keep, ap-
parently the scene of the exploits
of the pallikare Zopateras against
the Turks (see Spanakis).

The area is full of German tour-
ists here for Easter. we sucured a
room in a small hotel near Pit-
sidhia, one of many near the
[22520-22521]
coast.

Weather. Beautiful warm sunny
day.
Extraordinary wind [!!!!] in the
morning. We could hardly stand on
the ridge-top E. of A Kastri (p. 2497);
I had to crawl at times, and
Jenny got blown down and slightly
hurt. Wind from N.; it had begun
the previous night and died down
around midday.

Fasciation in Asphodel 3/4 wide.

on Bintliff or on British map.
[DIAG]
Flock of about 30 vultures
which circled for much of the
morning over the Nio Pervoli part of
the valley. J. reports them as having
ruffs and a long featherless neck.
They flew leisurely round in cir-
cles. At one point a shepherd
fired four rounds of a rifle at
them.

Most of the upper valley is covered
with similar vegetation. No trees.

Hellenistic shards, buried by at
least 1m of slopewash.
[DIAG]
This is at the S. end of the little fan
below Ag. [SYMBOL - Greek script]. This and
the previous site are the effect of
the river cutting into the terraces.
This area is different from how
Bintliff shows it. The fan presents
a broad front and only 2 valleys con-
verge on it. The spring could not 
be found. An insignificant trickle of 
water comes down teh lateral stream.
Gullies are not specially conspic-
uous.
Giant rocks. Several scattered in
middle valley. Up to about 60ft
high. Hard schist; surface slowly
spalls off in flakes. Little vegeta-
tion. Scorzonera cretica occurs in
one.
On the summit of the Great
Red Rock opp. "Ag. [SYMBOL - Greek script] is a
curious round shaft some 4ft
dia. and at least 15ft deep
artificially hewn in the rock.
