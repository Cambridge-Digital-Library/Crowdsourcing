N.B. No Euphorbia in this area
At beginning of Mesara there 
is some gulley erosion in a
big [SYMBOL - Greek script] - a little of this may 
still be active. No water in bottom.

The general area of the Bo[????]a
core is easily identified at Ayia
Galini. Definitely in the dry belt;
Olea and Ceratonia are the only 
trees. The river flows in a broad
single channel and is one of the big-
gest in Crete. Jenny points out that it
once had a braided course, which in
itself implies a different climate.
E. of the mouth of the Platys River
are steep cliffs of Marly Limestone.
Landscape generally resembles that
of Myrtos, but gullis are rare. Predom-
inant vegetation is that of Myrtos
types I and II.

bed with Arundo & smaller
Tamarix.

Ida has extensive snowfields
on its S. W. side. Ridges are
blown clear right to the top.

Hills around [SYMBOL - Greek script].
Gladiolus. In vast quntities in
cultivated fields, less often olive
groves. Specially characteristic of
the Asterousia; also seen around
[SYMBOL - Greek script], and in N. Crete, but 
here flowering earlier.
Phagnalon. Vast quantities in
gariga, coming into flower.
Salvia trilobe. Very common in ga-
riga, here in S. Crete early in flower.

hillsides.

of it.
[22514-22515]

ant, massed.

[????]. One seen at evening in
the foothills of the Asterousia.

Matthiola sinuata. The form seen
in the [Kontaliotiko] Pharangi is 
typical except for the indumentum,
which is sparse[!!!!]ly[!!!!] [!!!!]while[!!!!] with branched
hairs. Glands in siliqua stalked,
present also on the infl. branches,
stem & leaves.
