Devonport Leat. A
well-constructed channel
about 6ft wide with
fast-flowing water. Said to be
18th-cent.

Welltown water-works. A powerful
spring is diverted by a number 
of leats and made to fill a s????
trough in the yard. In the dairy
of the house it was led in a
shallow watercourse round the
room for cooling vessels of milk.

Fine view from the triangle of
moor between Horseyeatt and Egg-
worthy. Walkham Valley with
King's, Staple, and Pew Tors. Exten-
sive woods apparently mainly of
oak. Brent Tor in the distance.
[22170-22171]
20 Nov. cont. from p.2150.
Oaks. In this area both spp.
occur; petraea is predominant
even in hedges. Petraea is very
variable and often of spreading habit.
Seems to be little doubt about
species. They probably cannot be
told apart at a distance.
Valley-bottom woods. Frequent in
Kenwyn valley, prob. recent.
Patchy structure but sometimes cop-
piced.Sallow usually dom. but
much hazel. Alder infrequent.
Weather exceedingly warm,
damp, with some drizzle.

21 Nov. from p.2150  17 GEORGE STREET
                        T R U R O
   Lecture to 
Cornwall Naturalists' Trust.
   Opera Eugene Onegin at
   Falmouth.
   Granite. Not much used in
   building at Truro except for
   pretentious buildings of 19th &
   20th cent. A paving material is
   long granite slabs (perhaps
   of a standarized size intended
   mainly for lintels).
   
   22 Nov. cont from p. 2155.
   Groves in St Agnes, 729483 and
   734478. Evidently modern.
   Oaks full-grown but very spreading
   and only c.20ft high. Dense und-
   erstorey of Rhodo. These groves
   are at 500ft alt. and 2 1/2 mi.
   from the sea. not on 1st ed OS.
   
   Hedges behind St Agnes. On the
   windswept plateau hedges are

[22172-22173]
often of furze, severely windpruned.
Oaks the commonest hedgerow trees
but max. often only 10ft or
less.
     Few elms in this area.
