Devonport Leat. A
well-constructed channel
about 6ft wide with
fast-flowing water. Said to be
18th-cent.

Welltown water-works. A powerful
spring is diverted by a number 
of leats and made to fill a s[????]
trough in the yard. In the dairy
of the house it was led in a
shallow watercourse round the
room for cooling vessels of milk.

Fine view from the triangle of
moor between Horseyeatt and Egg-
worthy. Walkham Valley with
King's, Staple, and Pew Tors. Exten-
sive woods apparently mainly of
oak. Brent Tor in the distance.
[22170-22171]
20 Nov. cont. from p.2150.
Oaks. In this area both spp.
occur; petraea is predominant
even in hedges. Petraea is very
variable and often of spreading habit.
Seems to be little doubt about
species. They probably cannot be
told apart at a distance.
Valley-bottom woods. Frequent in
Kenwyn valley, prob. recent.
Patchy structure but sometimes cop-
piced.Sallow usually dom. but
much hazel. Alder infrequent.
Weather exceedingly warm,
damp, with some drizzle.

   Lecture to 
Cornwall Naturalists' Trust.
   Opera Eugene Onegin at
   Falmouth.
   Granite. Not much used in
   building at Truro except for
   pretentious buildings of 19th &
   20th cent. A paving material is
   long granite slabs (perhaps
   of a standarized size intended
   mainly for lintels).
   
   22 Nov. cont from p. 2155.
   Groves in St Agnes, 729483 and
   734478. Evidently modern.
   Oaks full-grown but very spreading
   and only c.20ft high. Dense und-
   erstorey of Rhodo. These groves
   are at 500ft alt. and 2 1/2 mi.
   from the sea. not on 1st ed OS.
   
   Hedges behind St Agnes. On the
   windswept plateau hedges are

[22172-22173]
often of furze, severely windpruned.
Oaks the commonest hedgerow trees
but max. often only 10ft or
less.
     Few elms in this area.
     
Save[????] Water, Baldhu, Bissoe Valley.
  Great tract of dense dispersed
settlement, small houses in many
lanes. Mostly appears to be
flourishing. Some houses said not
to have electricity.
  The medieval lanes and fields
are remarkably littel affected by
this development. The residual bits
of common seem to be now mostly
oakwood.
    Despite the high proportion
of former common in this area (see
1st ed. O.S.) much of the road
system is holloways with mixed
hedges having much hazel.
  Great excavations going on in
the valley bottom, perhaps for stream
tin.

Perranarworthal. The salt-marshes
are not covered at ordinary high
water.

Carclew. Extensive park plantations
of beech and old conifers.

Restronguet Wood. Destroyed
before 1st ed.O.S.
A: small closes behind houses -
most houses are modern.
B: great lynchetted bank with
big oaks- could be old woodbank.
C: narrow winding holloway with

[22174-22175]
[DIAG]
old mixed
hedges
D-D: lane straight,
unusually wide;
N-E hedge mixed, a
substantial not quite
straight bank,
much hazel; S.W.
hedge on slighter bank
and with few spp.
Restronguet Barton: ancient
farm.

E: very steep narrow holloway with
mixed hedges.

Quendon Park. Large deer-park
of grassland with scattered trees;
These include a very few ancient
oaks (prob. not pollard).
20-30 fallow deer of "normal"

[22176-22177]
colouring. Not particularly shy;
they can be approached to c. 50yds.
Fence is of about 10 plain wires
with dropperss, 6ft high. Stakes are
of galvanized angle-iron. Corners
not especially massive.
Quendon hall is an apparently
17th-cent. house. Interior is all
Victorian or later, decorated in the
most execrable taste - said to have
been rebuilt after a fire. Large num-
ber of secondary houses and out-
buildings, some prob. 17th cent.

Exceptionally cold night.
Magnificent hoarfrost of
needle-sharp ice crystals about

great trees in Leckhampton and
on the fen are white up to their
tops. Much snow remains in trees.
Hoarfrost also on buildings and
on the ground (esp. p[????])
Magnificent pale-blue sunny
day in Cambridge and the S.
fens, but fog from Waterbeach

The Bishop's mill-pool is frozen,
with ice that bears ducks right 
across.
No snow N. of Mar[????] but ground
white with hoarfrost.
Ouse Washes not more flooded

portico. the great stable courtyard,

Thinly scattered oaks and

than the house.
Ancient trees. A few old pollard &
other oaks S.W. of the stables, and
others in the W. of the park by the
Severn.
Deer. Said to be fallow, but not
seen. Escapes are said to have
