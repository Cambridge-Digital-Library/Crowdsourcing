Devonport Leat. A
well-constructed channel
about 6ft wide with
fast-flowing water. Said to be
18th-cent.

Welltown water-works. A powerful
spring is diverted by a number 
of leats and made to fill a s[????]
trough in the yard. In the dairy
of the house it was led in a
shallow watercourse round the
room for cooling vessels of milk.

Fine view from the triangle of
moor between Horseyeatt and Egg-
worthy. Walkham Valley with
King's, Staple, and Pew Tors. Exten-
sive woods apparently mainly of
oak. Brent Tor in the distance.
[22170-22171]
20 Nov. cont. from p.2150.
Oaks. In this area both spp.
occur; petraea is predominant
even in hedges. Petraea is very
variable and often of spreading habit.
Seems to be little doubt about
species. They probably cannot be
told apart at a distance.
Valley-bottom woods. Frequent in
Kenwyn valley, prob. recent.
Patchy structure but sometimes cop-
piced.Sallow usually dom. but
much hazel. Alder infrequent.
Weather exceedingly warm,
damp, with some drizzle.

   Lecture to 
Cornwall Naturalists' Trust.
   Opera Eugene Onegin at
   Falmouth.
   Granite. Not much used in
   building at Truro except for
   pretentious buildings of 19th &
   20th cent. A paving material is
   long granite slabs (perhaps
   of a standarized size intended
   mainly for lintels).
   
   22 Nov. cont from p. 2155.
   Groves in St Agnes, 729483 and
   734478. Evidently modern.
   Oaks full-grown but very spreading
   and only c.20ft high. Dense und-
   erstorey of Rhodo. These groves
   are at 500ft alt. and 2 1/2 mi.
   from the sea. not on 1st ed OS.
   
   Hedges behind St Agnes. On the
   windswept plateau hedges are

[22172-22173]
often of furze, severely windpruned.
Oaks the commonest hedgerow trees
but max. often only 10ft or
less.
     Few elms in this area.
     
Save[????] Water, Baldhu, Bissoe Valley.
  Great tract of dense dispersed
settlement, small houses in many
lanes. Mostly appears to be
flourishing. Some houses said not
to have electricity.
  The medieval lanes and fields
are remarkably littel affected by
this development. The residual bits
of common seem to be now mostly
oakwood.
    Despite the high proportion
of former common in this area (see
1st ed. O.S.) much of the road
system is holloways with mixed
hedges having much hazel.
  Great excavations going on in
the valley bottom, perhaps for stream
tin.

Perranarworthal. The salt-marshes
are not covered at ordinary high
water.

Carclew. Extensive park plantations
of beech and old conifers.

Restronguet Wood. Destroyed
before 1st ed.O.S.
A: small closes behind houses -
most houses are modern.
B: great lynchetted bank with
big oaks- could be old woodbank.
C: narrow winding holloway with

[22174-22175]
[DIAG]
old mixed
hedges
D-D: lane straight,
unusually wide;
N-E hedge mixed, a
substantial not quite
straight bank,
much hazel; S.W.
hedge on slighter bank
and with few spp.
Restronguet Barton: ancient
farm.

E: very steep narrow holloway with
mixed hedges.

27 Nov. PAYNSDEN WOOD.
Quendon Park. Large deer-park
of grassland with scattered trees;
These include a very few ancient
oaks (prob. not pollard).
20-30 fallow deer of "normal"

[22176-22177]
colouring. Not particularly shy;
they can be approached to c. 50yds.
Fence is of about 10 plain wires
with dropperss, 6ft high. Stakes are
of galvanized angle-iron. Corners
not especially massive.
Quendon hall is an apparently
17th-cent. house. Interior is all
Victorian or later, decorated in the
most execrable taste - said to have
been rebuilt after a fire. Large num-
ber of secondary houses and out-
buildings, some prob. 17th cent.

Attingham Park
National Trust. A large park
The house is a vast Palladian
mansion of c. 1800, with 3-storyed
portico. the great stable courtyard,
is distant from the house, used
as the Midland headquarters 
of the Nature Conservancy.
Thinly scattered oaks and
other trees, many spreading and
very large.but unlikely to be older
than the house.
Ancient trees. A few old pollard &
other oaks S.W. of the stables, and
others in the W. of the park by the
Severn.
Deer. Said to be fallow, but not
seen. Escapes are said to have
colonized the neighbourhood.
Park pale. Abojut 1/2 mile of pale
along the road. The greater part
old (though with some pales
replaced by new cleft ones).
Morticed posts with 2 rails;
pales of rather roughly cleft oak,
about 4" wide and 4" apart,
alternating long & short
[!!!!]pointed. About 4ft high.
There is a stretch of newer
pale of similar construction but a
little higher and the joints nailed
rather than pegged.

Leighton. Many woods, mostly Victorian
plantations: hybrid limes and conifers.
Fine view of meanders of the Severn.
Devil's Dingle, Buil[????]. Filled in and
gone.
[22182-22183]

way to Cambridge. No wind or
drifting.
Most A and B roads covered but
passable with difficulty and occas-
ional delays.
Light snow continued all day.
At Wellington station trains were
running 3/4 - 1 hour late. Said to be

laden with snow.
Acer orientale- Leaves now
falling.
The lake in the Botanic Gar-
dens is thickly frozen.
Small adults skating on the
Mill Pool and the backwater
across Sheep's Green; passing
under a wooden bridge.
[22184-22185]
In evening weather got
very rough indeed. Strong S.E. 
wind breaking small twigs off trees.
Fine driving snow, well below freezing.
Nearly white-out at times. Quite
difficult to get into college from
Leckhampton. Snow impacted on
vertical surfaces, e.g. old brick-
work of Queens' College. Streets
almost deserted.
14 Dec.
Freezing all day, save for a few hours.
River now frozen all along
the Backs. Ice extends under
Clare & Trinity bridges. Small
pool under Garret Hostel Bridge,
where dux congregate. Anchor
pool also largely frozen.
Sunny day with melting on
N-facing roofs. Strong leak in
N-facing valley roof sending water
through two floors of Old Leck-
hampton House.
15 Dec.
Dull day of continuous frost.
Roads dangerously icy, esp. Burrell's
Walk and lane up to Leckhampton,
which are polished ice.
16 Dec.
River has risen and much of
the ice is gone. Backs mostly
clear. Ice appears to be melted
from below, not broken up. Still
solidly frozen by Midsummer 
Common. 
Much soil and grass now ex-
posed on Midsummer Common &
the Fens.
[!!!!] Visit to
64 Harvey Lane, Norwich.

[22186-22187]
Garden covered in snow;
drift about 1ft deep on lawn. The
heating has worked satisfactorily
and there has been no trouble
from frost.
The We[????] has a film
of ice.
17 Dec.
Very cold night; ice inside my
bedroom window behind the shutters.
(Ice also on morning of 14 Dec.,
thick on bedroom & keeping-room
behind shutters, some even on
bathroom which has no shutters;
this one of the coldest nights of the
century.)
The Backs stayed partly frozen
and ice is now getting thick again.
Writing accounts of declining
animals.
18 Dec.
Another very cold clear night.
Ice inside shuttered bedroom &
sittingroom windows. (Minimum
temperature so far inside bed-
room is 53oF.)
Snow is very slowly melting
from beneath, but cover remains
general.
Only the main roads are clear
of snow; all lesser streets around
Leckhampton & the University Lib-
rary are compacted into rivers of ice.
Burrell's Walk is specially dangerous.
History of prices of rabbits; 
continue chapter on changes in
fauna.
19 Dec.       BS DR 3.10
Ice inside bedroom shutters
again. Ice on river is extending &

[22188-22189]
getting thicker.
People yesterday were walking
and skating on Bishop's mill-pool,
but not many as yet.
Great Waldingfield was inac-
cessible 13 to 17 Dec. - holloways
filled.
Snow cover now rather patchy on
fields S. of Cambridge. Around
Great Dunmow prob. about 6 in. onal
level, but much drifting. Stane
Street is clear but reduced in
width. Lanes around Stebbing were
impassable for 2-3 days. Now
partly clear, but narrow, with banks
of snow up to 7ft. high at roadsides.
Snow in fields appears to reveal
extensive pattern of stripes &
polygons in many parts of Stebbing.
A good example is on the E-facing
slope N.E. of Bran End. (The name
Bran End is alleged to be from
"burnt end"; a local farmer de-
scribes it as "hot land", liable to
produce parched patterns on
crops in a dry summer.) No sign
of the Stebbing Green villa.
Snow around Boxted Wood is
piled into shallow drifts. Melting
& freezing has formed a crust
usually just strong enough to 
walk on.
Saling Elm. In the junction of
roads at the middle of the village
of Great Saling. A huge elm,
forking about 8ft up into three
giant limbs, probably a very old 
pollard. About a year ago lopt
to some 25ft high. Bolling is c.

[22190-22191]
8ft thick. Said to have been
topped during World War II "to
prevent the Americans from flying
into it". Described as "the biggest
smooth-leaved elm in England";
but an early photo shows it to
have the broad forking habit of
Boxted Elm. Regrowth after lopping
weak but apparently healthy.
Has been injected once.

Stebbing Mount. Tall acute motte
near valley bottom.

Hares. About 20, and 1 rabbit,
seen around Boxted Wood.

BOXTED WOOD, STEBBING

Beautiful almost cloudless 
day. River at Cambridge is frozen
all along the Backs and under
most bridges including Queens'. Ice
shows curious linear striations,
often intersecting each other, as if
skated upon, even where it is thin.

20 Dec.
Little St Mary's; St Edwards;
writing to Jenny & others.
Slight thaw; some snowfall.
21 Dec.

ter on flora & fauna.
Slight snowfall most of the day;

Maps and references in University
Library.

[22192-22193]
Clear day of hard frost.
Went to Coton by the footpath.
Drifts of snow all the way from the
New Cavendish to the motorway
bridge. About 3ft thick, almost
N.-S. ridges, on both sides of the rather 
thin hedge. Chainlink fence also
causes drifting but to a lesser
extent. After several days freezing
& thawing the crust is strong enough
to be walked on in most places,
but cycling is impossible because
surface too uneven, & dragging a
cycle quite difficult. Lane W. of
motorway has thick high hedges
and no drifts. Presumably formed
on 13 Dec.
23 Dec.
More maps in University Library.
Freezing fog with good hoarfrost.
Much ice on river has melted.
Most roads in W. Cambridge
are rivers of polished ice and
very slippery.
Road surfaces where exposed
are much cracked and broken
up.
Some rabbit tracks in Leck-
hampton.
24 Dec.
Freezing fog in Cambridge in
morning.
River Ouse mainly frozen at
Ely. Swans walking on ice.
Boats frozen into yacht basin.

in icy field N.E. of Ely.
Said to have been skating on
Kings' Backs on 21 Dec.
Gulls have been on the Backs.

[22194-22195]
2 swans flying ghost-like thro'
the white landscape of the N.E.Fens.
Some ice at the edges of the
tidal Yare near Thorpe station.
At Thorpe the arm of the Yare
is iced right across. Also several
tidal backwaters at Brundall
and Strumpshaw Dyke.
About 6" of level snow in Cam-
bridge. Almost as much in Norwich.
E. of Blofield the snow gets thinner.
Continuous snow as far E. as
about the Stracey Arms. Only
patches of snow remain in Yar-
mouth; they diminish rapidly
towards the coast.
Only small patches of trodden
snow remain around Youell 
Avenue.
Went to Midnight Mass at
St Mary Magdalene, Gorleston. There
had been heavy rain at Youell
Avenue in the late afternoon.
The church is about 1/2 mile inland.
Quite extensive snow around it,
severe frost at night; roads etc.
much glazed with frozen rain.
The increase of snow inland
is remarkable.
25 Dec.       38 YOUELL AVENUE
Snow little   GORLESTON
altered since
yesterday. Continuous snow
from the Stracey Arms along
the A[????] New Road to Nor-
ich; there have been quite deep
drifts of old snow around
Blofield, and many minor roads
are covered. 
Snow covers the garden of 64

[22196-22197]
Harvey Lane. Little remains on
the roof.
At Lincoln Street the side-
-walks are covered with thick
trodden snow, glazed and slippery.
Snow has been sliding off roots
but is now frozen on.
Brilliant day of hoarfrost
and intense cold. Fog towards
evening - the foghorn went
much of the night.
The great elm of Acle stands
in a small triangular green.
About 3ft diam., prob. a rather high
pollard. Apparently dead some
years - has lost much of its bark
26 Dec.
Gray day with biting wind from
S.S.E. and quite rough brown
chilly sea eating at the beach.
Sea-wall at Gorleston is still
apparently stable, but large cracks
in the concrete are crumbling at 
edges. In two places piles of
rox and earth have been dumped
against it, possibly as protection
for weak spots. Each pile is
about 30ft x 30ft x 20ft square, with
rough rocks up to c. 3ft across
packed in the middle with sand &
earth evidently from the same 
source as the rocks. Rocks are of
some dark greeny-black meta-
morphic stone, crystalline structure,
possibly hornblende-schist; with
veins of quartzite and others yellow
and red.
Alongside the golf-course are
crumbling cliffs of sand with
some clay. Occasional sand-martins'
[22198-22199]
nests in the sand faces. Much
stratification in the sand.
Humic root channels occur in the
upper layers, rather few, mostly black,
the deepest extending about 4ft.
Lupin occurs in the more
stable parts of Hopton cliff.
Frost has blackened the
leaves of Hypochaeris and other
rosette plants in clifftop turf. Some
damage to Plantago coronopus.
Lupin leaves much blackened.
27 Dec.
Snow for a short period in the
afternoon. Weather relatively warm;
remnants of ice s[????]y melt.
Biting wind from S.E.
Quite a rough sea. At the
evening high tide waves crash
every 10 sec. or so into the new
[DIAG]
sea-wall, sending spray up higher
than the top of the cliff, and carrying
sand and large shingle onto the road.
At each impact there is a loud
bang, which can be heard well
inland, and an earth tremor can
be felt on the clifftop. Only a few
of the street lights in the road remain
intact. Waves break clean over
the short pier projecting S. from the
S. pier of Yarmouth Harbour.
28 Dec.
Relatively warm. Cliff vegeta-
[22200-22201]
tion (Agropyron juncei. Ac) is mar-
kedly yellow where soaked in
spray.
Concrete of sea-wall is much
cracked. Apron has cracks every
few feet, which are eroding at the
edges.
Remnants of snow on Breydon
marshes, dykes solidly frozen. Snow
rapidly increases westwards and
is still continuous W. of about 1 mi.
E. of Acle.

was built. Said by the owner to
have had a moat, most of which
[22204-22205]
is now covered in.
Plumpton has several fields
of old grassland rich in Anthoxan-
thum, with dozens of great pollard
oaks. These amount to a [SYMBOL]-
