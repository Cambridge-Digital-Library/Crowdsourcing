Devonport Leat. A
well-constructed channel
about 6ft wide with
fast-flowing water. Said to be
18th-cent.

Welltown water-works. A powerful
spring is diverted by a number 
of leats and made to fill a s????
trough in the yard. In the dairy
of the house it was led in a
shallow watercourse round the
room for cooling vessels of milk.

Fine view from the triangle of
moor between Horseyeatt and Egg-
worthy. Walkham Valley with
King's, Staple, and Pew Tors. Exten-
sive woods apparently mainly of
oak. Brent Tor in the distance.
[22170-22171]
20 Nov. cont. from p.2150.
Oaks. In this area both spp.
occur; petraea is predominant
even in hedges. Petraea is very
variable and often of spreading habit.
Seems to be little doubt about
species. They probably cannot be
told apart at a distance.
Valley-bottom woods. Frequent in
Kenwyn valley, prob. recent.
Patchy structure but sometimes cop-
piced.Sallow usually dom. but
much hazel. Alder infrequent.
Weather exceedingly warm,
damp, with some drizzle.

Cornwall Naturalists' Trust.
   Opera Eugene Onegin at
   Falmouth.
   Granite. Not much used in
   building at Truro except for
   pretentious buildings of 19th &
   20th cent. A paving material is
   long granite slabs (perhaps
   of a standarized size intended
   mainly for lintels).
