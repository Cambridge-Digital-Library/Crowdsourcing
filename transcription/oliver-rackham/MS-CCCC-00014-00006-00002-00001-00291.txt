10 April cont. [SYMBOL]
Cypress Invasions, Trees of various
ages thickly scattered over olive &
carob land. They run from [SYMBOL] 
[SYMBOL] to between [SYMBOL] and
[SYMBOL].

[DIAG]
Largest cypresses c. 1 ft dia. Ex-
cept in the thickest areas (by the
new main road) they do not occupy
all the ground but leave some
[22578-22579]
2578
cultivated trees & grassland.
   Cypreswes are genetically variable.
Upright trunk with short horizon-
tsl branches, no sign of fastigiateness.
   These cypresses fill the view
from [SYMBOL] and are the chief
difference  now dyscernible on Lear's
view of Psiloviti.

Quercus pubescens. Occ,  at [SYMBOL]

[SYMBOL] [SYMBOL] Broad lime-
stone gorge to N.W.of village, Not much
of it inaccessible to grazing. Not
narrow enough to be very shaded.
The road passes through a quarry.
One of the best inland sites for Euphor-
bia dendroides.
   Looks like hard limestone, but not
shown as such on geological map.
2579
   To S.W. towards Rhamni the
roadside rocks are conglomerates, with
springs in places. This area appears
to be relatively damp, but tree
growth restricted by severe grazing.

[SYMBPOL] Unusually scattered village,
with big trees of prickly-oak and
cypress between the houses.
   In valley bottom a pleasant
river and springs with huge plane
trees.
   No vertical cypresses!

[SYMBOL] The great cyress of p.2576 is
by the ancient chapel of St George.
Edward Lear's view of Psiloritip
can easily be identified. The middle
ground is now occupied vy hundreds
of cyprsses not those in 1864.
[22580-22581]
2580
Foreground rather stony, heavily
grazed steppe and macchia. Stone
field-walks.

Weather. Warm and sunny. Mist
and lowbcloud at [SYMBOL].

Oranges. Upper limit about 100 m.
Now near the end of the season.
The usual Cretan orange has 2-3
tiers of carpels.
2581
11 AQril.
   Way up to Omalos.
Cherry in small ravine 1 km short
of [SYMBOL] turn.
   White Cistus ab. in flower.
Qp begins at [SYMBOL] turn,

Lavender freq on phyllite up to
[SYMBOL].

Soil sample: olive grove,
phyllite terrace 1 km. short of
[SYMBOL].

Chesnuts. Small grove at [SYMBOL].

Terraces. Very extensive 
around & above [SYMBOL]
on limestone. Only a few are still
[22582-22583]
2582
cultivated, save on phyllite.

Trevor Battye picture "Homalo"
Neaqrer hikkside to right is ll
Qc, mostly still topiary but
with some advanced leaders.
Biggest is c. 12 ft high, with
severasl trunks up to 6" thick. [SYMBOL] 35,                                        36
   Exact site of picture can be as-
certained to c. 3 ft each way. It is
in the middle of the modern road.
In the distance the cypresses can
be seen to be bigger since T-B.
"House of a cLakkiot in Homalo" Spot
identifiable with certainty, by small farm
004382. Building shown by T.-B. has gone
completely. There is another nearby, of the
same massive construction with
immense quoins, but differences of
detail show that it cannot be the same

People gspathering [SYMBOL]
(dandelions) and spring lettuce
[SYMBOL] for [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] is ordinarily applied
to cultivated lettuce. [SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL] means any hedgehog-plant;
here used of Cichorium spinosum.
Both are dug up along the
Omalos roadside, using a small
hoe or a long knife. People come
in cars for the purpose. we
had some Cichotium spinsum
which is fioo, with a mildly
bitter flavour like endive
This near kast year's Zelkora site.
Ranunculus ficaria ssp calthi-
folius. A similar formin cabun-
dant in pans on the Omalos Plain.
Achenes glabrous at flowering.
