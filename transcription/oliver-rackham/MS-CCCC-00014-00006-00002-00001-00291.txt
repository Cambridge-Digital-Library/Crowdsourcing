10 April cont. [SYMBOL]
Cypress Invasions, Trees of various
ages thickly scattered over olive &
carob land. They run from [SYMBOL] 
[SYMBOL] to between [SYMBOL] and
[SYMBOL].

[DIAG]
Largest cypresses c. 1 ft dia. Ex-
cept in the thickest areas (by the
new main road) they do not occupy
all the ground but leave some
[22578-22579]
2578
cultivated trees & grassland.
   Cypreswes are genetically variable.
Upright trunk with short horizon-
tsl branches, no sign of fastigiateness.
   These cypresses fill the view
from [SYMBOL] and are the chief
difference  now dyscernible on Lear's
view of Psiloviti.

Quercus pubescens. Occ,  at [SYMBOL]

[SYMBOL] [SYMBOL] Broad lime-
stone gorge to N.W.of village, Not much
of it inaccessible to grazing. Not
narrow enough to be very shaded.
The road passes through a quarry.
One of the best inland sites for Euphor-
bia dendroides.
   Looks like hard limestone, but not
shown as such on geological map.
2579
   To S.W. towards Rhamni the
roadside rocks are conglomerates, with
springs in places. This area appears
to be relatively damp, but tree
growth restricted by severe grazing.

[SYMBPOL] Unusually scattered village,
with big trees of prickly-oak and
cypress between the houses.
   In valley bottom a pleasant
river and springs with huge plane
trees.
   No vertical cypresses!

[SYMBOL] The great cyress of p.2576 is
by the ancient chapel of St George.
Edward Lear's view of Psiloritip
can easily be identified. The middle
ground is now occupied vy hundreds
of cyprsses not those in 1864.
[22580-22581]
2580
Foreground rather stony, heavily
grazed steppe and macchia. Stone
field-walks.

Weather. Warm and sunny. Mist
and lowbcloud at [SYMBOL].

Oranges. Upper limit about 100 m.
Now near the end of the season.
The usual Cretan orange has 2-3
tiers of carpels.

Cherry in small ravine 1 km short

Soil sample: olive grove,

Terraces. Very extensive

Maple gets up to the spring.
Berberis cretica.
  Spring flowing strongly. Mountains
around are about half covered in
snow. Melting all around, with the
noise of countless streams.
  Few plants yet in flower, save Chio-
noxia cretica which gets nearly up
to the spring.
   We crossed deep snow in several
places from 1200 m upwards, The
lowest patches are [!!!!] c. 1000 m.
Small remains of avalanchee. Gulley

lanche sire and is already exposed to sun.
Some of the screes are active: a
large rock fell while we were there.
But on the whole, few rox have
fallen onto the snow.

[22590-22591]
2590
Aspect predominantly N.
Soil appears to be unusually fer-
tile. Trees surrounded by a grove
of bitten-down Zelkova, about 10 ac.
in all, running down the E. slope
a little way but then replaced by
maple. Maple is generally dom. on
the surrounding hlllside, which is
more rocky thsn the Zelkova area.
No cypress below 1300 m. on
this dide of the valley.
   Zelkova flowers at about 15 ft
high.
   A acene of stunning beauty: the
great pollards, looking like several
different East Anglian elms, over
a carpet of Chionodoxa.
   Zelkova is not spiny but forms a
curiously hard dense topiary.
Ruined mandra hut with some
Zelkova poles among its roof timbers.
2591
Evernia furfuracea
Not abundant, but occurs on
Q. coccifera, maple, Juniperus
oxycedrus, and Xelkova, 1050-

eaten down to topiary c. 2 ft high.

Anemone coronaria. Omalos Plain,

Lakkiot Houses. The thick walls of
the T-B house and of the surviving
one have a xurious offset in the
lower part. Roof-water drains
into the wall-thickness. No trace
could be found of the house in the

Peninsula.

Grambousa is a high thin moun-
tsin, specially thin when seen from
the N. end, with tremendous cliffs to
the W, and two rows of less
steep cliffs to the E.
A road runs to sbout 1 km S. of
Kakiskala; from here a rough but
well-marked path leads to the isth-
mus by Tigani.
   Whole peninsula is heavily grazed
with few trees, none of them big.
Kakiskala, The path crosses a con-
sidersable but broken area of cliffs,
parts of them inaccessible. A few
shallow acaves. Path in this area is
constructed, with retaining walls.

Pharangi. The deepest of the
many shallow ravines on this side.
Some cliffs higher in its course. Mac-
chia more continuous rhan else-
where.
[SYMBOL] About 3/4 km S,. of the

side the path. J. says i is perennial.
Beautiful cool water.
  A wellhead structure is formed
of Marly limestone in the form of a
2-centred arch. Where not protec-
ted by mortar the stones are deeply
eroded. There is a spout df stone,
now bypassed by the water. Decora-
tive motif {DIAG] shallowly incised

Tigani. Steep rocky island with cliffs.
Its connexioin with the island is
strangely different from that shown
on the maps. The marsh "Balos" no
longer exists. The sand-spit A has
been broken through by a channel
C, several feet deep; and in place 
of the march is a lagoon.  D is a
ledge of beach-rock, much ereoded
into pools, and in the middle is 
quite broken through by a channel
2615
c. 4 ft wide   [DIAG]
which has to
be leapt. Part
of the lagoon, B,
is full of sand.
We made our way
across this and found it to be thix-
otropic. I was leading the way &
warned that the ground was soft;
had to retreat.
   This sand is composed largely of
shells and pink coral. The latter is
separated by sedimentatii=on, forming
pink stripes st the water-line.
   Shells include a cowrie.
Chapel of St George is surrounded
by Roman pottery and is evidentky ad-
apted from a Roman building. Possible
inscriptions.
   The whole  bay is defiled with great
