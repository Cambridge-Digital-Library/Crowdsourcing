Occurrence of Hornbeam.
IN the N. part of compart-
ment 3 along the ride. A
nearly pure stand of stools c.
4ft dia. Little ground vege-
tation. Poles up to c. 4 in.
dia. Sporadic cutting has
been done this winter; the
last felling was in 1950-52,
and the poles all appear to 
date from then.
[!!!!]N.E. of[!!!!]Around the 2376 cross-roads,
occurs in mixed coppice and
as a single small standard
at the cross-roads.
The first0mentioned block
has a number of large
straight ditches running thro'
it (not plotted). The stools

[14250-14251]          

4250

along the ride are in a fair-
ly straight line (pointed out
by Trist) but there appears 
to be no other regularity.
A few saplings in the S.E.
[????] of compartment 6.
Scattered groups of stools
[????] the east ride; few standards.
The very large trees (p.
3274-[????] in comp. 8.
A considerable tract
of stools around the chain
of ponds in comp. 3, apparently
continuous with those in the
N. of this compartment. To
the S. it abuts on oak-birch
woodland.
An area in the middle
of comp. 12, in what appears

4251

from its earthworks to be
a former wood-close. Rather
large stools, extending slightly
out of the area to the N.
and S. In the W. of the
area overlapping with elm cop-
pice.
Hornbeam seldom [????]
duces. Stools mainly in [????]
stands but those of compt 3
tend to be scattered and
mixed with other coppice.

Elms.
Probably taxonomically
complex. The N.E. populations
are mainly non-suckering, probably 
U. glabra mixed with vegeta
and possibly other species.

[14252-14253]

4252

stools to c. 5ft dia. but
many smaller, except round the
multiple pits. * At the N. end
of Middle Ride is a curious 
elm looking like T. cordata
in habit and with similar
bark. None of these elms
occurs as standards or suckers.
The other elms appear
to be normal suckering clones;
one of these occurs in the
northern hornbeam area.

Abutting boundaries.
Three hedges appear to 
[????] former wood mar-
gins.
THat at D is an elm
hedge which continues [????]
* Note age distribution (p. 4238).

4253

wood boundary. The field
on one side is nearly 3ft
higher than the other.
At the N.W. corner are
in the middle of the W.
side are two sinuous hedges
with a slope [DIAG]
up to them
on the
side of the field that lies
between, in the manner of
a plowed-down wood bank.
They are both chiefly black-
thorn with few other species.

North-east part of Compartment
12.
Certainly secondary wood-
land, probably originally of

[14254-14255]

4254

c. 1800 but with later plan-
ting.
Earthwork-bound, bank on
field side very weak.
3 boundary pollards, one
now in the wood (pollar-
ded when the wood was last
felled). In addition there is
a pollard about 5 yards in
[????] the field boundary.
Consists mainly of syca-
more & ash coppice, ap-
parently established as a
mixture, stools to c. 2ft (-2 1/2')
diam.; some once-cuts and 
promoted trees.
A number of dead spruces
and stumps, probably planted
c. 1850.

4255

Symphoricarpos thicket.
Fairly well-drained.
Carpinus slightly invades
where it abuts on the S.
Both Symphoricarpos and
sycamore slightly invade ad-
joining woodland on the E.

The area to the S. is 
probably also secondary wood-
land with an original wood
bank to its S. Much ear-
lier, with hornbeam in the
W. half and elm coppice
with the hornbeam at the
W. end.
Both E.-W. banks are
slightly sinuous.
The bank to the W. of

[14256-14257]

4256

the N. secondary woodland
area is much more massive
than the rest of this postu-
lated relic wood-bank:

North-west of Compartment 12.
An area of pits about 
5 ft deep (shape shown on p.
4238) with no correspon-
ding mounds. They correspond
to "black holes", i.e. without 
vegetation in the bottom
although now dry, but are
much steeper-sided than such 
features in other woods.
The largest ash stools of
this type (U. glabra?) occur
[!!!!]in these[!!!!] among these pits,
with a "halo" of rather

4257

smaller stools all round. It
is not clear how much of the
other elm in this area belong
to this species.

Western Boundaries.
D. to N.W. corner: [!!!!]very[!!!!]
slight acute bank (cf N.E.
boundary of FHW, W. boundary
of N. Elmham GW) in three
dead straight lengths nearly
in line. Hedged in the W.
part. The middle alignment
has a row of small stools
on the field side. Clearly
a recent trimming.
N. half of W. side: dead
straight, slight acute bank
on both sides of the ditch,

[14258-14259]

4258

regular hawthorn hedge on
wood side. Clearly another
truncation, especially in con-
junction with the remains
of wood-banks in the ad-
joining fields.
[????] half of W. side:
slightly sinuous, broad flat
[????] with 3 oak pollards
just outside. Transition
where ploughed-down wood
[????]adjoins. An ancient
boundary; probably rather
[????] in species than the 
N. boundary.
The S.W. indentation
has dead straight sides,
to the N. a slight bank
and a more substantial one

4259

to the E. Could be the
result of addition rather than
subtraction.

Ponds.
From about 10ft to 20
yards across, usually irregularly
round or elongated. Nearly
all steep-sided and probably
2-3 ft deep. No banks or
mounds.
Mostly of some age [????]
suggested shell-holes!) because
large stools grow in there
or on their edges.
Some appear to be ex-
tensions of ditches but others
have had ditches cut to
them.

[14260-14261]

4260

Mostly densely shaded
and lacking vegetation (Cx
riparia in the S.W. chain of
ponds).

Clearing in W. third.
Area clear-felled, apart
from some islands of untouched
woodland. Much burning
especially on stumps. Has
apparently gone on slowly for
c. 4 years.
Coppice regrowth very like
that at Hayley. Hazel
generally unsuccessful. Ash
variable and often unsuc-
cessful, though sometimes
reaching c. 8ft in 3 years.
Aspen abundant and in

4261

places forming pure thickets
by suckering. Hornbeam pro-
bably absent.
There is as in Hayley a
very dense stand of Juncus
mainly effusus. Not much
Filipendula or Cirsium palustre.
This part of the wood
appears to be a slight
basin.

South-west Ditch.
Broad, rather deep,
unbanked, nearly straight
with a curious dog-leg in
the middle. Chain of large
well-defined ponds.

South of this ditch is

[14262-14263]

4262

considerable tract of oak-birch
woodland.

Rides.
Very overgrown. Not ditched,
[????] some must be ancient
because they appear to de-
termine adjoining stools.
Numerous shallow rect-
angular pits beside rides
appear to have been used
for road material. Often
full of Glyceria fluitans.

Water.
Generally a very wet
wood. Most of the ponds
contain water. Mercury is
largely marginal.

4263

Oaks.
No large trees. Most of
the standards are small
and over-mature.
Exceptionally impressive
stool oaks, especially in the
N. part of the wood near
the acid area. Poles up to [????]
9 per stool, c. 50 ft high.
Maiden poles (c. 9 in. dia)
rather frequent.
Oak poles [!!!!]ofte[!!!!]usually
rather straight and resem-
ble medieval building tim-
bers.

[14264-14265]

4264

Features.
1. Typical hill-top site.
2. Tri-parochial: exac boun-
daries uncertain.
3. Marginal bank typical
where original, but remains
marginal only on the S. and
part of the W. S.W. and
N.W. are truncated; E. and
rest of N. have a complex
history probably involving
addition and subtraction.
4. Internal earthworks of
unprecedented complexity, in-
cluding:
(i) At least 26 ponds perhaps
of at least 3 types (shoal,
round isolated, elongated).
(ii) Broad N.E. bank probably

4265

the old St Edmund's boundary.
(iii) Other broad banks perhaps
old wood-banks.
(iiii) Broad relatively straight
ditches.
(v) Slight meandering ditches.
5. Few boundary pollards.
6. Very large assemblage of
trees & shrubs including
hornbeam, holly, cherry, and
marginal Daphne.
7. Few exotics correlated with 
sec. woodland.
8. Poor coppice structure
with large standards gone.
Only dense coppice is horn-
beam. Large stools of other
species present but very few
[????]9. Light and heavy wood-

[14266-14267]

4266

land types as in Huntlesham
and Ramsey, but generally
wetter and more calcareous.
Bracken very rare.
9. Primrose present but not
[????]
10. Elm situation complex,
with:
(i) Corner patches, one at a 
recent corner.
(ii) Suckering elm in old
2ndary woodland.
(iii) Area of U. glabra stools
with big ones in the middle
diminishing outwards, sug-
gesting a new type of elm
invasion.
11. Hornbeam excellent;
standard trees and tracts

4267

forming a mosaic. If this started in sec. woodland it
has spread beyond it.
12. Oak regeneration good
until c. 1950. Oak coppice
second only to Swanton [????]
13. Daphne in old margin.
14. Cherry probably all mar
ginal.
15. Poplar behaves much as
in Hayley and is unusually
frequent for Suffolk.
16. No Allium.
17. Apparently no original rides.

[14268-14269]

4268

A documentarily ancient
wood and probably partly pri-
mary. Mercury, Crataegus oxy;
Luzula pilosa, Paris; but Daph-
ne (marginal).
N.E. part perhaps very old
secondary.
19th-cent. trimming of N. &
[????]S.W. clearing probably 18th
[????].
A N. part of compt 12 is pro-
bably late 18th cent. secondary.
Area S. of this older secondary;
probably [!!!!]other[!!!!] at least one
area of old secondary near
the middle of the wood. Horn-
beam partly associated with
these areas.
Earliest features are the

4269

larger ditches and the ponds.
Straight ditches [SYMBOL]are of uncertain
date but later than ponds;
meandering ditches [SYMBOL]are partly
natural watercourses and
partly an attempt to drain
the wood. Ditch system [????]
later than ponds because
branch ditches are [????]
to most of the ponds [????]
exceedingly irregular layout
suggests a half-hearted at-
tempt to make the best of
existing features. The rides
(some of which appear to de-
termine the positions of
sizeable hornbeam stools) are
laid out regardless of ditches
and ponds and are clearly

[14270-14271]

4270

later than either.
A final opinion on the
wood depends on the inter-
pretation of the ponds, which
could be natural depressions
of the black-hole kind. They
are much deeper than such
features in other woods,
and "normal" black-holes are
rare.

Coppicing abandoned before
1870. Drastic felling, including
standards, on several occa-
sions this century.

Oxlips flowering well in

centration on sloping ground
on both sides of the beck

Not significantly eaten here
but [????]ch in other parts.
Damage mostly by cropping
the tips [????] 
The two [SYMBOL]dead or dying oaks
are much decayed but might 
contain dating material.
Wood generally dry. No
surface water seen, even in
ditches.
Much evidence of shoo-
ting. No apparent felling on
[????]g[????]t since last visit

4285

Note that I probably repre-
sents the head of a natu-
ral stream. It appears to
end quite suddently. No evi-
dence of a spring.
The "common lane" was
seen in its northern branch
near B, p. 4278. Rather
shallower and less distinct
than the E. branch. Its
banks apparently not trace-
able beyond Free Wood.

Dry rot in the skirting
board of my bathroom

verted from a coal bunker
c. 1963. Board on internal

reduced to a shell of sound
wood under the paint.

April 18.
The medieval outside door
