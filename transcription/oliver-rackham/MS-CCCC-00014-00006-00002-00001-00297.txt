          Potto
Hedges. Variable,  most seem to
be semi-mixed, in accordance 
with the inclosure of the parish,
prob. in the early 17th cent. Ridge-

Heaton Hill in Potto. row of 5-6
great elms - they have the charac-
teristics of a low forking Ug, but
may sucker v. slightly, and are
said to have smallish leaves. Pen-
dulous twigs. One dead of unknown
cause.
-------------------------------------
-&-furrow just discernible in some
fields. Hedges mostly approx straight -
not forming a regular grid.
  Blackthorn is the commonest
hedge plant. Hazel freq. Dogwood
in only one place.
3113
Pig-sticking. Bill Cowley has
stuck pigs in India. You ride
around the jungle looking for wild
boar and with luck you find some.
You ride after them snd spear
them from behind. The spear
has a triangular point and no
crossbar.

Bracken. He and a friend were
given brscken shoots (the curled
tips of the young fronds) in India
where they are regarded as a delicacy.
They were both violently ill.
He says cattle & sheep eat bra-
cken and are poisoned by it un-
less only a very little is eaten.

alder & ash, many recently felled.

G: holloway, with much hazel in sin-
uous hedges.
 Jet Mines. At around the 500 ft con-
 tour are many small adits for jet
 (19th cent.). Easily recognised by the
 spoil-heaps of shale. Large quantities
 of rock had to be searched for jet,
 which occurred as scattered logs. The
 shale is oily and has invariably
 been burnt, giving a charsacteristic
 red residue (used as road-metal).

Agriculture Bilsdale is relatively
wide. Mainly improved grassland; about

   Boundary of moor and fields is
much as on O.S. Mr Proudman
says that bracken has much increased
of late at the expense of meadow 
& pasture. Yhere is, howeveer, a rela-
tively new tract of green fields on 
the middle altitude of the S. end
of Nab Ridge.
