with the inclosure of the parish,
prob. in the early 17th cent. Ridge-

great elms - they have the charac-

may sucker v. slightly, and are
said to have smallish leaves. Pen-
dulous twigs. One dead of unknown

-------------------------------------
-&-furrow just discernible in some
fields. Hedges mostly approx straight -
not forming a regular grid.

in only one place.

Pig-sticking. Bill Cowley has
stuck pigs in India. You ride

boar and with luck you find some.
You ride after them snd spear
them from behind. The spear

crossbar.

Bracken. He and a friend were
given brscken shoots (the curled
tips of the young fronds) in India
where they are regarded as a delicacy.
They were both violently ill.

cken and are poisoned by it un-
less only a very little is eaten.

predominantly blackthorn. Has
dogwood, unfamiliar to he Cowleys.

 Jet Mines. At around the 500 ft con-
 tour are many small adits for jet
 (19th cent.). Easily recognised by the
 spoil-heaps of shale. Large quantities
 of rock had to be searched for jet,
 which occurred as scattered logs. The
 shale is oily and has invariably
 been burnt, giving a charsacteristic
 red residue (used as road-metal).
