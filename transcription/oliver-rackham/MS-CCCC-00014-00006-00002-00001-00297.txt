said to have smallish leaves. Pen-
dulous twigs. One dead of unknown
cause.
-------------------------------------
-&-furrow just discernible in some
fields. Hedges mostly approx straight -
not forming a regular grid.
  Blackthorn is the commonest
hedge plant. Hazel freq. Dogwood
in only one place.
3113
Pig-sticking. Bill Cowley has
stuck pigs in India. You ride
around the jungle looking for wild
boar and with luck you find some.
You ride after them snd spear
them from behind. The spear
has a triangular point and no
crossbar.

Bracken. He and a friend were
given brscken shoots (the curled
tips of the young fronds) in India
where they are regarded as a delicacy.
They were both violently ill.
He says cattle & sheep eat bra-
cken and are poisoned by it un-
less only a very little is eaten.

predominantly blackthorn. Has
dogwood, unfamiliar to he Cowleys.
F: boundary stone with 17th- or 18th -
century inscription.
G: holloway, with much hazel in sin-
uous hedges.
 Jet Mines. At around the 500 ft con-
 tour are many small adits for jet
 (19th cent.). Easily recognised by the
 spoil-heaps of shale. Large quantities
 of rock had to be searched for jet,
 which occurred as scattered logs. The
 shale is oily and has invariably
 been burnt, giving a charsacteristic
 red residue (used as road-metal).

Urra. Ancient village just below
limit of cultivation. Houses of sawn
sandstone. Many small farms. Trees
of beech, Scots, sycamore, ash; all
growing well.
Beeches grow very well aorund the
(Victorian) church of Bilsdale Midcable.
3123
Snow. Small patches high on the
W.side of Bilsdale.


Willicum Beck. Dpcumented as a
farm to the 14th cent.

Agriculture Bilsdale is relatively
wide. Mainly improved grassland; about
3% is under the plow.
   Boundary of moor and fields is
much as on O.S. Mr Proudman
says that bracken has much increased
of late at the expense of meadow 
& pasture. Yhere is, howeveer, a rela-
tively new tract of green fields on 
the middle altitude of the S. end
of Nab Ridge.

Stumps 596960
Oak stump 2 ft dia
About 2 ft or more of peat below
roots. Two oak stumps and
some remains of birch exposed.
Oak stumos are in about the
state of decay of stumps felled
c. 1930, lichenized, small Vaccinium
plants on them. Upright, clearly
of trees which were felled or else
rotted standing.

Preissel beere. Abundant on Bilsdale
East Moor, 1100-1200 ft, in peaty
areas. Big clones, up to c.20 ft dia.,
which come well after burning - they
evidently have much underground
material.

Empetrum nigrum. Abundant on

-------------------------------------

Bilsdale E. Moor, 900-1200 ft, on
blanket peat. Grows more vigor-
usly than Calluna after burning.

Sphagnum. S. of palustre quite fre-
quent. The moor has little hummock
structure - hummocks and hollows
in general seem to be poorly developed
in the N. York Moors, perhaps because
of burning.

         THE HAGGS
A number of small fields full of
[23130-23131]
3130
[DIAG]
3131
[DIAG cont]
springs & flushes. Sheep-grazed. Mr
Proudman says they used to be cut
[23132-23133]
3132
for hay and have since been much
invaded by bracken & rushes.
  Pollard oaks and other trees
scattered over the fields and in
the gill ofT Tarn Hole Beck. Dia-
meter about 2 1/2 t 7 ft; evidently
a range of ages. Rings in a fallen
branch suggest last pollarding c.
1800.
  Few younger trees.
  Despite the name Haggs the pollards
do not look like the remains of a wood.
  They end rather diffusely at
about 800 ft altitude. Above this 
younger oaks, much branched, extend
to nearly 1600 ft; some birch inva-
sion. Remarkably little holly in this
area, though several hollies in hedges
elsewhere.
3133
Hill End Wood. A coppice with much
ash, said to have been coppiced in
part c. 1950.

Jet Mines. Red spoil-tips several to a
drift, occur around the 850 ft contour
all around Nab Ridge and into High
Wood.

Ash Nuikin. Very open wood, full of
bracken. Oak with some ash, freq.
hazel, occ. elm (nearly all dead).
Name not explained. Alder at bottom
Occ. holly. No pollards seen.
  Trees mostly >100 y old, some much
older but small areas of dense poles
esp. of alder. Boundaries indefinite.
Evidently grazed for many years. No
woodbanks seen.
[23134-23135]
3134
High Wood. Similar, but all oak. About
6 pollards inc. one by "Buckingham
Stone". Sheep-grazed, full of bracken,
trees sparse. Many oaks of 200+ years.
Edges very indefinite, unembanked.
Rievaulx Watercourse. Goes for many
miles through Bilsdale and along both
sides of Tarn Hole. Now derelict. A
small leat, crossing  many side stresms.
Said to be 18th cent.
Tarn Hole House. Ruins of ashlar-built
hut dated 1769, adjoining a number of
walled enclosures now all grown  with
bracken.
Kilns. Three seen, two based on great
broken boulders, the third dug into a barrow.
1 has no limestone remains, possibly for
making potash from bracken. 2 & 3 use a
small cap of calcareous sandstone. 3 
has bits of coal round it.
3135
Arncliffe Wood. Very largely conifer +
reed; patches of oak & other native trees
survive chiefly st the bottom and around
Mount Grace.

Whorlton Castle. Gatehouse large and
well-preserved. Front
& rear doorways           [DIAG]
each a segment of a circle.
Originally connected by a lierne-
vaulted passage now largely gone.
Rooms on either side had each a
fireplace and a garderobe (g). The
latter have rebates for the garderobe,
seat, ventilation loopholes and open
shafts in rthe thickness of the wall.
At least two upper floors, which have
large mullion-&-transom windows on
all sides; these presumably secondary
[23136-23137]
3136
tho' the stonework does not give clear
evidence of insertion. Fire
places on 1st floor. The      [DIAG]
usual tyoe od internal doorway is
the Caernarvon Arch with simple
chamfer.
  Inner ward has foundations
of curtain wall, and the choked-up
basement of a polygonal tower.
  All these occupy a large motte
adapted from a natural hill.
  Further remains of outer bailey,
long traversed by a road.

Little Broughton DMV. Humps * bumps.
555069.

Hedges in this area mostly mixed, with
much hazel.
3137
Bilsdale has mainly stone walla,
usualoly very thin s that much dayight
shows through, quite unvegetated.
Many walls, esp. along roads, are of
coursed sand blocks. Also
hedges esp in bottom of dale; these
mostly simple hawthorn.

Kilns in Bilsdale. Mr Proudman has
found an undated glassworks in his
garden at Hag House. Several fields
are called Kiln Field and asome od
these are associated with bits of burnt
sandstone in field-walls.

8idge-&-Furrow. Abundant tho' usually
burnt, Potto. Not seen in Bilsdale.

Bubby Wood, Carlton. Coniferized.

 Originally an  open hall  [DIAG]
