fields. Hedges mostly approx straight -
not forming a regular grid.
  Blackthorn is the commonest

Pig-sticking. Bill Cowley has
stuck pigs in India. You ride
around the jungle looking for wild
boar and with luck you find some.
You ride after them snd spear
them from behind. The spear
has a triangular point and no
crossbar.

Bracken. He and a friend were
given brscken shoots (the curled
tips of the young fronds) in India
where they are regarded as a delicacy.
They were both violently ill.
He says cattle & sheep eat bra-
cken and are poisoned by it un-
less only a very little is eaten.

G: holloway, with much hazel in sin-
uous hedges.
 Jet Mines. At around the 500 ft con-
 tour are many small adits for jet
 (19th cent.). Easily recognised by the
 spoil-heaps of shale. Large quantities
 of rock had to be searched for jet,
 which occurred as scattered logs. The
 shale is oily and has invariably
 been burnt, giving a charsacteristic
 red residue (used as road-metal).

Agriculture Bilsdale is relatively
wide. Mainly improved grassland; about
3% is under the plow.
   Boundary of moor and fields is
much as on O.S. Mr Proudman
says that bracken has much increased
of late at the expense of meadow 
& pasture. Yhere is, howeveer, a rela-
tively new tract of green fields on 
the middle altitude of the S. end

of trees which were felled or else
rotted standing.

Preissel beere. Abundant on Bilsdale
East Moor, 1100-1200 ft, in peaty

-------------------------------------

Bilsdale E. Moor, 900-1200 ft, on
blanket peat. Grows more vigor-
usly than Calluna after burning.

Sphagnum. S. of palustre quite fre-
quent. The moor has little hummock
structure - hummocks and hollows
in general seem to be poorly developed
in the N. York Moors, perhaps because
of burning.

         THE HAGGS
A number of small fields full of
[23130-23131]
3130
[DIAG]
3131
[DIAG cont]
springs & flushes. Sheep-grazed. Mr
Proudman says they used to be cut
[23132-23133]
3132
for hay and have since been much
invaded by bracken & rushes.
  Pollard oaks and other trees
scattered over the fields and in
the gill ofT Tarn Hole Beck. Dia-
meter about 2 1/2 t 7 ft; evidently
a range of ages. Rings in a fallen
branch suggest last pollarding c.
1800.
  Few younger trees.
  Despite the name Haggs the pollards
do not look like the remains of a wood.
  They end rather diffusely at
about 800 ft altitude. Above this 
younger oaks, much branched, extend
to nearly 1600 ft; some birch inva-
sion. Remarkably little holly in this
area, though several hollies in hedges
elsewhere.
3133
Hill End Wood. A coppice with much
ash, said to have been coppiced in
part c. 1950.

Jet Mines. Red spoil-tips several to a
drift, occur around the 850 ft contour
all around Nab Ridge and into High
Wood.

Ash Nuikin. Very open wood, full of
bracken. Oak with some ash, freq.
hazel, occ. elm (nearly all dead).
Name not explained. Alder at bottom
Occ. holly. No pollards seen.
  Trees mostly >100 y old, some much
older but small areas of dense poles
esp. of alder. Boundaries indefinite.
Evidently grazed for many years. No
woodbanks seen.
[23134-23135]
3134
High Wood. Similar, but all oak. About
6 pollards inc. one by "Buckingham
Stone". Sheep-grazed, full of bracken,
trees sparse. Many oaks of 200+ years.
Edges very indefinite, unembanked.
Rievaulx Watercourse. Goes for many
miles through Bilsdale and along both
sides of Tarn Hole. Now derelict. A
small leat, crossing  many side stresms.
Said to be 18th cent.
Tarn Hole House. Ruins of ashlar-built
hut dated 1769, adjoining a number of
walled enclosures now all grown  with
bracken.
Kilns. Three seen, two based on great
broken boulders, the third dug into a barrow.
1 has no limestone remains, possibly for
making potash from bracken. 2 & 3 use a
small cap of calcareous sandstone. 3 
has bits of coal round it.
3135
Arncliffe Wood. Very largely conifer +
reed; patches of oak & other native trees
survive chiefly at the bottom and around
Mount Grace.

Whorlton Castle. Gatehouse large and
well-preserved. Front
& rear doorways           [DIAG]
each a segment of a circle.
Originally connected by a lierne-
vaulted passage now largely gone.
Rooms on either side had each a
fireplace and a garderobe (g). The
latter have rebates for the garderobe,
seat, ventilation loopholes and open
shafts in rthe thickness of the wall.
At least two upper floors, which have
large mullion-&-transom windows on
all sides; these presumably secondary
[23136-23137]
3136
tho' the stonework does not give clear
evidence of insertion. Fire
places on 1st floor. The      [DIAG]
usual tyoe od internal doorway is
the Caernarvon Arch with simple
chamfer.
  Inner ward has foundations
of curtain wall, and the choked-up
basement of a polygonal tower.
  All these occupy a large motte
adapted from a natural hill.
  Further remains of outer bailey,
long traversed by a road.

Little Broughton DMV. Humps * bumps.
555069.

Hedges in this area mostly mixed, with
much hazel.
3137
Bilsdale has mainly stone walla,
usualoly very thin s that much dayight
shows through, quite unvegetated.
Many walls, esp. along roads, are of
coursed sand blocks. Also
hedges esp in bottom of dale; these
mostly simple hawthorn.

Kilns in Bilsdale. Mr Proudman has
found an undated glassworks in his
garden at Hag House. Several fields
are called Kiln Field and asome od
these are associated with bits of burnt
sandstone in field-walls.

8idge-&-Furrow. Abundant tho' usually
burnt, Potto. Not seen in Bilsdale.

Hambleton Hills. The contrast between
the dales and the almost flat pla-
teau is remarkable.
  No moorland survives from Sutton
Bank to Sproxton. The remaining moor-
land of Sproxton has been coniferized
about 20 y. Bracken suggests acid
soils. Farmland is quite extensive;
ruined walls suggest enclosure of
quite long standing. Stoneless dark
soils, not looking like limestone.

M. Atherden tells me that this was
regarded as an important site an
thought to be primary, though this is
manifestly unlikely. Until recently c.
50 plants. Shade has been increasing
despite perfunctory cutting of [????])
but she thinks browsing more of
a hazard. The area was rabbit-fenced
a few years ago and evidently has
very many rabbits inside; hawthorn
and ash bark severely eaten, and
ash damage evidently goes back many

Wheeldale Moor.
Roman Road.
[DIAG]

Paved very irregularly with sandstone
boulders, c. 1 ft across. This is said to
be the middle structure of a road, which
had a gravel surface.

Moor. Almost pure heather 
with about 10% Erica tetralux.
Thin peaty topsoil on yellow clay
with boulders.
  The road runs N.N.E. from approx.
802970. The first section is in
moorland; after crossing the road, it
runs into improved grassland.

  Across the moor (AB) the dyke is
like a woodbank, low and rounded,
in much worse condition than the Roman
earthworks at Cawthorne. No Erica
or Molinia in this part of the
moor. The general moor is flat and
featureless, with no features except
barrows snd the preposterous "shooting
houses". Thin peat.
  CD descends a steep slope. Here
the dyke has an  outer as well as an
inner ditch; the outer is prob. orig-
inal but widened by erosion.
D crossed a sike; there is no
culvert. Much Polytrichum formosum,
some Juncus, Sphagnum. Bank
faintly traceable to E.
[23156-23157]
EF: bank continues with a
ruined wall on it. (No trace of a
wall on any other part of the bsnk.)
[23156-21357]
3256
  FG: bank faintly traceable
thru' improved grsssland, prob. plowed.
  GH: descends steeply to stream,
definite ditch both sides.
  HI: apparently lost.
  IJ: steeply rises, ditch both
sides. Interrupted at J by road,
which may well be later than park;
road has wall only on upper side.
  JK: field wall on definite bank.
  The whole E. part of the park is
a nondesript 19th-cent. house. The
valley at H is uncultivated, with
remains of sn old peat-cutting in
bottom. Molinia, Polytrichum, Sphag-
num on several ft of peat. The
W. slope of this vlley has a small
stand of gnarled spreading oaks.

Cook's Grange cont. years. Browsing
more than shade is thought to be 
the desth of thr mezereon; the one
surviving plant, with scars indicating
c. 20 y. old, is not obviously browsed
but in considersble shade. One flower
is crinmson, scented.

Stape. Small island of farmland, cor-
responding to the Oxford Clay. No
church in hamlet.

Rawcliff Howe. By barrow cut away
by road.

Wheeeldasle Gill. Small ravine at 801-
992, brackeny valley (like all valleys
on the Moors) with small low oaks,
also scattered thorns, hazels, rowans.
Said to be a small oakwood a little up
the valley.      ---> p.3161

Vale of York. Mainly arable; vast prairie
fields, hedges mainly simple.

Ripon. No evident timber houses.

Devil's Arrows. Boroughbridge (cf
p. 3111). Three monoliths of mill-
stone grit standing in line;
a gap suggests that there
were once four. The
biggest is about 20 ft out
of the ground and 4ft thick,
of roughly square section.
They are deeply channelled    [DIAG]
in the upper part, which is
said to be due to wea-
thering. Lichens rather
poor, none fruticose. They
bear no relation to present topo-
graphy. Hedges much as in 1725;
hedge trees fewer, mostly sycamores.

Goathland Moor. Nearly pure heather,
extending right up to the Corallian
scarp at Saltergate. Little or no
Molinia even in valleys. Most valleys
are full of bracken.
[23162-23163]

Hole of Horcum. Now uninhabited
and mostly moorland, though sur-
rounded by farmland. Some grass-
land remains in the bottom.

Lockton. The great plateau of Lock-
ton Low Moor (higher than Lockton
High Moor) is entirely farmland,
large hedgeless fields evidently the
result of recent [????asscuting]. More
prairie-farming S. of the village.
  The trees on Crossdyke have 
just been felled.

Newton Dale woods. Almost all coni-
ferized.

Warm, rather damp day with rain
