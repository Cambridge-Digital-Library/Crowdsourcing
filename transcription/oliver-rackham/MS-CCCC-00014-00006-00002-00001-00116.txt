Wells Park Wood.
Marshy wood on flat
ground. Much standing water.
Oak: inimeuse widely
spaced standards.

Poplar: freq. standards.

Hazel: thin understorey,
prob. not coppiced.

Sallow: a[????]b[????].

Angelica   Anemone
Vicia sepium
Ash & Elm are remarkably
absent.

To the S., a small part
of this wood is apparently
planted with beech, now
sizeable trees but younger
than the oak.
No shrubs. Few anemones
the only herbs.

A large mistletoe grows
on a nearly-dead apple
tree at Dulcote.
Dulcote Hill, a large part
of which is now quarried
away, is a steep hill with
limestone grassland planted

8867

largely with exotic trees. No
juniper.
Several very large oaks
occur at Launcherley.
The woods and belts on
the Queen's Sedgemoor are
largely alder, some formerly
coppiced. The whole area is
enclosed and drained. It is
all pasture rather than ara-
ble.
Avalon is mainly orchards
but has much pasture. There
may be old grassland on
Glastonbury Tor.
Several showers of hail
occurred during the day. One
(encountered on Dulcote Hill)
was very severe and accom-
panied by a strong wind which
made it quite painful.

Shapwick Diggings.
Bracken is dominant
& almost pure in an un-
dug area (old pasture?)
with widely-spaced
oaks branching almost
from the ground & very
large.   Area C.
Pines have been planted
in this area but have not
done well.
There are also large
areas of willow carr, espe-
cially in the adjoining
nature reserve (not visited).
Holtonia is frequent in
deep trenches in the peat
which contain about 3ft
of water.

Windmill Hill Wood, Compton Dundon.
Very steep S facing slope.
No outcrops. No coppice.

Elm dom., very unevenaged,

At the S. end of White-
knight's Park, in an arti-

very fine Taxodium trees
up to 2ft diam., growing
in water. They do not
appear to produce any pneu-
matophores.
In the same place is an
unusually fine Libocedrus

Ash. Always coppice.
Saplings rare. Stools
to 6ft across, but
large ones very elliptical.
Well healed over at top.

8893

Stools 9" - 1' 3" high, occ.
over 18". Poles often can-
kered. Stools well healed,
tho' not as well as in Monks'
Wood.

Elm. Usually a pure
stand, but not overtopping
oaks. All small though no
sign of obvious coppicing.
Twigs in rows on trunk, often
double rows.

Oxlip. Density seldom less
than 1 plant per sq. m.
even in mercury areas. Absent
from S. & W. parts of sec
6 & 7.
Most parts of the wood
have a few plants with

Differences from Hayley.
1. Miss Banks says that
Knapwell was clear felled
c. 1918 to make aeroplanes.
Oaks now all coppice or
young. Regeneration good
outside elm areas.
2. Ash stools lower.
3. Hawthorn mainly mono-
gyna.
4. Oxlips associated with
the neighbourhood of rides.
5. Bluebell zones restricted,
oxlip often mixed with
mercury. Is this because
zones 2 & 3 are artefacts
produced by clearing?
6. Much more eutrophic
(nettles, elder, Galium).

New Wood (area [SYMBOL])
This is shown as pasture
on the 1650 map; the
boundary coincides closely

8901

with the double bank and
ditch now visible.
Remarkable in that
about 2/3 of the trees are
ash, the rest elm. Occas-
ional ash in the rest of
the wood. There are
about 6 old ash stools,
some nearly as large as
the biggest in Hayley.
Either these are less than
300 years old or they were
originally outside the wood;
the latter is just possible
as there are not many
of them. A very few simi-
lar stools are scattered in
the lower part of the 
wood. Last coppiced c.
1928? No other sign of

[8902-8903]
8902

coppice in the wood.
This area is mainly
bluebells but contains some
oxlips, particularly on the
N. side. Slope less steep
than below.
A few large ash stools
are associated with the bank.

Oxlips are very abund-
ant and show little vari-
ation all the way along
the W. side of the wood.
They reach as far E. as
the W. bank of the inner
bailey.

The "murder bank"

The oxlip community

wood and do not form
an intermediate zone.
Oxlips are flowering
very well. The density of
infls is much greater than
in Hayley. None were seen
to be nipt off.
The W. edge of the
wood is not well defined.
It merges gradually
into the lawns of the
Hall. Primroses and cow-
slips occur, the former
probably planted.
Carex pendula occurs in
the S.E. of the wood (planted?).

of the wood, usually

This grove is on a

hillside, the slope increasing
to the S. and E. It has
four selions on the flatter
part, taking up about
half the area. The oxlips
are on the sloping part.
To the W. it adjoins a
field in which the selions
run differently; to the N.
a broad track; to the S.
a plantation of Douglas;
to the E. a tract of open
scrubby wood and then
a willow carr with some
large deep pools (brick pits?).
Vegetation phosphatic but
not strongly so. This
could be a fragment of
ancient woodland at
one time partly cultivated;

there is no ditch to mark
its edge.

Bourn Wood.
The part near the
road is very disturbed
(planting of sycamore
&c.) but is probably
an old elm wood.
It contains a
"murder bank" similar
to that in Longstowe.
The part behind
the cottage is apparently
an additon ; the side
banks are on the same
scale as the murder bank.
The ground vegetation
is grassy with Rubus
caesius. Oxlips occur

Abundant on sides of
newly-cleared ditch, and
in old overgrown hedge.
Under hawthorn & sallow.
With Stachys sylvatica and
primrose. Forms one pure
patch c. 2ft x 4ft, and
a number of smaller colon-
ies. At B, it flourishes on
the sides of a recently
cleaned ditch and in the
spoil from the ditch.

Primula elatior occurs
only in area CC, known as
Rot Hills, which is raised
about 5ft above the surroun-
ding level peat. Plants grow
among tall fen vegetation.
