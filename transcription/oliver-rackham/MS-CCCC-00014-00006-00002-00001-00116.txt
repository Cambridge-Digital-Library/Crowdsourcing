March 26.
Wells Park Wood.
Marshy wood on flat
ground. Much standing water.
Oak: inimeuse widely
spaced standards.

Poplar: freq. standards.

Hazel: thin understorey,
prob. not coppiced.

Sallow: a[????]b[????].

Maple: freq. in understorey.

Angelica   Anemone
Vicia sepium
Ash & Elm are remarkably
absent.

To the S., a small part
of this wood is apparently
planted with beech, now
sizeable trees but younger
than the oak.
No shrubs. Few anemones
the only herbs.

A large mistletoe grows
on a nearly-dead apple
tree at Dulcote.
Dulcote Hill, a large part
of which is now quarried
away, is a steep hill with
limestone grassland planted

8867

largely with exotic trees. No
juniper.
Several very large oaks
occur at Launcherley.
The woods and belts on
the Queen's Sedgemoor are
largely alder, some formerly
coppiced. The whole area is
enclosed and drained. It is
all pasture rather than ara-
ble.
Avalon is mainly orchards
but has much pasture. There
may be old grassland on
Glastonbury Tor.
Several showers of hail
occurred during the day. One
(encountered on Dulcote Hill)
was very severe and accom-
panied by a strong wind which
made it quite painful.

[8868-8869]
8868   March 27.
Shapwick Diggings.
Bracken is dominant
& almost pure in an un-
dug area (old pasture?)
with widely-spaced
oaks branching almost
from the ground & very
large.   Area C.
Pines have been planted
in this area but have not
done well.
There are also large
areas of willow carr, espe-
cially in the adjoining
nature reserve (not visited).
Holtonia is frequent in
deep trenches in the peat
which contain about 3ft
of water.


8869
Windmill Hill Wood, Compton Dundon.
Very steep S facing slope.
No outcrops. No coppice.

Elm dom., very unevenaged,
older trees spreading.

Hawthorn (mono.), elm
suckers, Cornus main
shrubs, but shrub layer not
complete. Privet ab.

Mercury ground dom., fairly
complete carpet.
Hedera ab. on ground
Arum

Carex pendula ab. in
quite dry places.

This wood is at the
top of a steep slope. Soil
fertile, but no down-wash.
Vegetation rather calcar-
eous. Wood is probably
not ancient; a small

159. Botrydina. One large
patch found at Shapwick,
on the edge and side of a
deep trench in an area left
after the upper peat had
been removed. A plant re-
sembling Coriscium but smaller.
Toadstools abundant, like
Omphalina umbellifera but
stouter. (27.3.67)

Beech is planted round
Admiral Howe's monument,
but does not appear to
be native.

March 28.
Larch and pine grow suc-
cessfuly on coal-tips in
the Radstock area.
Iris foetidissima is abun-
dant in hedges at Limpley
Stoke, Wilts.
March 29.
Vegetation at Reading is no
more forward than at Cambridge.

4[SYMBOL]ft Cedrus atlantica (Whiteknoghts):
[!!!!]diam., [!!!!]c.1820.[!!!!] 151 years.
March 31.
At the S. end of White-
knight's Park, in an arti-
ficial swamp, are some
very fine Taxodium trees
up to 2ft diam., growing
in water. They do not
appear to produce any pneu-
matophores.
In the same place is an
unusually fine Libocedrus
perhaps 100ft high.
April 1.
The Akebia at Leckhamp-
ton has been touched by
frost. Some of the long shoots
are blackened. No other plants
appear to be damaged.

Ash. Always coppice.
Saplings rare. Stools
to 6ft across, but
large ones very elliptical.
Well healed over at top.

8893

Stools 9" - 1' 3" high, occ.
over 18". Poles often can-
kered. Stools well healed,
tho' not as well as in Monks'
Wood.

Elm. Usually a pure
stand, but not overtopping
oaks. All small though no
sign of obvious coppicing.
Twigs in rows on trunk, often
double rows.

Oxlip. Density seldom less
than 1 plant per sq. m.
even in mercury areas. Absent
from S. & W. parts of sec
6 & 7.
Most parts of the wood
have a few plants with

[8894-8895]
8894

primrose - like flowers
(petals overlapping) or
winged undulate
petioles. None with
short scapes.
Density of scapes
c. 15 ft [SYMBOL] in best areas.

& main ride
Differences from Hayley.
1. Miss Banks says that
Knapwell was clear felled
c. 1918 to make aeroplanes.
Oaks now all coppice or
young. Regeneration good
outside elm areas.
2. Ash stools lower.
3. Hawthorn mainly mono-
gyna.
4. Oxlips associated with
the neighbourhood of rides.
5. Bluebell zones restricted,
oxlip often mixed with
mercury. Is this because
zones 2 & 3 are artefacts
produced by clearing?
6. Much more eutrophic
(nettles, elder, Galium).
