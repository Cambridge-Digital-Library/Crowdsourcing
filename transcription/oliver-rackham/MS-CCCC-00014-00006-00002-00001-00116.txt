Angelica   Anemone
Vicia sepium
Ash & Elm are remarkably
absent.

To the S., a small part
of this wood is apparently
planted with beech, now
sizeable trees but younger
than the oak.
No shrubs. Few anemones
the only herbs.

A large mistletoe grows
on a nearly-dead apple
tree at Dulcote.
Dulcote Hill, a large part
of which is now quarried
away, is a steep hill with
limestone grassland planted

largely with exotic trees. No
juniper.
Several very large oaks
occur at Launcherley.
The woods and belts on
the Queen's Sedgemoor are
largely alder, some formerly
coppiced. The whole area is
enclosed and drained. It is
all pasture rather than ara-
ble.
Avalon is mainly orchards
but has much pasture. There
may be old grassland on
Glastonbury Tor.
Several showers of hail
occurred during the day. One
(encountered on Dulcote Hill)
was very severe and accom-
panied by a strong wind which
made it quite painful.

[8868-8869]
8868   March 27.
Shapwick Diggings.
Bracken is dominant
& almost pure in an un-
dug area (old pasture?)
with widely-spaced
oaks branching almost
from the ground & very
large.   Area C.
Pines have been planted
in this area but have not
done well.
There are also large
areas of willow carr, espe-
cially in the adjoining
nature reserve (not visited).
Holtonia is frequent in
deep trenches in the peat
which contain about 3ft
of water.

Very steep S facing slope.
No outcrops. No coppice.

Sanicle oc.
Carex pendula ab. in
quite dry places.

This wood is at the
top of a steep slope. Soil
fertile, but no down-wash.
Vegetation rather calcar-

159. Botrydina. One large
patch found at Shapwick,
on the edge and side of a
deep trench in an area left
after the upper peat had
been removed. A plant re-
sembling Coriscium but smaller.
Toadstools abundant, like
Omphalina umbellifera but
stouter. (27.3.67)
160. Part of the same, with
a toadstool.
161. Cladonia, peat surface.

peat for the next cut.
B. Diggings being worked

March 31.
At the S. end of White-
knight's Park, in an arti-
ficial swamp, are some
very fine Taxodium trees
up to 2ft diam., growing
in water. They do not
appear to produce any pneu-
matophores.
In the same place is an
unusually fine Libocedrus
perhaps 100ft high.
April 1.
The Akebia at Leckhamp-
ton has been touched by
frost. Some of the long shoots
are blackened. No other plants
appear to be damaged.
