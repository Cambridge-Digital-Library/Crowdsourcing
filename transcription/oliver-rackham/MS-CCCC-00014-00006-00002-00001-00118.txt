ELM dominant. Overhall
genotype with double
rows of twigs on trunk.
Uneven -aged, but no small
trees, and large trees all
felled (some tops lying
about).

ASH freq. but not forming
an understorey. Large low
stools with rather few piles.
35" dia. X 29" high (but
usu. lower). 54" X 18".
Well-grown & often healed
over.
Saplings absent, except a
few in shallow water of the
moat. [SYMBOL]

Elm much thinned in the

9009
S.W. part, hence dense growth
of young suckers.

Nettle [SYMBOL] usual co-dom.
Galium [SYMBOL] Nettle to 5ft high,
not higher or more dense
in moat.

Bluebell generally present
but seldom ab., except in
thinned area.

Maple only in NE strip,
and then not large.
The NE strip contains at
least as large elms as the main
wood. Also on & near SE bdy bank.

Armillaria rhizomorphs
seen on elm toppings.

[9010-9011]
9010
(i.e. the common
woodland grass).
Conium occurs all along
the boundary bank on the
S.E. side.
Lanium album is scat-
tered along the S.E. side.

This wood very much
resembles the upper part
of Overhall, but has no cor-
responding wet area.
It shows no internal zon-
ation. The areas outside
the boundary bank (prob-
ably resulting from suckering
of the elm, though this is
not very free) are not dis-
tinguishable from the rest

9011
of the wood; along the
S.W. side there are a few
old ash stools.
The wood contains
a number of non-wood-
land plants such as Allium
vineale, Galium Cruciata,
Conium, and Lamium album.

Thorofare Spinney.
Has an ancient ap-
apearance. A low bank
borders Thorofare Lane. The
wood is an ash coppice,
stools to 3ft X 1ft 4 in.
Both hawthorns.
Crab frequent.
Bluebells & mercury.
Nettles frequent.
No oxlips seen, but

[9012-9013]
9012
time did not permit a
thorough search.
Bluebells continue along
Thorofare Lane to the W.,
where the lane enters a
deep soft gulley enclosed
by high elms and ashes.

Galium Cruciata is ab-
undant on the roadside
verges between Knapwell
and the A45.
Mercury lines the ditch
on the E. side of the road
between Knapwell Wood and
the A45.

April 23. [cont. from p. 8998]
Hayley Wood.
Poa annua is abund-

9013
and in the Glade.
Senecio vulgaris was seen 
in the Glade.
Leptodictyon occurs on
the submerged base of the
triple oak by the pond.
A small elder bush was
found by the pond.
Picris echioides is eaten,
probably by deer.
Tremella mesenterica can
still be seen.
Pertusaria amara is fre-
quent on oaks.
April 30.
Lap-close Spinney, Box-
worth, is a small wood
of elms with Anthriscus

fairly well-drained; the
bottom in the N.E. part
of the woods is flat and
has a little standing

the pig-farm clearing.
No large earthworks.

Elm.
Dominant everywhere.
Tree with double-rows

Very even-aged: largest
trees logged out. Few
small trees. Probably cop-
piced.

Almost entirely logged
out. Many stumps, probably
First War. A few scattered
surviving trees, mostly
Maidens, esp. in the NE
corner. Coppiced trees a small

Comparison.
1. Elm dominant, much as
in Overhall. This is probably
a recent artefact brought
about by logging, but the
widespread distribution of
the elms must be
natural.
2. Large coppice poorly
represented: are stools
slowly eliminated by elm?
A few large stools exist.
3. No definite small cop-
pice.

[9030-9031]
9030
4. Hawthorn scarce, mainly
monogyna but oxyacanthoides
occurs.
5. No oxlip.
6. No mercury.
7. Filipendula frequent,
but seldom dominant.
8. Disturbance plants other
than primrose (ivy, nettle,
elder, Anthriscus, &c.) local.
9. No area as wet or as
dry as parts of Hayley.
10. Definite zonation, 3A
surrounded by 4.
11. No ridge - & - furrow or
other earthworks. Grips
are shallow and probably
recent drainage channels,
except the main one
N.W. - S.E.

9031
The wood thus appears
at first sight to be secondary,
but has a numberr of ancient
features, others of which may
have disappeared in recent
years.
May 1. The proportion of the
Leckhampton cowslips having
dark red or brown flowers
is apparently slightly smaller
this year.
May 2. The cedars in Leck-
hampton are shedding their
old leaves while the new
are not fully expanded.
May 3. The clematis buds are
very slow to advance.

two plants of an oxlip-prim-

abundant in the area;

frequent on rides else-
where in the wood, & said
to hybridize with oxlips);
primroses said not to occur

top.
Many of the small ash
stools along the ride have
recently been sawn off
below the crown. One 
stump revealed was 140[SYMBOL]20
years old (uncertainty due
to small hollow in middle,
and zones of very narrow
rings presumably from cop-
picing). Zones of narrow
rings suggest coppicing at
8, 36, 69, 88, 120 years before
felling (i.e. 1958, 1930, 1897,
1878, 1846, or at intervals of 
28, 33, 19, 32 years).
A block taken from one
of these stools shows a
possible episode 38 years
before [!!!!]copp[!!!!] felling.

Earthworks.
Ditton Park Wood shows
little embarking. The bank
between Secs 9 and 13 may
be its one-time N.W. limit.
The main rides appear
to have been ditched
before the Forestry Commis-
sion.
The voard drift running
past Charcoals continues un-
diminished, 11 paces wide,
until it meets the N. E.
main ride, where it be-
comes narrower. It continues
through the wood and
enventually becomes the S.E.
main ride. There is no sign
that it was ever prolonged
in a straight line through

Sec. 18.
Charcoals is much more
definitely embanked.
[!!!!]Ne[!!!!] Stinging-nettles are
scarce in either wood.

Conclusions.
1. Ditton Park Wood, though
probably on an ancient site,
was almost certainly replan-
ted as standards with large
coppice early in the 19th cent.
2. The N.W. part may have been
pasture in the remote past.
3. There was little or no small
coppice.
4. Ground vegetation follows
the usual W. Cambs categories,
though bluebells and oxlips
are much less prominent.

9051
5. Species rare or absent in
W. Cambs:
Geum rivale - ab.
Carex pendula - ab.
Euphorbia amygdaloides - local.
Pteridium - local.
6. Species of recent woodland
-primrose, ivy, &c, - are rare
or absent.
7. Charcoals Wood is much
more likely to have a contin-
uous history. It is mainly 
2-storied, with elm coppice
of a type not represented
in W. Cambs. Ground flora
much more limited and
drier. The abundance of elm
contrasts with its absence in 
D.P.W.

tremely intense rain for

rain found its way

Fordham alder-wood is

some hard-core in places

probably from a former
bridge and pathway.
The alder trees are
up to 30 years old, the
wood soft and reddening
when cut, markedly foxy.
Humulus is abundant
in this wood. The
reed-beds strongly suggest
that it was open quite
recently.

some seven years old, they
are only 9 in. - 2 ft high.

Fulborne Mill Fen
Flowing water-courses
(apparently from Sharde-
lowe's well, which at
one time turned the
mill but is now much
reduced by the water-
works) [SYMBOL]

[9072-9073]

Scrophularia aquatica
Lamium album
Lithospermum officinale

was seen here among tall
vegetation.

F. Wide drive, overhung in
places by tall elms, with
tall vegetation.

G. Rough grassland with
rather poor flora.

H. Moat. A large rectangular
moat, not above 3 ft deep
at any point, with a
considerable mound inside.
No definite entrance gap,
but a shallow place at the

9073
S. end of te W. side. Ditches
leave the moat at the N.E.
and S.W. corners; a shallow
quite dry ditch runs across
the meadow from the S.E.
corner. Numerous fragments
of brick and tile, probably
modern, in the S.W. corner;
remains of wire netting and
corrugated iron probably from
pheasant rearing.
The moat is entirely
wooded:
Elm dom.
Pinus sylv. mostly dead but
some survive.
Alder in moat itself.
Populus canadensis freq.
Elder
Ivy on ground

[9074-9075]

Ribes rubrum
Nettles almost everywhere, to
6 ft
Arum
Solanum dulcamara in water.
A curious maple, prob-
ably a form of A. Campestre
with small hairy rounded
leaves, occurs at the S. side
of the moat.
Conium and Carduus
crispus are very luxuriant
just outside the moat on
the S. side.

The ditch (largely new) has
been cut down about 9 ft deep.

[9076]
The section is mainly chalky
sand with flints, and a few
inches of peat on top. At
one point the ditch cuts
through the following:
