ELM dominant. Overhall
genotype with double
rows of twigs on trunk.
Uneven -aged, but no small
trees, and large trees all
felled (some tops lying
about).

ASH freq. but not forming
an understorey. Large low
stools with rather few piles.
35" dia. X 29" high (but
usu. lower). 54" X 18".
Well-grown & often healed
over.
Saplings absent, except a
few in shallow water of the
moat. [SYMBOL]

Elm much thinned in the

9009
S.W. part, hence dense growth
of young suckers.

Nettle [SYMBOL] usual co-dom.
Galium [SYMBOL] Nettle to 5ft high,
not higher or more dense
in moat.

Bluebell generally present
but seldom ab., except in
thinned area.

Maple only in NE strip,
and then not large.
The NE strip contains at
least as large elms as the main
wood. Also on & near SE bdy bank.

Armillaria rhizomorphs
seen on elm toppings.

[9010-9011]
9010
(i.e. the common
woodland grass).
Conium occurs all along
the boundary bank on the
S.E. side.
Lanium album is scat-
tered along the S.E. side.

This wood very much
resembles the upper part
of Overhall, but has no cor-
responding wet area.
It shows no internal zon-
ation. The areas outside
the boundary bank (prob-
ably resulting from suckering
of the elm, though this is
not very free) are not dis-
tinguishable from the rest

9011
of the wood; along the
S.W. side there are a few
old ash stools.
The wood contains
a number of non-wood-
land plants such as Allium
vineale, Galium Cruciata,
Conium, and Lamium album.

Thorofare Spinney.
Has an ancient ap-
apearance. A low bank
borders Thorofare Lane. The
wood is an ash coppice,
stools to 3ft X 1ft 4 in.
Both hawthorns.
Crab frequent.
Bluebells & mercury.
Nettles frequent.
No oxlips seen, but

[9012-9013]
9012
time did not permit a
thorough search.
Bluebells continue along
Thorofare Lane to the W.,
where the lane enters a
deep soft gulley enclosed
by high elms and ashes.

Galium Cruciata is ab-
undant on the roadside
verges between Knapwell
and the A45.
Mercury lines the ditch
on the E. side of the road
between Knapwell Wood and
the A45.

April 23. [cont. from p. 8998]
Hayley Wood.
Poa annua is abund-

9013
and in the Glade.
Senecio vulgaris was seen 
in the Glade.
Leptodictyon occurs on
the submerged base of the
triple oak by the pond.
A small elder bush was
found by the pond.
Picris echioides is eaten,
probably by deer.
Tremella mesenterica can
still be seen.
Pertusaria amara is fre-
quent on oaks.
April 30.
Lap-close Spinney, Box-
worth, is a small wood
of elms with Anthriscus
under.

fairly well-drained; the

has a little standing
water; there is also open
water in the N.W. part,
and a few pools N.W. of
the pig-farm clearing.
No large earthworks.
Neither oxlips nor mercury
were seen at all. Ground
vegetatioon dominated by
grass locally in the S. part,
locally also by Rubus sec.
