REGDRAVE FEN
Middle- Little Fen- Ditch

Valley remain free of the foul

The area seems to be largely 
blown sand partly overlain by peat, 
Between the Little Ouse and Wave-

[16188-16189]
6188
ney there is a definite sand 
dune running N. and S. and 
about 200 yards wide, forming 
a peat-free watershed between 
the two rivers. The uppermost 
course of the Waveney is a 
clearly artifical ditch some 
4ft deep, dug into the peat 
and sand, and presumably re-
placing a number of ill-defined
natural seepages. 
 The sand ridge is largely heath-
land, partly overgrown by birches, 
some of them old. It has patches 
of Schoenus. 
 The whole of Little Fen is 
covered in peat-diggings. These
are pits about 30ft across and 
at least 8ft deep, forming a 
polygonal pattern. The baulks
6189
between polygons form a series of 
paths. The pits mostly contain 
Cladium and some of them have
deep water. These are the home 
of Dolomedes. Eric Duffey was
anxious about the decline of such 
open water [although a compari-
son with air photographs of the 
1950s shows that most of the 
pools then existing are still there, 
despite the much lower water
level]. 
 The canalized lower course 
of the Lopham Beck is heavily 
polluted by agriculture. The
current of the Waveney comes 
largely from a water-softening 
installation in Redgrave discharging 
opposite the mouth of the Beck. 
A sluice has been installed above

[16190-16191]
6190
this point to retain "native" water 
on the Fen.  
 The Fen is almost wholly 
surrounded by birch and sallow 
belts of considerable age. Birch
and sallow bushes are as yet 
only scattered on the Fen itself, on 
the western heathland and the 
baulks, but need to be grubbed 
out.
 A tractor has been used for 
cutting sides. The peat is still 
soft and would not stand much 
tractor use.

March 16. 
Elms. 
 Flowering generally poor in 
the Baldock area; good around
Hitchin & Welwyn. 
 No appreciable number of 
dead trees seen N. of King's Cross. 
 Between Shenfield and 
Chelmsford about half the 
elms seem to be dead, most 
of those with the bark coming 
off. Flowering of surviving 
elms (which vary genetically)
is patchy but generally poor. 

Black Poplar. 
 Two trees by the roadside
at Montnessing, about 10ft 
x 12ft dia. Habit & bosses 
of P. nigra, but less pronounced

than usual.

 No fresh elm stumps
seen. However, elms seldom 
occur adjoining the main road.

  Farm belongs to Commander
Holdsworth. Biggish 16th-cent.

 In the middle of the paddock
immediately W. of the house is a 
pollard oak 14'6" girth. Top

clination to split. 
 For the Spready Oak beside 
Hazel Wood see red book. 
 Farm is now wholly arable.

   Hedge pattern around Slough 
Hall, with numbers of species. 
Cmdr Holdsworth says that the 
6195
modern hedges are due to his 
grandfather who abolished about 
25 fields. For details of the 
lettered hedges see blue book. 
The hedge E. of Slough Hall 
is hawthorn and occasional rose, 
on a slight bank; 30 yds from 
the E. end it changed to a 
mixed hedge (lettered D), on a 
massive bank and different 
alignment. This is evidently a 
fragment of the ancient system 
which happens to survive. 
 Spready Oak: see blue book.

Black Poplars, Bury St Edmund's. 
 S.E. of town, in former mea-
dow between River Linnett and 
track of old railway. Meadow
is now long grass through lack 
of grazing; Bury eastern bypass 
is being made just E. of old

 Seven trees. One fell about 
10 years ago leaving 3 by river, 
of which 2 more recently fallen, and
3 by old railway.

Cambridge to Birmingham. 
 The Ouse washes are quite 
dry apart from about 1/4 acre
of wet mud. 
 In Rutland there are
large tracts of ridge-&-furrow
divided by hedges apparently 
of 2-3 spp. Numerous 
ash pollards, to c. 3 1/2 ft dia, 
in these hedges. Oaks and 
elms are few. 
 Substantial deciduous 
woods, "The Outwoods", survive 
near Hinckley. Mainly oak 
with hazel & sallow. No evi-
dence seen for large coppice.

Ryknild [DIAG]
Street is a 
narrow lane, 
mostly sunken, 
between high
mixed hedges. 
In one place
(near the woo E. of Rowney
Green, which appears ancient) 
there is a slight broadening 
where the holloway descends
a hill, and on the roadside
bank grow two moderate-sized
pollard  Tilie cordata. 
 This lane is typical of the 
country in Wythall, Berley, and
Alvechurch immediately S. if Birm-
ingham, a land of dispersed settle-
ment, lanes, and mixed hedges. 
[16202-16203]
Birmingham University. 
 The site seems to have been 
a Victorian park. Many fine old
beech trees. The Worcester &
Birmingham Canal is functional
 The bark of old beeches is 
a curious silvery-grey, doubtless
because of air-pollution. 
 To the east, around th golf 
course, are several ancient
sweet-chestnuts and pollard rakes, 
suggesting an earlier park.

Asplands Husk Coppice is a wood
[16204-16205]
mainly of timber oaks. It is
divided from Three-Oak-Hill by 
a steep field of grassland. 
Old Park Wood. Apparently 
similar to Three-Oak-Hill, but 
partly replanted. 
Coughton Park. Appears to be 
wholly coniferized. 

The Ridgeway. For several miles
to the S. of Redditch this road
is an ancient ribbon-development
with cottages, many of them 
timber framed, in long [????]
gardens which are evidently

front of the cottages are some-
times mixed; hat at the back
is either mixed or elm and is 
often lynchetted
