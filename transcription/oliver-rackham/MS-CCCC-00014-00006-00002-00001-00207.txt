The area seems to be largely 
blown sand partly overlain by peat, 
Between the Little Ouse and Wave-

[16188-16189]

ney there is a definite sand 
dune running N. and S. and 
about 200 yards wide, forming 
a peat-free watershed between 
the two rivers. The uppermost 
course of the Waveney is a 
clearly artifical ditch some 
4ft deep, dug into the peat 
and sand, and presumably re-
placing a number of ill-defined
natural seepages. 
 The sand ridge is largely heath-
land, partly overgrown by birches, 
some of them old. It has patches 
of Schoenus. 
 The whole of Little Fen is 
covered in peat-diggings. These
are pits about 30ft across and 
at least 8ft deep, forming a 
polygonal pattern. The baulkes

between poly[????] form a series of 
paths. The pits mostly contain 
Cladium and some of them have
deep water. These are the home 
of Dolomedes. Eric Duffey was
anxious about the decline of such 
open water [although a compari-
son with air photographs of the 
1950s shows that most of the 
pools then existing are still there, 
despite the much lower water
level]. 
 The canalized lower course 
of the Lopham Beck is heavily 
polluted by agriculture. The
current of the Waveney comes 
largely from a water-softening 
installation in Redgrave discharhing 
opposite the mouth of the Beck. 
A sluice has been installed above

on the Fen.
