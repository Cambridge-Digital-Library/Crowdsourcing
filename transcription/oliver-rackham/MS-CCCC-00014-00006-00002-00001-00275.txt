sec forest.
Species in old-field forests but
not seen in Albright's Grove:
Quercus prinus & nigra.

Summers are 4 beech? trunks 11"

car.
Remains of timber crib abut-
ments from previous bridge.
----------------------------------
Cymophyllus fraseri. Remarkable
plant like a Carex with one spike.
Exceptionally broad leaves with
curious serrated edge.
Tilia. Said by S. Bratton to be
only americana in this place.
Key in R.S.B. agrees. No very
large single stems, but tyoically
self-coppicing and forming giant 
stools.
[Poa alsodes - common widwood
grass.] [Prenanthes trifoliolata;
            Mitchella repens.]
[21294-21295]
1294
Hyrophyllum canadensse. Freq.
in wildwood valleys. The leaves
are sometimes very large and are
always peltate.

Magnolia [!!!!acuminata] tripetala. Generally
less common than M. fraseri in the 
woods.

Medeola virginiana. loc. ab. herb
on damp rocky slopes.

Botrichium virginianum. Same.

Thaspium trifoliatum.  Freq. in
wildwood.

Actnea pachypoda. Same.

Quercus prinus. The common
1295
white oak of lower sec. woods.
Almost indistinguishable from  Q. alba
except in leaf shape.

Vines. Two species of Vitis are
probably the commonest; there
are also Aristrolochia durior and
poison-ivy.
  Vitis is common in the old-field
woods. Some plants are very large,
with several massive stems from s
common base. They reach the top 
of the largest trees. They evidently
kept up with the tree when it was
growing, and owing to the disappear
ance of lower branches now hang 
unsupported for at least 70 ft.
Vines commonly pass from tree to 
tree well above the ground, and
in one place actually cross above
