----------------------------------
Cymophyllus fraseri. Remarkable
plant like a Carex with one spike.
Exceptionally broad leaves with
curious serrated edge.
Tilia. Said by S. Bratton to be
only americana in this place.
Key in R.S.B. agrees. No very
large single stems, but tyoically
self-coppicing and forming giant 
stools.
[Poa alsodes - common widwood
grass.] [Prenanthes trifoliolata;
            Mitchella repens.]
[21294-21295]
1294
Hyrophyllum canadensse. Freq.
in wildwood valleys. The leaves
are sometimes very large and are
always peltate.

Magnolia [!!!!acuminata] tripetala. Generally
less common than M. fraseri in the 
woods.

Medeola virginiana. loc. ab. herb
on damp rocky slopes.

Botrichium virginianum. Same.

Thaspium trifoliatum.  Freq. in
wildwood.

Actnea pachypoda. Same.

Quercus prinus. The common
1295
white oak of lower sec. woods.
Almost indistinguishable from  Q. alba
except in leaf shape.

Vines. Two species of Vitis are
probably the commonest; there
are also Aristrolochia durior and
poison-ivy.
  Vitis is common in the old-field
woods. Some plants are very large,
with several massive stems from s
common base. They reach the top 
of the largest trees. They evidently
kept up with the tree when it was
growing, and owing to the disappear
ance of lower branches now hang 
unsupported for at least 70 ft.
Vines commonly pass from tree to 
tree well above the ground, and
in one place actually cross above

a road above some 40
ft up. Connexions
between trees always hang down
with plenty of slack.

Albright's Grove.
Said to be the best wildwood in the
Smoky Mountains. Visited from the
public footpaths. The total area
seems to be sone 300 acres.
1297
  Steep rocky ground with many
boulders and occasional small out-
crops. Probably all siliceous rocks
(schists). Pockets of deep mineral
soil. Humus mainly mor-like.
  Lower ground (area E) is Tsuga
- Liriodendron with frequent beech,
ash, pry, etc. Upper part (area F)
is nearly pure Tsuga, but
with frequent Lirio. (The biggest of
which are around here) and maple and abun-
dant Halesia (rare below 3000 m).
  Castanea reoresented by one stump
at 3500 m. This forest has evidently
been little if at all affeted by the 
death of chesnut.
  Class-A hemlocks are evidently
of variable age, about 220 to
450 years; this is determined partly
by how long they were suppressed
[21298-21299]
1298
when young. Number of fallen logs
suggests that these sizes of hem-
lock are becoming less numerous.
  Ages of old tulips are indeter-
minate.
  Many hemlocks and other trees
have fallen in the last dfew years.
Fallen trees do not tend to occur
together (cf beech in England). The
cause is nor evident; it is not the
effect of one particular hurricsne
nor is it the result of the trees
being even-aged. (Nowhere else in
the Smokies was such a large
proportion of fallen trees encoun-
tered.)
  Beech my well be increasing.
  Shrub-layer abundant, parti-
cularly Rhododendron maximum,
which forms patchy thickets to
1299
such an extent asmy well inter-
fere with regeneration of trees.
When crushed by fall of big trees
Rhodo. is probsbly slow to recover;
the damage allows a well-de-
fined gap-phase commmunity to
arise. This is evidently where young
[!!!!] sugar-maples & Lirio. come
from.  Much hemlock is pre-es-
tablished under shade where there
is no Rhododendron.
  Old Tilia amer. are usually
multi-stemmed stools on boul-
ders; there is a young generation
probably arising in gap phase.

occasional P. strobus on N. facing
slopes.
  Castanea remains (stumps,
logs etc) are wholly confined to
gullies and the less steep slopes
on the N.-facing side. Here
[21328-21329]
1328
there were evidenty many trees
of 2 1/2 - 4 ft dia. but not probably as
great age. Probably more exten-
sive  at the higher altitudes.
  The mountain is mainly 
of gray steely rocks but has [!!!!]
yellow-brown sandy soils prob.
with some clay. Soils may be
thinner on he pine areas.

Tremont (Middle Prong) Valley.
[!!!!] Nearly continuous strip 
of Platanus along the river; this
tree behaves much as P. orien-
talis does in Greece.
  Around the junction of the
middle Prong and the main valley
are many sharp ridges covered
with pines.
  All the pineries appear to
1329
be the result of former burning.
S. Bratton says the pines require
a hotter fire to induce germina-
tion than do oaks.
Similar pineries occur on the
succession of ridges between
Tuckaleechee Cove and Maryville.

Terra rossa. Very extensive around
Maryville, where it is commonly sev-
eral ft thick and quite scarlet.

Bear. One of the party enountered

Little River Valley.
Very impressive gorge with incised
meanders; distant scene invisible
through mist. Rocky cliffs covered

[21330-21331]

  The road largely  follows the
course of a logging railroad.
  White oak appears normally
to be dominant. Much Pinus
virginiana on the thinner soils
and drier sites.
  The main period of logging is
said to have been the early 1920s
when the impending formation of
the National Park stimulated the
timber companies to extract as
much as they could lay hands
on.
  The Oxbow is an evident aban-
doned incised meander; the river 
has cut through the neck in a 
fine waterfall.

  This western part of the Park
has much more oak than the
1331
middle and east.
  White pine frequent in woods
with litle disturbance.
  Chestnut where it has disap-
peared has usually been replaced
by more oak.
The most wildwood-like area
- upper Meigs Creek - is remar-
kable for the abundance of beech
and yellow birch among the 
hemlock, and rather poor tree
flora. No Liriodendron (though
it is abundant higher). The 
very dense Rhododendron may
be significant.
