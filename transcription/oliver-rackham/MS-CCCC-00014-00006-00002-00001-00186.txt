        Features.
1. Slope site with stream at

probably a meadow between
the wood and the stream, the

latter being later diver-
ted to its present
course, which    [DIAG]

of the valley.
2. Massive sinuous bank all
round.
3. No internal earthworks save
one or two pits.
4. Internal valley at S.E. corner.
5. Numerous "black holes" of
the shallow Hayley type on
the S. side.
6. Boundary pollards include
several huge and remarkably
complex elms.  Most of the
latter have been pollarded
at two differnbet levels, probably
with a long interval between

COMPLEX ELM
POLLARD
That of p. 4338
has in addition an exposed
root bearing suckers.
7. Probably in the last century 
a 3-storeyed wood (apart from
the elm areas) with sparse LC
and very few standards.  Most
of the standards since felled.
Much of the wood is now
single coppice of pure hazel.
8. Ash rarer than in any other
BC wood save Hockering.
9. Complex elm situation with
6 elm areas.  That in the S.E.
4349
corner is an aggressive suckerer
and displaces other woodland.
That of p. 4334, and probably
of p. 4335, consist mainly
of stools but sucker weakly.
That in the S. boundary
appears to be a glabra hy-
brid, suckering rather less weakly.
That of p. 4340 is probably
pure glabra.,  There
are at least two overlaps
of elm areas, both probably 
of the coexistence type.
Such complexity is remarkable
for a small wood.
10. ALDER present.
11. SALIX FRAGILIS present
(2 maidens and 2 big stools)
12. Small internal fen valley

13. No aspen.
14. 22 native trees & shrubs.
15. One hornbeam.
16 Small apparently neutral
area (mainly coniferized) (Ane-
mone). Probably a little gravel
cap; surrounded by a wet
area.  no definite calcifuges.
17. Oxlip very abundant in
a small part of the wood.
18. Bluebell rare.
19. ADOXA abundant, often 
50% cover, on nearly half the 
E. wood-bank.
20 Campanula trachelium frequent
in open areas and marginal.
21. Large Allium area.
22. Carex riparia rare.

Interpretation.
  Said not to exist on a 
map of c. 1580.
  Woodland structure does
not suggest antiquity: no
large stools except on
boundary: large maple stools
explained by good drainage.
  Ancient woodland plants:
oxlip (rare), Crataegus oxy., 
mercury.
No positive evidence of
secondary woodland save
4361
perhaps primrose and horn-
beam (but these rare and marginal).
  Ancient woodland features
could be accounted for by
nearness to Aveley and exis-
tence of old hedges.

Bavin's Wood, Harbest & Shimpling.
  At the N.W. corner are
two cottages, one with s 
Victorian folly-like tower.

  The bank down the middle
is massive and mainly sinu-
ous, and separates the wood
into two structure types:
large & small coppice with few
standards to the N. & E., and
standards with little coppice

the great bank run-
ning through the wood is
usually high and massive.
The orien-   [DIAG]
tation on a 
4373
slope defies drainage require-
ments.
  In the high oaks along
the S. side are two large
rookeries.
  Most of the oaks in the
S. half of the wood are
close together, tall and 
narrow, now overmature (tho'
only c. 1 1/2 ft dia.) and many
stag-headed.
  Large trees in the N. half 
(incuding the E. side) are
much more spreading.
  A dry wood with little
standing water, even in the
flat low-lying N.E. part.
  The W. boundary (p. 4372)
is sinuous with a massive

[14374-14375]
4374
ditch embanked mainly on the
field side and running with
the same orientstion into the
wood at its N.E. end.  In
it is a grand ancient oak,
c. 4 ft dia., not pollarded, very
burred and much decayed 
at the top.  Two old oak
pollards in the field portion of
this boundary.

     Features.
1. Perimeter nearly all of
the "truncation" kind, with
dead straight boundaries and
slight banks.
2. Massive internal bank
corresponding to a discon-
tinuity in woodland struc-
4375
ture and to a considerable ex-
tent in vegetation.  this bank
has both sinuous and abrupt
bends.
3. Woodland N.E. of this bank
has aomething like a 3-storied
structure.
4. Woodland S.W. hasdense 
stasndards and very little coppice.
5. Acive coppicing.
6. Several curious exotics (box,
Seqquoia).
7. [!!!!One] Hornbeam standards
mainly in N.E. half and 
in N.W. handle and E. handle.
8. Other internal earthworks
corresponding less distinctly to
discontinuities of structure.
9. Large numbers of over-ma-
ture oaks.
[14376-14377]
4376
10. Elm standard and elm
stool both of exceptional size.
11. Hornbeam frequent and
dominant in large coppice.
12. Ash scarce, but commoner
than in Aveley.
13. Small area of ivy carpet.
14. Hellebore.
15. Probable [!!!!] tendency to
"neutral" in part of the S.W.
hlf: no mercury. Promrose
presenrt as hybrid.
16. Primrose & oxlip with ox-
lip in the majority.
17. Luzula pilosa (location un-
known).
18. No conclusive "natural" or
"artificial" surface features.
4377ation
  There is little doubt that the 
great bank is a wood-bank
and the wood to the N.E. is
secondary.  The topographical
evidence is very strong, espe-
cially ss the other banks in
the N.E. portion probably represent
steps in the enlargement of the
wood.
  Evidence of woodand struc-
ture points the other way, but
is not conclusive: see below.
  Ancient woodland plants:
mercur, yEuphorbia amyg., oxlip,
Luzula pilosa.
  Suggested sequence:
1. Large wood extending an
unknown distance to the S.W.,
with a tendency to "light" type
[14378-14379]
4378
hence having a poorly developed
structure and a minority of
primrose as well as oxlip.
2. Wood extended to the N.W.,
perhaps in stages overrunning
a Helleborus site. Oxlip &c.
enter new woodland which is
wetter than old.
3. (18th cent?). Wood truncated
to the S.W.
4. (19th cent.) Replanting.
Bank remembered and used
as boundary. Part to S.W. of
bank, a good oak site, planted
with oak and previous structure
largely destroyed.  Remainder,
a poorer oak site, left wiith its
old secondsary structure largely
intact.  Exotics planted in small
numbers.
4379
The wood has therefore moved
N.E. and the present wood is
partly "attached secondary" and
partly modified primary.
5. Further truncation in rhe 
20th cent. at the S.E. corner.
N.W. Handle.

  Presents some problems
regarding the boundary and
vegetation (ivy, hornbeam).
  In Stage 1in a different
ownership from the rest of
Hartest Wood, with a sinuous
[!!!!bank] ditch between.
  At Stage 3 more drastically
truncasted than the other
ownership and perhaps
otherwise disturbed in such a 
[14380-14381]
4380
way as to let in the ivy.
Ivy later invades adjoining
secondary woodland.  Hornbeam
enters at the same time? (but big stools).
  This explanation puts the
hellebore and most of
the elm and hornbeam in
2ndary woodland.

A deer, probably fallow,was 
was seen in the N.W. handle.
On the main internal bank
is an elm stool markedly elon-
gated in plan, 14 ft 10 in x c. 6 ft.
Canopy diameter 39 p. = 26.5
m.
4381
        Chadacre Park.
  Belt A contains some exotic
trees but is embanked and of
some standing  B is an old plan-
tation, heavily thinned, with
some big pines.
  Much of the parkj is per-
manent but recent grassland.
Usual 19th-cent, trees; fine
cedars (atlantica, libani, deodara).
  Many of the internal hedges
appear to be long-standing
(e.g. between Jubilee Field snd
Pond Thicks (perhaps not orig-
inally internal), mixed with
mercury).
 Between Front Park and
Barn Field is a recently made
stake-&-rice fence of coppice
material.
[14382-14383]
4382
  A few free-standing pollard
oaks and one on a boundary
in the Jubilee Wood area.
Jubilee Wood is a fine
mature plantation (evidently
1887) of larch with some ash
and sycamore, evidently pre-
viously farmland.
  Thicks and Graveyard are 
otherwise ordinary grass
fields in the bottom of a 
shallow valley from which
the stream has been diverted
to flow round the N. side of
Beavin's Wood.

 A large oak pollard
 lies at the S.W. corner, having


[14388-14389]
been uprooted this winter 
from a hedge running S.
from the corneer.  Pollard
branches partly dead, at
least 200 years old from
rings.  Tree probably only
slightly hollow.  Roots rather
small, to c. 9 in. dia.
shallow; trunk ending
abruptly without a tap root.
One sector of trunk with
roots dead recently.

Features.
1. Wood bank variable; E.
side perhaos more recent
than rest (cf 1st ed. 1"),
but internal earthworks do
4389
not support this.
2. Whole interior full of irre-
ular pits and mounds.
Numerous pits with water;
margins steeply sloping, per-
haps up to 3 ft deep.  In
the S.E. corner a mound 
perhaps 60 ft dia x 8 ft high,
covered with bricks and peg roofing tiles.
Other deposits of tiles else-
where in the S.E. part.  An
apparent bank and ditch
in the N. projection may con-
tinue but is intercepted by
pits.
3.Woodland structure high-
ly irregular.  Several pollard
willows.  Ash stools few but
regularly coppiced and some

4. HORNBEAM:  one tree only
but that a maiden of ex-
ceptional size.
5. ALDER: about 6 stools by
pits, a few poles.

dens and once-cuts on the
tile mounds; others in N.W.
corner.

Interpretation.
  A remarkably complex
wood for so small an area.
Must have some connexion
with primary woodland (?thro'
Chadacre Park; or is the
sinuous boundary roughly

parallel to the road the
remains of an ancient wood-
land formerly existing to the
W. of the present grove?
  The massive pits & mounds
presumably result from a 
works (18th cent. or earlier)
producing chiefly roof tiles.
Perhaps this was done by
digging up an existing cop-
pice wood of which the
few big ash stools are sur-
vivors.  Alder must be secondary.
Coppicing must have gone
on long after the works was
abandoned.

  The Chad Brook valley has been
somewhat damaged by drainage works
in the last few months.

rather dense and few plants
flowering.

Effects of present use.  [SYMBOL] 18
  About an acre on the E.
side is used for car-breaking.
Trees on site destroyed but
primroses flourish.  Little ten-
dency for this activity to
spread, and no further damager
to vegetation.
Main ride and its branch

[14414-14415]
4414
to the breaker's yard have
been widened and are used
for storing empty drums of
concentrated paint pigment ([SYMBOL]
18).  Little damage except by
fires in the drums which
have burnt some adjoining
lime and other stools.  Ride
vegetation damaged by laying
sleeper trackways.
  The rest of the wood
has a remarkably dense
network of rides, evidently
much walked in but without
any apparent damage.

       Features.
1. Striking hilltop site.
2. Charactristic wood bank,
broad and rather low, like
4415
Monks' Park;  but from the
outside it is formidable owing
to the slope of the ground
and resembles a massive 
lynchet or small hill-fort ([SYMBOL]
77).  The S. peninsula has
a similar bank cutting it
off from the rest of the
wood and also surrounding 
it on the outside.  Rounded
corners to the main embank-
ment.  North indentation has
a characteristic truncation
bank, narrow, high, and 
straight.  The rest of the
wood-bank is rather uniform
in profile save where it
carries a small parasitic 
bank to the W.
3. "Streamsde meadow" to
[14416-14417]
4416

large coppice (with few standards)
not long out of rotation.

6. Coppice stools chiefly
middle-sized to small, though
a few giants.
7. One boundary pollard (elm).
8. The largest area known
of mixed coppice in which
non-suckering elm is the
dominant or sub-dominant
constituent.  Probably two geno-
types mixed.
9. A conventional elm in-
vasion in the S.
10. Hornbeam strongly gregarious,
concentrated in two areas.
11. Lime much as in Brad-
field, strongly gregarious in
scattered groups of stools,
but less evidently calcifuge.

[14418-14419]
4418
Stools medium to large, low
to medium height, thus with
a similar range of stool
morphology to Bradfield No
tendency to layer or sucker.
12. Lime-elm probably unique
(cf Hockering).
13. Lime-elm-hornbeam
unique.
14. Elm-hornbeam rare (cf
Hempstead).
15. Lime overlaps with maple.
16. Clematis rare, marginal.
17, Hawthorn minly oxy.
18. Daphne abundant in
W. and N.W. margins (rare in
Suffolk).
19. Holly rare,marginal.
20. Broom present, near lime.
4419
21. Poplar very rare.
22. Birch and cherry appar-
ently absent.
23. Ivy carpetting a sharply
defined rectangular area
(apparently without any
earthwork at the boundary.
24. Ivy overlaps lime,
which is unique; though
the overlap is not large,
most of the lime occurring
outside the ivy area.
25. Three ponds, one very
large and regular, all evi-
dently dug out as ponds.
26. Surface somewhat irregu-
lar with shallow hollows.
27. Wet plateau in the middle
with drier slopes, although
