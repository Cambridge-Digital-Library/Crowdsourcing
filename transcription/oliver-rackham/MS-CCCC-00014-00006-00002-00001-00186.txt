        Features.
1. Slope site with stream at
bottom.  Originally there was 
probably a meadow between
the wood and the stream, the
4347
latter being later diver-
ted to its present
course, which    [DIAG]
is not quite      ORIGINAL
along the bottom  SITUATION
of the valley.
2. Massive sinuous bank all
round.
3. No internal earthworks save
one or two pits.
4. Internal valley at S.E. corner.
5. Numerous "black holes" of
the shallow Hayley type on
the S. side.
6. Boundary pollards include
several huge and remarkably
complex elms.  Most of the
latter have been pollarded
at two differnbet levels, probably
with a long interval between

COMPLEX ELM
POLLARD
That of p. 4338
has in addition an exposed
root bearing suckers.
7. Probably in the last century 
a 3-storeyed wood (apart from
the elm areas) with sparse LC
and very few standards.  Most
of the standards since felled.
Much of the wood is now
single coppice of pure hazel.
8. Ash rarer than in any other
BC wood save Hockering.
9. Complex elm situation with
6 elm areas.  That in the S.E.
4349
corner is an aggressive suckerer
and displaces other woodland.
That of p. 4334, and probably
of p. 4335, consist mainly
of stools but sucker weakly.
That in the S. boundary
appears to be a glabra hy-
brid, suckering rather less weakly.
That of p. 4340 is probably
pure glabra.,  There
are at least two overlaps
of elm areas, both probably 
of the coexistence type.
Such complexity is remarkable
for a small wood.
10. ALDER present.
11. SALIX FRAGILIS present
(2 maidens and 2 big stools)
12. Small internal fen valley
with the above two trees - al-

[14350-14351]

most unique in BC woodland.
13. No aspen.
14. 22 native trees & shrubs.
15. One hornbeam.
16 Small apparently neutral
area (mainly coniferized) (Ane-
mone). Probably a little gravel
cap; surrounded by a wet
area.  No definite calcifuges.
17. Oxlip very abundant in
a small part of the wood.
18. Bluebell rare.
19. ADOXA abundant, often 
50% cover, on nearly half the 
E. wood-bank.
20 Campanula trachelium frequent
in open areas and marginal.
21. Large Allium area.
22. Carex riparia rare.
23. Despite the scarcity of mature
4351
oaks, some natural regeneration
goes on.
24. Fine standard crab.

Woodland structure pecu-
liar but certainly ancient.
Ash stools very few but large,

  Symphoricarpos and Populus

Interpretation.
  Said not to exist on a 
map of c. 1580.
  Woodland structure does
not suggest antiquity: no
large stools except on
boundary: large maple stools
explained by good drainage.
  Ancient woodland plants:
oxlip (rare), Crataegus oxy., 
mercury.
No positive evidence of
secondary woodland save
4361
perhaps primrose and horn-
beam (but these rare and marginal).
  Ancient woodland features
could be accounted for by
nearness to Aveley and exis-
tence of old hedges.

Bavin's Wood, Harbest & Shimpling.
  At the N.W. corner are
two cottages, one with s 
Victorian folly-like tower.

  The bank down the middle
is massive and mainly sinu-
ous, and separates the wood
into two structure types:
large & small coppice with few
standards to the N. & E., and
standards with little coppice

the great bank run-
ning through the wood is
usually high and massive.
The orien-   [DIAG]
tation on a 
4373
slope defies drainage require-
ments.
  In the high oaks along
the S. side are two large
rookeries.
  Most of the oaks in the
S. half of the wood are
close together, tall and 
narrow, now overmature (tho'
only c. 1 1/2 ft dia.) and many
stag-headed.
  Large trees in the N. half 
(including the E. side) are
much more spreading.
  A dry wood with little
standing water, even in the
flat low-lying N.E. part.
  The W. boundary (p. 4372)
is sinuous with a massive

[14374-14375]
4374
ditch embanked mainly on the
field side and running with
the same orientation into the
wood at its N.E. end.  In
it is a grand ancient oak,
c. 4 ft dia., not pollarded, very
burred and much decayed 
at the top.  Two old oak
pollards in the field portion of
this boundary.

     Features.
1. Perimeter nearly all of
the "truncation" kind, with
dead straight boundaries and
slight banks.
2. Massive internal bank
corresponding to a discon-
tinuity in woodland struc-
4375
ture and to a considerable ex-
tent in vegetation.  This bank
has both sinuous and abrupt
bends.
3. Woodland N.E. of this bank
has aomething like a 3-storied
structure.
4. Woodland S.W. has dense 
standards and very little coppice.
5. Active coppicing.
6. Several curious exotics (box,
Seqquoia).
7. [!!!!One] Hornbeam standards
mainly in N.E. half and 
in N.W. handle and E. handle.
8. Other internal earthworks
corresponding less distinctly to
discontinuities of structure.
9. Large numbers of over-ma-
ture oaks.
[14376-14377]
4376
10. Elm standard and elm
stool both of exceptional size.
11. Hornbeam frequent and
dominant in large coppice.
12. Ash scarce, but commoner
than in Aveley.
13. Small area of ivy carpet.
14. Hellebore.
15. Probable [!!!!] tendency to
"neutral" in part of the S.W.
half: no mercury. Promrose
present as hybrid.
16. Primrose & oxlip with ox-
lip in the majority.
17. Luzula pilosa (location un-
known).
18. No conclusive "natural" or
"artificial" surface features.
4377
          Interpretation
  There is little doubt that the 
great bank is a wood-bank
and the wood to the N.E. is
secondary.  The topographical
evidence is very strong, espe-
cially ss the other banks in
the N.E. portion probably represent
steps in the enlargement of the
wood.
  Evidence of woodand struc-
ture points the other way, but
is not conclusive: see below.
  Ancient woodland plants:
mercur, Euphorbia amyg., oxlip,
Luzula pilosa.
  Suggested sequence:
1. Large wood extending an
unknown distance to the S.W.,
with a tendency to "light" type
[14378-14379]
4378
hence having a poorly developed
structure and a minority of
primrose as well as oxlip.
2. Wood extended to the N.W.,
perhaps in stages overrunning
a Helleborus site. Oxlip &c.
enter new woodland which is
wetter than old.
3. (18th cent?). Wood truncated
to the S.W.
4. (19th cent.) Replanting.
Bank remembered and used
as boundary. Part to S.W. of
bank, a good oak site, planted
with oak and previous structure
largely destroyed.  Remainder,
a poorer oak site, left wiith its
old secondary structure largely
intact.  Exotics planted in small
numbers.
4379
The wood has therefore moved
N.E. and the present wood is
partly "attached secondary" and
partly modified primary.
5. Further truncation in the 
20th cent. at the S.E. corner.
N.W. Handle.

  Presents some problems
regarding the boundary and
vegetation (ivy, hornbeam).
  In Stage 1 in a different
ownership from the rest of
Hartest Wood, with a sinuous
[!!!!bank] ditch between.
  At Stage 3 more drastically
truncated than the other
ownership and perhaps
otherwise disturbed in such a 
[14380-14381]
4380
way as to let in the ivy.
Ivy later invades adjoining
secondary woodland.  Hornbeam
enters at the same time? (but big stools).
  This explanation puts the
hellebore and most of
the elm and hornbeam in
2ndary woodland.

A deer, probably fallow, 
was seen in the N.W. handle.
On the main internal bank
is an elm stool markedly elon-
gated in plan, 14 ft 10 in x c. 6 ft.
Canopy diameter 39 p. = 26.5
m.
4381
        Chadacre Park.
  Belt A contains some exotic
trees but is embanked and of
some standing.  B is an old plan-
tation, heavily thinned, with
some big pines.
  Much of the park is per-
manent but recent grassland.
Usual 19th-cent, trees; fine
cedars (atlantica, libani, deodara).
  Many of the internal hedges
appear to be long-standing
(e.g. between Jubilee Field snd
Pond Thicks (perhaps not orig-
inally internal), mixed with
mercury).
 Between Front Park and
Barn Field is a recently made
stake-&-rice fence of coppice
material.
[14382-14383]
4382
  A few free-standing pollard
oaks and one on a boundary
in the Jubilee Wood area.
Jubilee Wood is a fine
mature plantation (evidently
1887) of larch with some ash
and sycamore, evidently pre-
viously farmland.
  Thicks and Graveyard are 
otherwise ordinary grass
fields in the bottom of a 
shallow valley from which
the stream has been diverted
to flow round the N. side of
Beavin's Wood.

   A large oak pollard
 lies at the S.W. corner, having


[14388-14389]
been uprooted this winter 
from a hedge running S.
from the corner.  Pollard
branches partly dead, at
least 200 years old from
rings.  Tree probably only
slightly hollow.  Roots rather
small, to c. 9 in. dia.,
shallow; trunk ending
abruptly without a tap root.
One sector of trunk with
roots dead recently.

Features.
1. Wood bank variable; E.
side perhaps more recent
than rest (cf 1st ed. 1"),
but internal earthworks do
4389
not support this.
2. Whole interior full of irre-
gular pits and mounds.
Numerous pits with water;
margins steeply sloping, per-
haps up to 3 ft deep.  In
the S.E. corner a mound 
perhaps 60 ft dia x 8 ft high,
covered with bricks and peg roofing tiles.
Other deposits of tiles else-
where in the S.E. part.  An
apparent bank and ditch
in the N. projection may con-
tinue but is intercepted by
pits.
3.Woodland structure high-
ly irregular.  Several pollard
willows.  Ash stools few but
regularly coppiced and some

4. HORNBEAM:  one tree only
but that a maiden of ex-
ceptional size.
5. ALDER: about 6 stools by
pits, a few poles.

dens and once-cuts on the
tile mounds; others in N.W.
corner.

Interpretation.
  A remarkably complex

Must have some connexion
with primary woodland (?thro'
Chadacre Park; or is the
sinuous boundary roughly

parallel to the road the
remains of an ancient wood-
land formerly existing to the
W. of the present grove?
  The massive pits & mounds
presumably result from a 
works (18th cent. or earlier)
producing chiefly roof tiles.
Perhaps this was done by
digging up an existing cop-
pice wood of which the
few big ash stools are sur-
vivors.  Alder must be secondary.
  Coppicing must have gone
on long after the works was
abandoned.

  The Chad Brook valley has been
somewhat damaged by drainage works
in the last few months.

  Remarkably large and

  On the steep side of the

square yards with Paris forming
a carpet like mercury.  Canopy
rather dense and few plants
flowering.

Effects of present use.  [SYMBOL] 18
  About an acre on the E.
side is used for car-breaking.
Trees on site destroyed but
primroses flourish.  Little ten-
dency for this activity to
spread, and no further damage
to vegetation.
Main ride and its branch

[14414-14415]
4414
to the breaker's yard have
been widened and are used
for storing empty drums of
concentrated paint pigment ([SYMBOL]
18).  Little damage except by
fires in the drums which
have burnt some adjoining
lime and other stools.  Ride
vegetation damaged by laying
sleeper trackways.
  The rest of the wood
has a remarkably dense
network of rides, evidently
much walked in but without
any apparent damage.

       Features.
1. Striking hilltop site.
2. Charactristic wood bank,
broad and rather low, like
4415
Monks' Park;  but from the
outside it is formidable owing
to the slope of the ground
and resembles a massive 
lynchet or small hill-fort ([SYMBOL]
77).  The S. peninsula has
a similar bank cutting it
off from the rest of the
wood and also surrounding 
it on the outside.  Rounded
corners to the main embank-
ment.  North indentation has
a characteristic truncation
bank, narrow, high, and 
straight.  The rest of the
wood-bank is rather uniform
in profile save where it
carries a small parasitic 
bank to the W.
3. "Streamside meadow" to
[14416-14417]

6. Coppice stools chiefly
middle-sized to small, though

7. One boundary pollard (elm).
8. The largest area known
of mixed coppice in which
non-suckering elm is the
dominant or sub-dominant
constituent.  Probably two geno-
types mixed.
9. A conventional elm in-
vasion in the S.
10. Hornbeam strongly gregarious,
concentrated in two areas.
11. Lime much as in Brad-
field, strongly gregarious in
scattered groups of stools,
but less evidently calcifuge.

[14418-14419]
4418
Stools medium to large, low
to medium height, thus with
a similar range of stool
morphology to Bradfield. No
tendency to layer or sucker.
12. Lime-elm probably unique
(cf Hockering).
13. Lime-elm-hornbeam
unique.
14. Elm-hornbeam rare (cf
Hempstead).
15. Lime overlaps with maple.
16. Clematis rare, marginal.
17, Hawthorn mainly oxy.
18. Daphne abundant in
W. and N.W. margins (rare in
Suffolk).
19. Holly rare, marginal.
20. Broom present, near lime.
4419
21. Poplar very rare.
22. Birch and cherry appar-
ently absent.
23. Ivy carpetting a sharply
defined rectangular area
(apparently without any
earthwork at the boundary.
24. Ivy overlaps lime,
which is unique; though
the overlap is not large,
most of the lime occurring
outside the ivy area.
25. Three ponds, one very
large and regular, all evi-
dently dug out as ponds.
26. Surface somewhat irregu-
lar with shallow hollows.
27. Wet plateau in the middle
with drier slopes, although
[14420-14421]
4420
the E. slope is rather
wet, in part because of
interception by the wood bank.
28. Slight acid area in
the wettest part, probably
a sandy cap from which
springs issue.
29. Oxlip absent.
30. Excellent zonation in
response to drainage.
31. Remarkable Paris stand.
32. Ancient woodland plants:
Tilia cordata   Hyperic. hirs.
Carex remota    Mercury (Geum riv.)
(Anemone)       Malus    Viola reich.
Paris           Campan. trach.

33.  Secondary woodland plants:
4421
Ivy         Chaerophyllum
Daphne      (Hornbeam)
(but no cherry)

34. Old Helleborus record (per-
haps destroyed by car-breaking).
35. Dogwood & privet not recorded.
36. Bluebell remarkably abundant for Suffolk.
37. No Carex pendula despite habitat.
Interpretation.
  Earthworks strongly suggest
a park; the similarity to
MPW is striking.  Note the very
sinuous outine (suggesting an
existing small wood) and
rounding -off of the corners,
especially the N.W. corner
which would havw been
awkward. South peninsula
[14422-14423]
4422
[DIAG]

is inexplicable; perhaps a 2ndary 
                 emparking slightly later.
  Ponds probably dug in
connexion with park.
  Vegetation overwhelmingly
suggests primary woodland.
  Secondary woodland fea-
tures are concentratrd in the
4423
N.W., suggesting that this was
a laund, perhaps with an iso-
lated lime grove.
  Scarcity of big stools sug-
gests intensive grazing for a
period.
Northern indentation may 
be 19th-cent.

  The valley below Red-hawe
Farm has a strip of unim-
proved pasture in the bottom.
Usual rather abrupt sides

ton. has some ancient hedges
and small fields of per-
manent pasture.

  The range is similar
to that in Fakenham but
the "heavy neutral" is
4437
an intermediate type, seldom
seen covering here a consid-
erable area.
6. Elm invasion limited and
not very aggressive.
7. Dogwood, privet, hornbeam,
lime absent.
8. Recent coppice with growth
nearly as good as at Brad-
field.
9. Internal earthwork.
10. Cherry frequent along

Coppice area.
  Much of the coppice is
the invading pole elm, now
cut for the first time.  Under
these circumstances the
new growth is mainly from
stumps rather than suckers.
Reaches about the same height
as the other species.
  Note that the increase
in primroses, as got by
comparing the flowers in
plants in the coppice with
those just into the uncut
woodland, is clearly on flow-
ers per plant rather than
in numbers of plants.

Interpretation.
  Earthworks strongly suggest
a park outline similar to
Elmsett Park: the greater
part of the [!!!!] present wood is
possibly a secondary em-
parking similar to but larger
than, the one at Elmsett.
But the boundary bank is
different from the Elmsett
one and the corners are not
rounded.
  Primary woodland evi-
dence much weaker than
for Elmsett: e.g. no big
stools. Positive secondary
woodland indicators over a
considerable area.  This may
be partly due to the influ-
ence of soil type.
[14442-14443]

  Probably some continuity 
with primary woodland, but
[!!!!] disruption due to
the park phase could have
been comparatively severe.
  Absence of hornbeam is
remarkable in the circum-
stances.

  Wolve's Wood is a very
prominent object on the 
skyline from the N.
  The mere at Semer is
a round shallow lake
surrounded by reed-beds
in the valley floor.

Elm logs: c. 1000  **

Grips vegetated all across.
  This "no change" result
of coppicing appears not to have
any parallel elsewhere, it
perhaps results from the
largely 1-storeyed previous
woodland and consequent
light shade and continuous
ground vegetation.
  Fire site overgrown within
a year.
 No obvious effect of
trampling.
 Rides quite wet with
standing water in places.
Little surface water elsewhere

  The largest pollard ash
along the S. edge was about
1/4 cut in the hedge trimming
last year and has put on
some new pollard shoots about
2 ft long.
  Oxlips now past the best.
No evidence of damage except
some flowers nipped off in the 
N.E. of the wood.
  The elms cut in 1970 have
regenerated from the stump
and not by suckers, although
they appear to be nearly all
of sucker origin.
  The blackthorn thicket in the
N.W. of the wood is moribund.
