        Features.
1. Slope site with stream at
bottom.  Originally there was 
probably a meadow between
the wood and the stream, the
4347
latter being later diver-
ted to its present
course, which    [DIAG]
is not quite      ORIGINAL
along the bottom  SITUATION
of the valley.
2. Massive sinuous bank all
round.
3. No internal earthworks save
one or two pits.
4. Internal valley at S.E. corner.
5. Numerous "black holes" of
the shallow Hayley type on
the S. side.
6. Boundary pollards include
several huge and remarkably
complex elms.  Most of the
latter have been pollarded
at two differnbet levels, probably
with a long interval between

(p. 4339).
Height i
          [DIAG]
COMPLEX ELM
POLLARD
That of p. 4338
has in addition an exposed
root bearing suckers.
7. Probably in the last century 
a 3-storeyed wood (apart from
the elm areas) with sparse LC
and very few standards.  Most
of the standards since felled.
Much of the wood is now
single coppice of pure hazel.
8. Ash rarer than in any other
BC wood save Hockering.
9. Complex elm situation with
6 elm areas.  That in the S.E.
4349
corner is an aggressive suckerer
and displaces other woodland.
That of p. 4334, and probably
of p. 4335, consist mainly
of stools but sucker weakly.
That in the S. boundary
appears to be a glabra hy-
brid, suckering rather less weakly.
That of p. 4340 is probably
pure glabra.,  There
are at least two overlaps
of elm areas, both probably 
of the coexistence type.
Such complexity is remarkable
for a small wood.
10. ALDER present.
11. SALIX FRAGILIS present
(2 maidens and 2 big stools)
12. Small internal fen valley
with the above two grees - al-

[14350-14351]
4350
most unique oin BC woodland.
13. No aspen.
14. 22 native trees & shrubs.
15. One hornbeam.
16 Small apparently neutral
area (mainly coniferized) (Ane-
mone). Probably a little gravel
cap; surrounded by a wet
area.  no definite calcifuges.
17. Oxlip very abundant in
a small part of the wood.
18. Bluebell rare.
19. ADOXA abundant, often 
50% cover, on nearly half the 
E. wood-bank.
20 Campanula trachelium frequent
in open areas and marginal.
21. Large Allium area.
22. Carex riparia rare.
23. Despite the scarcity of mature
4351
oaks, spome natural regeneration
goes on.
24. Fine standard crab.
