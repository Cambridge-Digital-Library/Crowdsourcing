BRADFIELD WOODS.
3 July [SYMBOL]
Most barley and wheat
crops between Cambridge & Bury
are in good condition; some,
most or all on sand & gravel
in the Kennett-Risby area,
have markedly sparse ears or
early senescence. Failure
of ear emergence noted once.
In the angle between the 
Ely and Cambridge lines east 
of Newmarket is a small
larch plantation of perhaps 30
years' growth. About a sixth of
the trees have died after
leafing this year.

5 July. Breckland, with D.E. Coombe.
Elm Disease.
Kennett. About 15% of elms
along main toad have symptoms,
nearly all slight. Mainly in
bigger trees. Carpinif.
Barton Mills. About 10% with
symptoms, mainly slight. Carpin.
Barley at Grime's Graves.
Chalk stripes.
Height normal, about 2/3 of
ears fully emerged and rest
partly emerged. Leaves normal,
big flag leaf, 2 1/2 leaves per
stem still green. No senescence
of stems or {????] [SYMBOL] 28
Normal sand stripes
[17170-17171]
Crop appreciably shorter,
ears at most half emerged,
mainly coming out sideways,
leaves about the same size,
normally 2-2 1/2 still green,
[????] about 1/3 yellow, stems
nearly all green. Tiller den-
sity abut 1/2 of that in
chalky stripes. Rabbit
damage apparently commoner
stems & ears eaten off. [SYMBOL]29
Extreme drought in some of
the stripes has crop shorter
still, no ears emerged,
leaves all yellowish, tillers
even fewer.  [SYMBOL]30

 Innumerable tiny frogs
 c.1/2" long in the Ranunculus

Ringmere. Zones very similar. Simi-
lar population of little frogs.
The water-level in the [????]

Seveb Tree Road near Dead Men's
Grave, Icklingham
Visited in the late afternoon. A
very quiet part of the Breckland,
on the Elveden Estate.
There are about 100 acres of
open heath around 781744.
The area swarms with rabbits
: about 150 were counted without 
difficulty in 1/4 hour. Few burrows
seen. One myxomatous individual.
The heath is the site of flint
mines, which appear as conical pits
Limes by roadside 890903.
Small avenue. Trees about 30ft
high. Tilia? platyphyllus. Almost
totally defoliated, apparently by
caterpillars, and now growing new
