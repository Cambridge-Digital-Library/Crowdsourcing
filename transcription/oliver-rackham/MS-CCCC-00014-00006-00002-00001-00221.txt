BRADFIELD WOODS.
3 July [SYMBOL]
Most barley and wheat
crops between Cambridge & Bury
are in good condition; some,
most or all on sand & gravel
in the Kennett-Risby area,
have markedly sparse ears or
early senescence. Failure
of ear emergence noted once.
In the angle between the 
Ely and Cambridge lines east 
of Newmarket is a small
larch plantation of perhaps 30
years' growth. About a sixth of
the trees have died after
leafing this year.

5 July. Breckland, with D.E. Coombe.
Elm Disease.
Kennett. About 15% of elms
along main toad have symptoms,
nearly all slight. Mainly in
bigger trees. Carpinif.
Barton Mills. About 10% with
symptoms, mainly slight. Carpin.
Barley at Grime's Graves.
Chalk stripes.
Height normal, about 2/3 of
ears fully emerged and rest
partly emerged. Leaves normal,
big flag leaf, 2 1/2 leaves per
stem still green. No senescence
of stems or {????] [SYMBOL] 28
Normal sand stripes
[17170-17171]
Crop appreciably shorter,
ears at most half emerged,
mainly coming out sideways,
leaves about the same size,
normally 2-2 1/2 still green,
[????] about 1/3 yellow, stems
nearly all green. Tiller den-
sity abut 1/2 of that in
chalky stripes. Rabbit
damage apparently commoner
stems & ears eaten off. [SYMBOL]29
Extreme drought in some of
the stripes has crop shorter
still, no ears emerged,
leaves all yellowish, tillers
even fewer.  [SYMBOL]30
No sign whatever of late
tillers.
Devil's Punchbowl.
Water has now submerged the
Schoenoplectus & gone well
beyond it to the foot of the
steep slopes of the sides.
Up to the base of the dead
pines on the N.E. side.
Water has just reched base of
2 oaks, which are healthy.

 Innumerable tiny frogs
 c.1/2" long in the Ranunculus
 zone. Difficult to avoid treading    
[17172-17173]
on them.
Ringmere. Zones very similar. Simi-
lar population of little frogs.
The water-level in the [????]
pit by the roadside is unchanged.
Seven Tree Road near Dead Men's
Grave, Icklingham
Limes by roadside 890903.
Small avenue. Trees about 30ft
high. Tilia? platyphyllus. Almost
totally defoliated, apparently by
caterpillars, and now growing new
leaves.
[SYMBOL]
Visited in the late afternoon. A
very quiet part of the Breckland,
on the Elveden Estate.
There are about 100 acres of
open heath around 781744.
The area swarms with rabbits
: about 150 were counted without 
difficulty in 1/4 hour. Few burrows
seen. One myxomatous individual.
The heath is the site of flint
mines, which appear as conical pits
c.15ft dia., surrounded by spoil-
heaps. The heath in general
would be Grasslands B-D, but 
the pits and heaps have formed 
large patches of Grassland A.
The rabbits have eaten down the
turf to about 1/2" high: the classic
scene of In Breckland Wilds. Large
numbers of gorse and a few
broom bushes, dating from before the
increase of rabbits, have been
eaten into mushroom shapes.
The area is crossed by many
baulks and other shallow features.
[17174-17175]
Some of those have stumps ap-
parently remaining from former
tree-belts. Several belts and clumps 
of pines remain in more or less
decrepitude.
Stripes cover part of the area,
running up-&-down slope. Clearly
visible ([SYMBOL]4) but apparently due
merely to slight changes in the den-
ity of Agrostis inflorenscences.
Rabbits have got into an ad-
jacent barley field through gaps
in the fence and have totally 
eaten out semicircular patches
of up to nearly an acre, exten-
ding slightly further into the more
droughted parts of the crop. [SYMBOL]6
6 July.
Leckhampton horsechestnuts.
4 felled about a week ago.
[SYMBOL] Wetwood insignificant.
Phytophthera: 2-3 lesions
of this type. [SYMBOL]7,8
[DIAG]
This one about 15-20ft
up in the slender trunk. Probably
results from a strip about 1"
wide of cambium dying and
lesion spreading sideways after
partial healing-over had taken
place.
[17176-17177]
Another lesion.
[DIAG]
[SYMBOL] Slight wetwood in base,
not reaching outside of tree,
nor extending more than a few
feet up.
Only two tangential fis-
sures noted, in lower trunk
[SYMBOL] Extensive wetwood through-
out; probably squamosus ex-
tending down from hollow top,
? 64 rings at 10ft up.
HAYLEY WOOD DED.
7 July.
Forest Pathology Group.
Discussed problems of stump
infection in plantations near Snake
Wood. To prevent this trouble, the
FC has now taken to digging 
out the stumps of felled planta-
tions with a "tooth-pick", a hydrau-
lically-operated spike attached to 
a digger.
Demonstrated Lavenham. Prob-
lems of timber-supply in medieval
Suffolk towns.
Sedum acre is flowering excep-
tionally well this year. Abundant
on the roofs of Lavenham. Grows on
old peg-tiles. Sometimes grows in
great masses in neglected gutters
but is not specially characteristic
[17178-17179]
of such.
Chadacre
House not older than the 28th
cent.; contains a simulated medieval
hall.
Park contains some great elms
of various species, and a very few
pollard oaks, but is probably not
ancient.
Rivett's Hall is demolished; the
19th-cent. farm buildings remain.
The field to the S.E., called Cross-
ways, contains several ponds, part
of the Rivett's Hall moat, and other
earthworks; it is permanent grass.
Various elms around Rivett's Hall
and Crossways, including some rather
peNdulous small-leaved sorts.
8 July. CHADACRE AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE
Armillaria site in oak
plantation, West Haling.
Planted 1933 an arable field
on sand, surrounded by belts.
Much bracken & bramble.
Ivy low down in big patches.

Oaks rather uniform, crooked
with sparsetro frequent epi-
cormics.

Replacement by various ba-
sidiomycetes including Phlebia
merismoides (with caveman
club hyphae), Phanerochaete
velutina = Peniophora vel. (very
thick hyphae, whorled clamp
connexions), Phallus impudicus
(vesicles with crystals inside).
Phanerochaete forms mycelian
sheet & strands; Phallus is
also a strand-invader. They
vigorously invade stumps killed
with sulphamate.
Phlebia vigorously invades
sulphamated oak stumps, and
is much commoner than  on living
oak stumps. It goes for the
unter tissues.
Mycelia of Phlebia and other
wood-rotters [!!!!]occur[!!!!] form in a system 
of compartments mildly antag-
onistic to each other; the 
spaces between compartments 
[17182-17183]
are not rotted and are
occupied by dematiaceous 
Hyphomycetes.
J. Rishbeth demonstrated the
process of identifying individual
Armillaria mycelia by using
cultural morphology. Only a small 
part of the plantation is yet inva-
ded. With one exception, all the
colonies are of one genotype
each. A more extensive invasion,
of several genotypes, is extending
from the Long Belt.
Mycelia are cultured from sam-
plas of rhizomorphs.

Bavin's Wood
The Hartest portion, where the
tall oaks and sparse underwood
were, has been felled and planted
with conifers. Underwood mostly
survives but regrowth poor.
The elms at the S.E. are intact,
as are the great oaks on the
N.W. boundary of this part of
the wood.
The coppice part of the wood
is intact, but there seems not
to have been any recent
coppicing.

The "butterfly" is a figure in
the grain of a particularly highly-
prized kind of willow.
Watermark disease causes un-
acceptable discolouration. Affected
logs sometimes find their way to
eastern countries and are there
made into toy bats which are 
sold in Britain.
Spltting is done by strong
men with mallets and wedges. The
clefts are trimmed to size with
circular saws. After kiln-drying
they are packed in big cartons
for export.

In the garden of Pirnhow

Exactly like T. cordata in infls,

there are extensive bat-willow
plantations grown under contract
to Messrs Watts. Land is gravel

Two infected trees seen. Branch-

thorns and a lime - in 
Riverside Road at the bottom
of Aspland Road have died
in the last few months.
A considerable tidal cur-
rent up-river at Riverside
Road.
The grass at Harvey lane
is in relatively good condition,
except for Holcus mollis which
gives rise to small whitish
patches because it has abundant 
dead leaves.
Senecio jacobaea still
present in the back lawn.
A considerable area of
the verge on the N. side of Morse
Avenue is being dug up
- it smnells anaerobic with
the same acid smell as
we observed in the front 
garden after the escape of gas.
One large plant of Verbascum 
pulverulentum at the back of
Laurence & Scott's - the remaining
area where this plant occurred
has been grassed. About 25

station & the railway and on
