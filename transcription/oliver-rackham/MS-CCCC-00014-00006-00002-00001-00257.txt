About 15 trees seen. Most multi-

a limestone fissure. Stems are
otherwise up to 4 in. thick. Max
height 20-25 ft. Probably growing
quite fast. Most of these trees
seem ti have been coppiced, tho'
somwqre veery inaccessible.
   Lime is more esten by goats
than any other sp. except Rhus [!!!!tere]

Other trees ee partially bitten

pink.     macrorhizum
Clematis vitalba is common 
[19880=19881]
9880
in the woods around 800 m.,
usually climbing over Abies.
[19882-19883]

Identity of tilia. Appears to be
T. rubra. Leaves firmer than
platyphyllos but less firm than
cordata, very like cordata in upper
half but often obliquely trun-
catde below, twigs glabrous, infl.
pendulous. Leaf-teeth definitely
aristate.

Lonicera prob. xylosteum, is
abundant in the Tilia cliffs.

The local hawthorn appears
to be Cretaegus pentagyne.

Quercus cerris is possibly
present with other oaks on
9881
Zagora. Leaves small, deeply
lobed, with awned points.
The rarest of the oaks.

The oak here provisionally
identified as Q. brachyphylla
was seen as a hedgerow tree
at c. 500 m., in the Valley of
the Muses. Small tree c. 30 ft
high, rounded crown.

Treatment.
  Cliff Slaughter met  a man
who said he had cut wood on
the mountain up to 30 years
ago. This was mainly for fuel
and ceased because if alter-
native fuels.
   There is a tradition that
all the mountain above the
[19882=19883]
olive-limit was burned by
the Germans in 1943-5 to
suppress partisans. This cannot
be lteraily true but may ex-
plain the extensive fires.

[DIAG]

Plateau

Cliffs. Form a line of broken
cliffs, but with precipices up to
c. 1900 ft high, facing N.. ex-
tending from the fen B to the
saddle E. The limestone is wea-
thered into razor-edged pinna-
9883
cles. Little loose rock.
   Lime occurs throughout the
cliffs. Most other trees are best
developed st the W. end, ex-
cept for Rhus which is mainly
in the middle.
Tilia and Fraxinus are con-
fined to cliffs. Rhus and Os-
trya and Acer occur (Rhus
and Ostrya very bitten-down)
on broken rock slopes several
hungred ,m. above (p. 9877).
Evigently the zone  now occu-
pied by Quercus coccif. and
Abies would support deciduous
trees but for the grazing.

Abies. Occurs from 600 to
1450 m. The 130-yeqr-old tree
of p. 9876 was one of a group
[19884-19885]
9884
of venerable appearance, the
oldest-looking seen.
   Much of the upper moun-
tain is a near-desert of loose
scree, with the charred stumps 
of Abies. These were mostly
sawn off c. 5 ft high either
before or after burning. They
appear slightly less decayed
than those around Koyo Pi-
gadhi.
   Strips of Abies woodland
survive mainly on ridges. The
slopes are very steep and the
rocks almost as bsre of vege-
tation as on the burnt area.
   Abies does grow from seed;
even in the burnt area there
are pockets of fine material
with Abies saplings. These are
9885
eaten down into a very flat
cone (p. 9875) but after many
years they put on a leader.

Helleborus cyclopbyllus. Freq. at
all altitudes, esp. with Abies.

Ufrtica dioica. Freq. on cliffs and
on ridge above.

   The highest point reached
was at the edge of the complex
kaarst which forms rthe summit
plarteau. A flock of sheep, in  bad
condition, asleep in the sun under
a small grove of firs at the
edge of the first decline.

Campanula. A large plant with con-
spicuous pale-blue flowers in
[19886-19887]
9886
spikes freq. on cliffs. Copious latex.

Livestock. Sheep high on Zgora.
A woman seen with several hundred
beautiful silver-grey goats at
the top of the Valley of the Muses.
Very expert at hurrying along strag-
glers by throwing stones. Several
dozen cattle in valley below the 
fen B.

   This is typical of the 
small ravines in the Pleistocene
conglomerates below 350 m. alt.
Soils mainly cacareous.
9889
   Hypericum triquetrifolium
= crispum is one of the
commonest weeds in the area.
   Plumbago europea is s 
common plant of roadsides and
the more fertile kinds of garrigue.

   This area is on a very
steep W. facing slope, too steep
to cultivate. At the bottom is
a dried-up stream-bed, prob.
with only occasional water in
the rainy season, with no spe-
cial vegetstion.
   The tortoise was blunder-
ing about noisily in the mid-
afternoon. It moved about
as fast as Nicky on a very
hot day.
[19890-19891]
9890
Grazing of stubbles.
   Mainly by flocks of sheep
in the Thebes plain; by te-
thered horses etc on thr plat-
eau. Some stubble has been
burnt ad the land plowed;
this is only possible on the 
plains, where spray-irrigation
makes it possible to grow an
autumn crop of potatoes.
   According to Clifford Slaugh-
ter, sheep are grazed by ar-
rangement with the landown-
ers. There are a few parcels
of privately-owned land which
are used only as pasture.
