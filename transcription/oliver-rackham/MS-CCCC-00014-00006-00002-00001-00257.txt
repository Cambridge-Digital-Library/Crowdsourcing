About 15 trees seen. Most multi-
stemmed, but one single-stemmed;
thislast c. " thick, growing out of

a limestone fissure. Stems are
otherwise up to 4 in. thick. Max
height 20-25 ft. Probably growing
quite fast. Most of these trees
seem ti have been coppiced, tho'
somwqre veery inaccessible.
   Lime is more esten by goats
than any other sp. except Rhus [!!!!tere]
[!!!!binth];several trees sre eaten
right down though not killed.
Other trees ee partially bitten
off [!!!!] by goats reaching out
from a nearby ledge.
Trees are abundantly fertile but
not flowering now.
They vary donsiderabky in leaf
size and tomeentum and in
date of fruiting.

A splendid Geranium abun-

cliffs resembles Geranium lucidum
but is very [????] pubescent,
with deeply-divided leaves, flowers
very large, petals 12-13 mm,deep
pink.     macrorhizum
Clematis vitalba is common 
[19880=19881]
9880
in the woods around 800 m.,
usually climbing over Abies.
[19882-19883]

Identity of tilia. Appears to be
T. rubra. Leaves firmer than
platyphyllos but less firm than
cordata, very like cordata in upper
half but often obliquely trun-
catde below, twigs glabrous, infl.
pendulous. Leaf-teeth definitely
aristate.

Lonicera prob. xylosteum, is
abundant in the Tilia cliffs.

The local hawthorn appears
to be Cretaegus pentagyne.

Quercus cerris is possibly
present with other oaks on
9881
Zagora. Leaves small, deeply
lobed, with awned points.
The rarest of the oaks.

The oak here provisionally
identified as Q. brachyphylla
was seen as a hedgerow tree
at c. 500 m., in the Valley of
the Muses. Small tree c. 30 ft
high, rounded crown.

Treatment.
  Cliff Slaughter met  a man
who said he had cut wood on
the mountain up to 30 years
ago. This was mainly for fuel
and ceased because if alter-
native fuels.
   There is a tradition that
all the mountain above the
[19882=19883]
olive-limit was burned by
the Germans in 1943-5 to
suppress partisans. This cannot
be lteraily true but may ex-
plain the extensive fires.

[DIAG]

Plateau

Cliffs. Form a line of broken
cliffs, but with precipices up to
c. 1900 ft high, facing N.. ex-
tending from the fen B to the
saddle E. The limestone is wea-
thered into razor-edged pinna-
9883
cles. Little loose rock.
   Lime occurs throughout the
cliffs. Most other trees are best
developed st the W. end, ex-
cept for Rhus which is mainly
in the middle.
Tilia and Fraxinus are con-
fined to cliffs. Rhus and Os-
trya and Acer occur (Rhus
and Ostrya very bitten-down)
on broken rock slopes several
hungred ,m. above (p. 9877).
Evigently the zone  now occu-
pied by Quercus coccif. and
Abies would support deciduous
trees but for the grazing.

Abies. Occurs from 600 to
1450 m. The 130-yeqr-old tree
of p. 9876 was one of a group
