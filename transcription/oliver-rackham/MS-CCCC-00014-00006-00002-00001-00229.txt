Gué l'Eveque is a lake formed
by damming a broad valley.
Now wholly dry, save for wet
patches where springs apparently
ooze through the sides. The
bottom of the arms is  sand but
that of the main lake is mud,


[17778-17779]

which has dried out completely
to a depth of some 6" and less
completely below that depth. In
drying it shrinks by nearly half
and forms these polygons separ-
ated by wide cracks. The mud
beneath being still elastic the
polygons are not rigid, but
can just be walked in. A belt
of tide-line vegetation occurs
about 1½" down each crack.
This includes Juncus bufonius, J.?articulatus. anceps
More sandy parts of the lake
have abundant stet [!!!!]Littorella[!!!!] [!!!!] (occurs
sparingly on mud) and a tiny 
Eleocharis (?soloniensis) [SYMBOL].
The densely-hairy form (var.
villosa) of Veronica scutellata

occurs here.
Peucedanum
gallicum - dry
grassland.
FORET D'ORLEANS - 2 cards.
Animals seen.
White Admiral - 2-3 in rides 
near Gué l'Évêque.
Red deer - one hind near
Carref. de Sully
Slowworm. One among longish
grass on little-used ride
(Route du Briou?) Sluggish in
its movements. About 1ft long.
Uniform brown colour. When 
released it disappeared with
ease.
Between L[????] and Gué 
l'Évêque is a tract of scattered
[17780-17781]
7780
farmhouses in hedgeless fields.
The edge of the Forest is a 
complex alternation of fields
and pine plantations.
Similar scattered farms and
hedgeless fields in the big
assart N. of Ou[????].
La Champagne
A very diffuse wood, or
group of woods, with edges
of small pioneer oaks encroa-
ching on grassland. The more
established areas consist of
standard oaks with no
underwood. Pine colonization
in places, from planted stands.
Frequent invasion by Robinia.
Cherry occasional.

7781
Mistletoe occasionally
grows on Robinia.
St Benoit-Bray-en-Val-
Les Bordes - Carref. de Sully - L[????]
- Gué l'Évêque - Marchais-Mignon
- O[????]ouer - St Père - St B.
The Forest suffers much
less from drought than the suf-
rounding countryside. Chief 
symptoms round the Étang and
especially on the peninsula,
where sallow is largely defoliated
and [!!!!] birch and smaller
oaks are partly withered.

[17782-17783]
7782
A forest fire between
Les Bordes and O[????] has
consumed several acres of
polesized pine and Robinia.
Scorched trees across the road
but did not jump the road..
Maize suffers badly from 
drought. Leaves remain green but
curl up sideways. LAI and
cover much reduced - cover
c. 30%.
[!!!!]

7783
DED. Les Bordes rare.
Nogent sur Vernisson 6% severe
to dead, much recent infect[????]
not yet far advannced.
Nemours area. 10%.
Combs-La-Ville nearly 100%.
Fontainebleau. Now 95% of
trees >12ft high. Most of the 
remaining big trees in the Park
are severely infected this year.
Killing has gone on for at
least 3 years. Severe killing
of polesized elms round the 
boundary of Forest and town.
Cucubalus baccifer. Fontaine-
bleau Park, on site of felled
elm grove.

[17784-17785]

Crops in the Loire valley
are (in descending order) wheat, maize,
oats, sugarbeet, barley, rye. About 
¾ of the nonwoodland is arable,
of which some 20% is fallow.
Small vineyard at Les Bordes
- no others seen.
Woods between O[????] & [????]
pierre.
Almost pure oak, chiefly
[????] p[????]. Occ. [????] [????] [????].
Bracken. Traces of oak[????] [????].
Ash occurs abundantly in
hedges along the N152. Much
wilted.
Woods at Les N[????] St Y[????]

7785
Much u/w survives. Some
hazel. Alder by stream
(not seen elsewhere). ?Lime.
Roadside chestnuts suffering
severely from drought.
Vineyard at N[????].
Oaks on roadsides suffer
more from drought than those
in established woods, which
merely show a reduced LAI and 
some brown leaves. Young oaks in
secondary woodland are the worst
affected, often being wholly withered
and brown.
