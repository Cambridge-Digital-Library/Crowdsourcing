13" Stump on one of the walls

Sallow 97 girth
Wall to W. of track of huge
boulders in 2 courses
  The wall from 793205
to 795201 may be the boundary

[12950-12951]
2950
between Trebaweth and Trevean
(not necessarily).  Type decribed on
p. 2948 with other kinds of wall
abutting on it.
  Trebaweth is a large farm
with massive stone buildings of
indeterminate age.
  From Trebaweth to the sea
is a curious lane probably of
great antiquity between walls
of various types, some of them
megalithic.  In its northern part
it is double (as on previous page).
Ashes and elms of various
sizes grow on the walls.
By one of the walls is a 
huge sallow (previous page).
  E. of this lane is a small
area of [!!!!ash] wood, mainly sallow 
2951
and Prunus;  part of a complex series
of wood, scrub, and heath, extending
to the sea around the S. end of
the track.  Small areas of improved
grassland on the 25 ft raised beach.
  Between the lane and the 
Grove is a similar mixture of
heathland types to that further W.
  At 792192 is a ruined building
or tiny very massive enclosure
right on the cliff and partly
fallen in the sea.
  Fires have been very serious,
especially immediately E. of
The Grove and a large tract to
the W. The Grove itself is ap-
parently undamaged.
  N. of St Keverne is a valley
full of sallow woods looking

[12952-12953]
2952
from a distance very like Main
Dale.

[Kennack, cont. from p. 2944.]
These form roughly the boundary
of the two elms.  The presence
of Ruscus is curious.
On the way to Trevenwith
is an arable field with Antho-
ccros and other notable bryophytes.

April 8.
  There was a quite severe frost
during the night.
Degibna Wood, Kelston, is
mainly oak.
  In Sithney there are several
small woods of Ulmus hollandica
developing around small wet
enclosures with megalithic walls.
  St Michael's Mount is a
granite outcrop with characteristic
weathered cliffs and piled boul-
ders on the seaward side.
  Cynodon was found at
Marazion by the railway station.
In its winter state it is bleached
abd shows little sign of life.
The rhizome much resembles 
Agropyron junceiforme, differing

[12954-12955]
2954
in its smaller size, hairiness,
and lack of red pigment.  Leaf
bases in untidy tufts at intervals
marking the short shoots.  It
grows in the most seaward part
of the dunes where this is compacted
by treading and wave action.
  The fen at Marazion con-
sists mainly of Phragmites.  No
swallows seen.
  Sibthorpia at Canopus was
hard to find, but flourishes in
two patches about 20 yrds
upstream from the road.  On the
earthen sides of a wall,
facing N.E.
in light shade

          Granite rocks

          edge by Pol-
   ostock Zawn, weathered 
into mushroom shapes.

Hypoglossum was found in

[DIAG]


[12956-12957]
2956
a pool at extreme low water.
In small groups.  Much re-
sembles Delesseria, but it is
very thin, of filmy consistency,
and flexible though fairly tough.
Deep cherry-red colour.  Under
a hand-lens it is seen to be
one cell thick, composed of
chains of cells in a bipinnate
arrangement.  It looks paren-
chymatous.  Cells just visible
with the naked eye.  Not in
shade.
  In shallow rainwater pools
in the spray zone at Hella
Point.  Numerous small black
hemispheres, c. 5 mm dia., of
gelatinous-corky consistency.
2957
Under the microscope they consist
of Scytonema-like filaments
with heterocysts.
  The granite around Polostock
Zawn is strongly cuboidally
jointed, mainly in vertical planes.
It weathers into deep chimneys
and tall pinnacles,[SYMBOL] 5,8  some of
the latter mushroom-shaped.
The chimneys are filled with
softer deposits which are
more or less eroded out.  Some
of this material is in situ
but most is evidently head
deposited in grykes  
in an earlier phase.
 The granite contains large
and elegant phenocrysts.  A few
doloritic dykes.  Frequent xeno-
[12958-12959]
2958
liths of metamorphic rock.
These are sharply defined
boulders commonly 1 ft dia.
with rounded corners  of a 
finer texture and darker
colour than the granite.  The
xenoliths weather at the
same rste as the granite.
They often contain large
phenocrysts identical with those
in the granite and evidently
formed inside the inclusion.
  The phenocrysts often have
an oriented direction indicating
flow lines in the molten granite
(not usually related to the wea-
thering planes).  In one case
a large xenolith sectioned in
a cliff was seen to have
2959
flow lines going round it as
well as phenocrysts inside [SYMBOL] 10
  The Chair Ladder 
is a spectacular
pinnacle of cuboidal   [DIAG]
blocks about 15 ft
square more or less
weathered out and
forming a stack
on top of one another.
  Fine quartz           [SYMBOL] 13
crystals, up to c. 1/4 in. side,
occur in lenticular masses in
the granite. [SYMBOL] 4
  Tol-pedn-penwith is a
collapsed cavern formed inside
a very thick quartzite vein
which is nearly vertical.  It
has two entrances at sea.

level, one along the vein,
the other at right angles to
it.  [SYMBOL] 12.
  Around Tol Pedn Penwith
there is a colony of kitti-
wakes which appear to nest
in the ogo.  They flew around
inside the Mole uttering loud
mournful mewing cries which
gave a most sinister impression.
  Scilla verna is flowering
on the S. facing slopes near
Tol Pedn Penwith, but all the
open flowers appear to be
smutted.
  On the S.W. facing slope of 
a small hanging valley be-
tween Carn Guthensbras and
Porth Loe is a fairy ring
2961
some 100 ft dia. in dense
Festuca rubra turf.  See p. 2963.
  The stacks of the Gwennap
peninsula do not have any
beets or mallows, doubtless be-
cause of lack of soil.
  A seal was seen swim-
ming around and apparently
playing in Porth Loe.
  At the head of Porth Loe is
a small Phragmites-Sphagnum 
fen.
  The building on the S.
side of the road at Porth-
gwarra, shown on the O.S. at
3681/22181/2, is a small shed
or hut long roofless, built of
great granite blocks with
several orthostats at the door

[12962-12963]
2962
jambs and forming the lower
part of the walls [SYMBOL] 16.

  The road from Polgigga
to Porthgwarra is bounded 
by walls of various types but
especially the "tombstone" type
of orthostats alone.  Several 
megalithic buildings including
a megalithic privy in front of 
th house 370223.

  The succession on the Porth-
gwarra boulder (p. 07837, 136)
appears now to have much
less Teloschistes than in 1956.
Sedum acre appears to be
a successor to Sphaenophorus.
[SYMBOL] 11.
2963
  On a slope N.W. of Tol-
pedn-penwith is an annular
patch of dark green Festuca
rubra about 30 yards across, 
with a sharp edge and less
vigorous growth inside.  Either a
fairy ring or an unusually
vigorous clone.  Probably on deep
head. [SYMBOL] 14.
  In the cliffs round the head
of Porth Loe are curious "wood-
louse" formations
of double vertical  [DIAG]
rows of granite
blocks being
weathered out
of the face.  In
these cliffs are blocks in all
stages of detachment, and the

[12964-12965]
2964
beach is composed of water-roun-
ded pebbles mostly between
3 and 6 ft diam. [SYMBOL] 15.

  Carn Galver has been badly
burnt again.

       Zennor.
  A few megalithic walls built 
into houses in the church-town.
  A brief visit was made to
Zennor Head.  This is one 
of a series of headlands of
sedimentary and metamorphic 
rocks (greenstone).  They form
rugged and irregular cliffs,
without the weathering regu-
larity of the granite, and
are connected by necks to the
2965
granite of the main land-mass.
Pendour cove W. of Zennor
Head is entirely surrounded by 
such cliffs, here precipitous and
slabby and quite inaccessible.
  The road from Zennor
to Zennor Head runs between
stone hedges c. 6 ft high, usu-
ally of a single row of huge
boulders presenting a flattened
face to the road, with levelling
up blocks and sometimes a few
cubical courses on top. [SYMBOL] 20,21.
The course of these walls
is zigzag and irregular and
there are several triangular
areas between the wall and 
the road.
  Field walls on the N.E.

[12966-12967]
2966
side of the Pendower valley
are variable but often of the
same type: [SYMBOL] 22.
  The N.E. wall alongside
the road is mainly of the
megalithic type just described;
the S.W. wall contains stretches
of other types and is perhaps
later.
  The S.W. side of Pendower
valley, clearly visible from the
road, has a system of small
irregularly square fields, often
overgrown and not visible.  A few
very tiny fields (sheep-folds?) are
overgrown with scrub.  This field
system runs to the cliff edge
and the bottom of the valley.

[DIAG]

[12970-12971]
2970
the subdivision walls abut-
ting against it.
  A prominent earth track
runs across the area, disused
at least since Predannack
airfield was made.  The
ground is deeply scored by par-
allel ruts.  They run across
both tall and short heath.
On short they do not make
much difference to the species
present, but Molinia assumes
dominance.  They are often
associated with Erica vagans
in tall.
  There are two pools in
the boundary stream.  One
by the W. compoartment is
made by damming for cattle
2971
in the field to the N.E. to
drink from.  Another is just
below the ford at the S.E.
There is documentary evidence
for a mill pool somewhere
here.  This pool is almost
silted up and full of aquatic
vegetation.
  The site, especially the
N. compartment, is sporadically
grazed by trespassing cattle.
It is remarkably free from
recent burning.

  The site is approached
by a series of little used cart
tracks (now very wet). The main
cart track is a bridle road
(a suggestion that bicycles
[12972-12973]
2972
might lawfully be ridden over
the ford resulted in some
mirth).
  The croft Grochall is an
inhabited farm and all its
fields save the westernmost
are improved grass, though 
with very large tree-grown
hedges especially round the
perimeter.

Edges quite well defined. No 
corresponding mound or bank.

  Course of the eastern
stream marked by a complex
series of semi-aquatic com-
munities, including some with
Typha and [!!!!many] several woody.
  No trace of ploughing.
  This area is very long
unburnt, with poorly developed
erosion hollows in the short
heath.  A possible site for
Lycopodium selago though
none could be found.

West Compartment.
  Tall and short heath

[12974-12975]
2974
intermixed in complex streaks
with a N.E.-S.W. tendency.
Various intermediate commu-
nities.  Ploughing ridges visible
in places, suggesting that the
streaks are modified by plough-
ing from normal short heath.

Middle Compartment.
  Streaks more pronounced
than in West.

East Compartment.
  Walled off from the stream,
as far as can be told (unlike
North & South).  Large gap in the
boundary at the S. end ap-
pears to be real.
  The internal bank is ap-
parently earthern.
2975
  Contains a barrow and
several small tor-like out-
crops.
  Thickets of Ulex europaens
along the stream.  Other
woody communities (Salix and
Prunus scrub) in the stream
bed.
  Neither sub-compartment
shows any sign of ploughing.

South Compartment.
  Consists of a well-defined
plateau and a S. facing
slope, rocky in parts and
with two small quarries at
the base.  Flushes arise at
the top of this slope.  Below
the slope is a strip of flat
land by the  stream.

[12976-12977]
2976
  The stone row in the E.
is not connected to any other
earthwork.  The boundary stones
in it are almost certainly 
later.
  Short and tall heath on
the plateau.  Juncus mariti-
mus, scattered elsewhere on
the site, is abundant in
parts of the edge of the pla-
teau.  The rock slope con-
tains areas of mixed heath
and also broad flushes with
almost pure Schoenus (evi-
dently a variant of tall heath).
Rock heath is found only
in a few square yards in the
S. corner.

Great Wall of Erisey.
  The boundary wall between
the Erisey system and Goonhilly
Downs is a rather low
earthen bank of varying pro-
file, ditched towards the
Downs and sometimes on the 
inside as well.  Except where
they have been recently ploughed
up, the fields inside are 
little different from the open 
heath.
  There are traces of at
least one outer intake, not
shown on the 21/2 in. map and
now long abandoned, between
the Great Wall and the multiple
tracks of the Kuggar road.

"Funnel" joining North and
South compartments

  North and South com-
partments are probably 
unenclosed heath:  the banks
of enclosures appear generally
to be ditched on the heath
side.  The stone row perhaps
commemorates a dispute over
ownership of South compartment.
East compartment is an

enclosure, never cultivated.
The internal division could be
an earlier enclosure now
abandoned.
  West and Middle compart-
ments are enclosures formerly
ploughed perhaps as part of
the Predannack Wolles croft
system.  They are now secondary
heathland which has recovered
much of the floristic compo-
sition of the ancient heath,
though it has been permanently
altered pedologically.
  The pool in North Com-
partment is perhaps a natural
one, which could not be included
in an enclosure.

Conversation with the owner of
the "free" car-park at the 
    Lizard.
An old man living in a
bungalow with a small croft
on the edge of Lizard Downs.
Related to the inhabitants of
Grochall.  Spoke in Cornish
dialect with many words of
the ancient speech.  According
to D.E.C. much of what he 
said was influenced by
book-learning.
  He had himself cut much
turf on "the moors", using a
turf parrett (which he produced:
an instrument like an adze,
with one blade about 6 in.
3001
long on a straight shaft some
21/2 ft long).  This was used
adze fashion and it was possible
to cut one's feet.  Turves were
dried for several months.
  He told a complex story
of how a local man was
murdered by robbers and his
brother was suspected because
he was in bed with an injury
supposed to have been received
while committing the murder.
He explained that he had 
cut his foot while cutting turf
on the moor, but he was
nevertheless convicted of the 
murder and "'e was 'ung in
Leicester Square" [our informant
did not explain why].
  He knew of the bandits

who lived in Predannack
windmill, and related a gun
fight which took place while
they were concealed behind "a
griglin [Corn. "heather"] 'edge"
[i.e. a turf wall].
  It was not clear how
the bandits made a living, but
he told of a messanger trav-
elling on horseback with money
from Lizard-town to Helston.
While he was passing the entrance
to Bochym, a man sprang out
from behind a hedge snd cut 
the girth of his saddle, but he
nonetheless escaped.
  The chronology of these tales
was not clear, but this last
seems to have taken place
not much before 1900.

  A man in Constantine was
plowing a field when he came
across a huge stone which
read "Turn me up & find
some more".  Expecting treasure,
when he had an opportunity 
he fetched a lot of men and
horses and turned the stone
over.  On the other side it said
"Put me back where 'A was
before".

April 12.
  The Trelowarren plantations
(near the B3293) have been very
extensively felled recently.  Altho'
they contain a proportion of
oak and beech they are almost
certainly all secondary.
  At Chybilly, a large farm,
an outbuilding some 25 ft
square stands on rows of granite
staddle stones ([SYMBOL] 28}.  It is
timber-framed and hung with
slates.

     Halliggye.
  A hamlet of 3 cottages,
rather isolated in large fields
([SYMBOL] 2), and the field walls around
of no obvioous interest.  The
hamlet is, however, surrounded
3005
by a very substantial wall,
terraced on the N.W. where the
fogou is. Excellent view-point.
  Two of the cottages are 
perhaps one L-shaped house
([SYMOL] 4), with stone walls, thatched
roof (recently renewed), and a 
massive cob chimney.
  The garden to the N. of
the house, above and around
the fogou, has a complex
series of terraces and 
changes of level.
  The fogou was visited with
Lady Vyvyan and her children.
The family had been there
for some 7 centuries, and
she is very interested in the
fogou. but produced no new
facts about it. It contained

[13006-13007]
3006
a party of about 30 with
ease which is the largest num-
ber she had known.  We were
told there was some fear for
its stsbility, but could find no
defect save a cracked lintel,
which probably ought to be
shored up.  She was relieved
when we mentioned the possibility
of a grant from the Ministry
of Works.
  About a dozen horseshoe bats
in the fogou.  No Schistostega.
  Lady Vyvyan says she knows
of no more of the fogou, though
the original entrance is not
known and there are two
arms blocked with rubble.  A large
cavity was once found on 
another part of the site.

Trelowarren Mill Wood.

Quercus robur & petraea
about equally frequent.
Co-dom. Trunks c. 40 ft
high, with a further 30 ft
of crooked branches.  Dia
c. 2ft.  Apparently even-aged
and not regenerating.

Ash uneven-aged.  Larger 
are similar in size to the
oaks and similar in habit.

Hazel scattered under-storey.
No regular coppicing.

Beech uneven-aged.
Big trees c. 80 ft x 3 ft. Many

[13010-13011]
pole-sized.
  Holly occ small

Abies occ big trees  Re-
generating.

Big fallen beech with
much Ganoderma.


Wood above the mill leat
has some very large [????]
oaks.  Younger beech and ash.

Sycamore - freq. small trees,
not joining the canopy.
Wall at the bottom on
the Hallggye side of the [????]
        coursed stones set
        on edge.
3011
Wood above mill leat is
carpeted with ivy.

Main Wood (below mill leat).
Steep ground, but with
deep soil and few exposed
rocks.  Numerous springs in
places and some very wet
quagmiry flushes with abun-
dant Oenanthe crocata and
Chrysosplenium.
  Mainly a 1-layered
wood:  understorey very sparse.
Large trees oak, beech
and Abies, of remarkable
height and diameter.
 Very abundant epiphytes
and bryophytes.  Hookereia very
abundant along stream.

[13012-13013]

3013
A.  Corkscrew-like oaks, with
beech among them, leaning
over the tidal mud and their
lower branches immersed at
high water.  Abundant epiphytes.
B  Mainly beech of fairly
recent origin, some oak.
C. Active farm.
D. Ruined mill, with some
blocked windows probably 17th
cent.
E. Gearhills Wood, mainly young
conifer plantations, but some
large and well-grown oaks.
F. Main Trelowarren Mill Wood.
Note stream-side wall at
bottom.  Bounded above by
dried-up mill leat.
G Upper, possibly secondary wood.
 
[13014-13015]
3014
Much fallen timber.
  The introduced sand-
hopper (see Lizard Field Club)
is a woodlouse-shaped
creature about 6 mm long,
found under stones and logs
in great abundance.
 Ground cover of higher
plants sparse at present.
Includes mercury.
  The numerous woodland
plants and woodland bryo-
phytes with the nature of the
site, suggest that this is a
primary wood.  Probably it
was originally an oak wood,
but the present large trees
must result almost entirely 
from woodland management
3015
perhaps of c. 1800.  Hardly a
trace remains of any earlier
woodland structure.  The oaks
are now in decline;  the beeches
and ashes, and even Abies
form uneven-aged populations.
Sycamore is a relatively recent
invader.

Upper wood (above the leat).
  Equally steep, much drier.
  Very different age-struc-
ture.  Large oaks ([SYMBOL] 7) more
clearly ex-dominant, shorter
but more massive, and
clearly pioneer in habit
with very wide crowns;  now
often overtopped by beech
and ash and over-mature.

[13016-13017]
3016
  Hardly any understorey.
  Abundant ivy on the 
ground, but little other vege-
tation discernible.  Bryophytes
much less abundant.
  At the top, the wood
abuts on a field, and has
slightly encroached over the
boundary wall.
  Apparently old secondary
woodland. The oldest oaks
are clearly a pioneer genera-
tion, and probably older than
the reorganization of the
main wood.  The boundary be-
tween the two structures is the
old leat, on whose outer wall
several very large oaks grow.
3017
  Manaccan Fig-tree.
  At Manaccan is a 
small Norman church built
of the local schist.
  The fig tree grows out 
of the S.W. quoin of the
nave, its lowest visible point
being some 4 ft above the
ground.  It has two trunks,
the larger c. 1 ft diam., about
20 ft high despite recent
pruning.  These arise from
a massive tuberous base
in a shield shape some 3 ft
across closely applied to the
masonry.  The base has nu-
merous epicormics and is
pruned from time to time.
The top is attached by wire 

[13018-13019]

stays to the
tower.  The          [DIAG]
wall is some 
2 ft thick
and well
pointed.  There
is no evidence
of where the roots
go.  The
wall is
perfectly sound
and regular
inside.  The
tree is said
to have been 
there for
centuries. [SYMBOL] 9,10.
3019
  Most of the woods along
the Creek are secondary and
full of exotics.  Opposite St Anthony
is an oak wood on a very
steep slope, but its trees are
younger and less corkscrew
than thoae of the more inland
woods.  Much Rhododendron.
  Helford is on a tidal 
creek with a vehicle ford.

April 8. [cont. p. 2966]
On the seaward side, the old
fields run considerably further
than the present grassland,
and their walls are distinct
under the bracken which covers
a broad band of the cliff head.
[SYMBOL] 17.
  The vegetation of mega-
lithic walls is not obviously
outstanding.  Frequently there
are no woody plants at all
or only Ulex europaens.
  At Zennor there was a 
strong shower of snow, falling
heavily for a few minutes but
not settling.

      Uny Lelant.
A large circular church-
3021
yard with a surrounding bank.

Below
Uny Lelant
church
is a            [DIAG]
range of
rather un-
stable
metamor-
phic cliffs with sand blown
on top of them, forming old
dunes N.W. of the church, like
Hayle Towans over the estuary.
  In these cliffs is a quan-
tity of Adiantum, growing
in abundance in two or
three flushes near the point.
A dense rather matted turf-like
stand.  Very brown but with
signs of life.  An unexpected

site, very exposed to the N.E. and
continually drifted over by sand
falling from the dunes above.
  A strong tidal current in
the harbour.
  Between Gwinear and Gwi-
thian is one of the exceptionsl
non-lizard occurrences of Erica
vagans.  About 6 large bushes
on an otherwise unremarkable
roadside hedge-top.  The hedge
in question perhaps represents
the enclosure of a bit of 
heathland on a roadside verge
because another hedge runs 
parallel to it immediately
to the S.
At Crowan Beacon, in
Crowan, is a small fragment
of heathland on Cammenellis
3023
granite, complete with a small
Tor like those in the Land's End
peninsula.

  Frost has been reported on
the Lizard plateau on several
occasions in the last few
days.
  Vegetation is very backward
in general.
  No evidence of further en-
croachment by the sea at
Coverack.
