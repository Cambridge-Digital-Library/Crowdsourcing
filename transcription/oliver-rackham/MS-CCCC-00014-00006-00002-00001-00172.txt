Wood at Carn Kennack
The N. side of the Gwendreath
valley is covered with an exten-
sive elm wood (rough grass on
the O.S.)
The closes round Carn Ken-
nack hoouse (still inhabited) are
overgrown with Ulmus glabra or
[12944-12945]

hollandica. The slopes to the
N.W. are covered with U.stricta.
The flat valley floor is very
swampy, with sallow carr and
Carex paniculata, Iris [SYMBOL] [????]nanthe
crocata. Primroses abundant.
The closes round the house
are bounded by ruined stone
hedges and a derelict fence.

These bench ends are re-

may be deliberately designed to
use such.

Trebaweth

Lane at
796198

[DIAG]

13" Stump on one of the walls

Sallow 97 girth
Wall to W. of track of huge
boulders in 2 courses
  The wall from 793205
to 795201 may be the boundary

[12950-12951]
2950
between Trebaweth and Treevean
(not necessarily).  Type decribed on
p. 2948 wioth other kinds of wall
abutting on it.
  Trebaweth is a large farm
with massive stone buildings of
indeterminate age.
  From Trebaweth to the sea
is a curious lane probably of
great antiquity between walls
of various types, some of them
megalithic.  In its northern part
it is double (as on previous page).
Ashes and elms of various
sizes grow on the walls.
By one of the walls is a 
huge sallow (previous page).
E. of this lane is a small
area of [!!!!ash] wood, mainly sallow 
2951
and Prunus;  part of a complex series
of wood, scrub, and heath, extending
to the sea around the S. end of
the track.  Small areas of improved
grassland on the 25 ft raised beach.
  Between the lane and the 
Grove is a similar mixture of
heathland types to that further W.
  At 792192 is a ruined building
or tiny very massive enclosure
right on the cliff and partly
fallen in the sea.
  Fires have been very serious,
especially immediately E. of
The Grove and a large tract to
the W. The Grove itself is ap-
parently undamaged.
  N. of St Keverne is a valley
full of sallow woods looking

[12952-12953]
2952
from a distance very like Main
Dale.

[Kennack, cont. from p. 2944.]
These form roughly the boundary
of the two ewlms.  The presence
of Ruscus is curious.
On the way to Trevenwith
is an arable field with Antho-
ccros and other notable bryophytes.

Day's activities.
Morning:  Three brothers; pH pool;
Kennack (equinoctial low tide).
Afternoon:  Mullion; walk North
Corner-Guilley-point 292 in Main

Coverack.

April 8.
  There was a quite severe frost
during the night.
Degibna Wood, Kelston, is
mainly oak.
  In Sithney there are several
small woods of Ulmus hollandica
developing around small wet
enclosures with megalithic walls.
  St Michael's Mount is a
granite outcrop with characteristic
weathered cliffs and piled boul-
ders on the seaward side.
  Cynodon was found at
Marazion by the railway station.
In its [!!!!winter] state it is bleached
abd shows little sign of life.
The rhizome much resembles 
Agropyron junceiforme, differing

[12954-12955]
2954
in its smaller size, hairiness,
and lack of red pigment.  Leaf
bases in untidy tufts at intervals
marking the short shoots.  It
grows in the most seaward part
of the dunes where this is compacted
by treading and wave action.
  The fen at Marazion con-
sists mainly of Phragmites.  No
swallows seen.
Sibthorpia at Canopus was
hard to find, but flourishes in
two patches about 20 yrds
upstream from the road.  On the
earthen sides of a wall,
facing N.E.
in light shade
of sallow.[DIAG]

a pool of extreme low water.
In small groups.  Much re-
sembles Delesseria, but it is
very thin, of filmy consistency,
and flexible though fairly tough.
Deep cherry-red colour.  Under
a hand-lens it is seen to be
one cell thick, composed of
chains of cells in a bipinnate
arrangement.  It looks paren-
chymatous.  Cells just visible
with the naked eye.  Not in
shade.
In shallow rainwater pools
in the spray zone at Hella
Point.  Numerous small black
hemispheres, c. 5 mm dia., of
gelatinous-corky consistency.
