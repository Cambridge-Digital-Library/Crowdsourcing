valley is covered with an exten-

the O.S.)
The closes round Carn Ken-

overgrown with Ulmus glabra or

The flat valley floor is very
swampy, with sallow carr and
Carex paniculata, Iris [SYMBOL] [????]nanthe

13" Stump on one of the walls

Sallow 97 girth
Wall to W. of track of huge
boulders in 2 courses
  The wall from 793205
to 795201 may be the boundary

2950
between Trebaweth and Treevean
(not necessarily).  Type decribed on
p. 2948 wioth other kinds of wall
abutting on it.
  Trebaweth is a large farm
with massive stone buildings of
indeterminate age.
  From Trebaweth to the sea
is a curious lane probably of
great antiquity between walls
of various types, some of them
megalithic.  In its northern part
it is double (as on previous page).
Ashes and elms of various
sizes grow on the walls.
By one of the walls is a 
huge sallow (previous page).
E. of this lane is a small
area of [!!!!ash] wood, mainly sallow 
2951
and Prunus;  part of a complex series
of wood, scrub, and heath, extending
to the sea around the S. end of
the track.  Small areas of improved
grassland on the 25 ft raised beach.
  Between the lane and the 
Grove is a similar mixture of
heathland types to that further W.
  At 792192 is a ruined building
or tiny very massive enclosure
right on the cliff and partly
fallen in the sea.
  Fires have been very serious,
especially immediately E. of
The Grove and a large tract to
the W. The Grove itself is ap-
parently undamaged.
  N. of St Keverne is a valley
full of sallow woods looking

[12952-12953]
2952
from a distance very like Main
Dale.

[Kennack, cont. from p. 2944.]
These form roughly the boundary
of the two ewlms.  The presence
of Ruscus is curious.
On the way to Trevenwith
is an arable field with Antho-
ccros and other notable bryophytes.

Day's activities.

April 8.
  There was a quite severe frost
during the night.
Degibna Wood, Kelston, is
mainly oak.
  In Sithney there are several
small woods of Ulmus hollandica
developing around small wet
enclosures with megalithic walls.
  St Michael's Mount is a
granite outcrop with characteristic
weathered cliffs and piled boul-
ders on the seaward side.
  Cynodon was found at
Marazion by the railway station.
In its [!!!!winter] state it is bleached
abd shows little sign of life.
The rhizome much resembles 
Agropyron junceiforme, differing

[12954-12955]
2954
in its smaller size, hairiness,
and lack of red pigment.  Leaf
bases in untidy tufts at intervals
marking the short shoots.  It
grows in the most seaward part
of the dunes where this is compacted
by treading and wave action.
  The fen at Marazion con-
sists mainly of Phragmites.  No
swallows seen.
Sibthorpia at Canopus was
hard to find, but flourishes in
two patches about 20 yrds
upstream from the road.  On the
earthen sides of a wall,
facing N.E.
in light shade
of sallow.[DIAG]

Porthgwarra.

          Granite rocks
          on the cliff
          edge by Pol-
   ostock Zawn, weathered 
into mushroom shapes.

Hypoglossum was found in

[DIAG]


[12956-12957]
2956
a pool of extreme low water.
In small groups.  Much re-
sembles Delesseria, but it is
very thin, of filmy consistency,
and flexible though fairly tough.
Deep cherry-red colour.  Under
a hand-lens it is seen to be
one cell thick, composed of
chains of cells in a bipinnate
arrangement.  It looks paren-
chymatous.  Cells just visible
with the naked eye.  Not in
shade.
  In shallow rainwater pools
in the spray zone at Hella
Point.  Numerous small black
hemispheres, c. 5 mm dia., of
gelatinous-corky consistency.
2957
Under the microscope they consist
of Scytonema-like filaments
with heterocysts.
  The granite around Polostock
Zawn is strongly cuboidally
jointed, mainly in vertical planes.
It weathers into deep chimneys
and tall pinnacles,[SYMBOL] 5,8  some of
the latter mushroom-shaped.
The chimneys are filled with
softer deposits which are
more or less eroded out.  Some
of this material is in situ
but most is evidently head
deposited in grykes  
in an earlier phase.
The granite contains large
and elegant phenocrysts.  A few
doloritic dykes.  Frequent xeno-
[12958-12959]
2958
liths of metamorphic rock.
these are sharply defined
boulders commonly 1 ft dia.
with rounded corners  of a 
finer texture and darker
colour than the granite.  The
xenoliths weather at the
same rste as the granite.
They often contain large
phenocrysts identical with those
in the granite and evidently
formed inside the inclusion.
  The phenocrysts often have
an oriented direction indicating
flow lijnes in rhe mplten grsnite
(not usually relaterd to the wea-
thering plnes).  In one case
alarge xenolith sectioned in
a cliff was seen to have
2959
flow lines going round it as
well as phenocrysts inside [SYMBOL] 10
  The Chair Ladder 
is a spectacular
pinnacle of cuboidal   [DIAG]
blocks about 15 ft
square more or less
weathered out and
forming a stack
on top of one another.
  Fine quartz           [SYMBOL] 13
crystals, up to c. 1/4 in. side,
occur in lenticular masses in
the granite. [SYMBOL] 4
  Tol-pedn-penwith is a
collapsed cavern formed inside
a very thick quartzite vein
which is nesrly verticsl.  It
has two entrances at sea.

[12960-12961]

level, one along the vein,
the other at right angles to
it.  [SYMBOL] 12.
  Around Tol Pedn Penwith
there is a colony of kitti-
wakes which appear to nest
in the ogo.  They flew around
inside the Mole uttering loud
mournful mewing cries which
gave a most sinister impression.
  Scilla verna is flowering
on the S. facing slopes near
Tol Pedn Penwith, but all the
open flowers appear to be
smutted.
  On the S.W. facing slope of 
a small hanging valley be-
tween Carn Guthensbras and
Porth Loe is a fairy ring
2961
some 100 ft dia. in dense
Festucs rubra turf.  See p. 2963.
  The stacks of the Gwennap
peninsula do not have any
beets or mallows, doubtless be-
cause of lack of soil.
  A seal was seen swim-
ming around and apparently
playing in Porth Loe.
  At the head of Porth Loe is
a small Phragmites-Sphagnum 
fen.
  The building on the S.
side of the road at Porth-
gwarra, shown on the O.S. at
3681/22181/2, is a small shed
or hut long roofless, built of
great granite blocks with
several orthostats at the door

[12962-12963]
2962
jambs and forming the lower
part of the walls [SYMBOL] 16.

  The road from Polgigga
to Porthgwarra is bounded 
by walls of various types but
especially the "tombstone" type
of orthostats alone.  Several 
megalithic buildings including
a megalithic privy in front of 
th house 370223.

  The succession on the Porth-
gwarra boulder (p. 07837, 136)
appears now to have much
less Teloschistes than in 1956.
Sedum acre appears to be
a successor to Sphaenophorus.
[SYMBOL] 11.
2963
  On a slope N.W. of Tol-
pedn-penwith is an annular
patch of dark green Festuca
rubra about 30 yards across, 
with a sharp edge and less
vigorous growth inside.  Either a
fairy ring or an unusually
vigorous clone.  Probably on deep
head. [SYMBOL] 14.
  In the cliffs round the head
of Porth Loe are curious "wood-
louse" formations
of double vertical  [DIAG]
rows of granite
blocks being
weathered out
of the face.  In
these cliffs are blocks in all
stsges of detschment, and the

[12964-12965]
2964
beach is composed of water-roun-
ded pebbles mostly between
3 and 6 ft diam. [SYMBOL] 15.

  Carn Galver has been badly
burnt again.

       Zennor.
  A few megalithic walls built 
into houses in the church-town.
  A brief visit twas made to
Zennor Head.  This is one 
of a series of headlands of
sedimentary and metamorphic 
rocks (greenstone).  They form
rugged and irregular cliffs,
without the weathering regu-
larity of the granite, and
are connected by necks to the
2965
granite of the main land-mass.
Pendour cove W. of Zennor
Head is entirely surrounded by 
such cliffs, here precipitous and
slabby and quite inaccessible.
  The road from Zennor
to Zennor Head runs between
stone hedges c. 6 ft high, usu-
ally of a single row of huge
boulders presenting a flattened
face to the road, with levelling
up blocks and sometimes a few
cubical courses on top. [SYMBOL] 20,21.
The course of these walls
is zigzag and irregular and
there are several triangular
areas between the wall and 
the road.
  Field walls on the N.E.
