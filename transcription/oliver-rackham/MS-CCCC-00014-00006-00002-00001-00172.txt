2950
between Trebaweth and Treevean
(not necessarily).  Type decribed on
p. 2948 wioth other kinds of wall
abutting on it.
  Trebaweth is a large farm
with massive stone buildings of
indeterminate age.
  From Trebaweth to the sea
is a curious lane probably of
great antiquity between walls
of various types, some of them
megalithic.  In its northern part
it is double (as on previous page).
Ashes and elms of various
sizes grow on the walls.
By one of the walls is a 
huge sallow (previous page).
E. of this lane is a small
area of [!!!!ash] wood, mainly sallow 
2951
and Prunus;  part of a complex series
of wood, scrub, and heath, extending
to the sea around the S. end of
the track.  Small areas of improved
grassland on the 25 ft raised beach.
  Between the lane and the 
Grove is a similar mixture of
heathland types to that further W.
  At 792192 is a ruined building
or tiny very massive enclosure
right on the cliff and partly
fallen in the sea.
  Fires have been very serious,
especially immediately E. of
The Grove and a large tract to
the W. The Grove itself is ap-
parently undamaged.
  N. of St Keverne is a valley
full of sallow woods looking

[12952-12953]
2952
from a distance very like Main
Dale.

[Kennack, cont. from p. 2944.]
These form roughly the boundary
of the two ewlms.  The presence
of Ruscus is curious.
On the way to Trevenwith
is an arable field with Antho-
ccros and other notable bryophytes.

April 8.
  There was a quite severe frost
during the night.
Degibna Wood, Kelston, is
mainly oak.
  In Sithney there are several
small woods of Ulmus hollandica
developing around small wet
enclosures with megalithic walls.
  St Michael's Mount is a
granite outcrop with characteristic
weathered cliffs and piled boul-
ders on the seaward side.
  Cynodon was found at
Marazion by the railway station.
In its [!!!!winter] state it is bleached
abd shows little sign of life.
The rhizome much resembles 
Agropyron junceiforme, differing

[12954-12955]
2954
in its smaller size, hairiness,
and lack of red pigment.  Leaf
bases in untidy tufts at intervals
marking the short shoots.  It
grows in the most seaward part
of the dunes where this is compacted
by treading and wave action.
  The fen at Marazion con-
sists mainly of Phragmites.  No
swallows seen.
Sibthorpia at Canopus was
hard to find, but flourishes in
two patches about 20 yrds
upstream from the road.  On the
earthen sides of a wall,
facing N.E.
in light shade
of sallow.[DIAG]

Hypoglossum was found in

[DIAG]


[12956-12957]
2956
a pool of extreme low water.
In small groups.  Much re-
sembles Delesseria, but it is
very thin, of filmy consistency,
and flexible though fairly tough.
Deep cherry-red colour.  Under
a hand-lens it is seen to be
one cell thick, composed of
chains of cells in a bipinnate
arrangement.  It looks paren-
chymatous.  Cells just visible
with the naked eye.  Not in
shade.
  In shallow rainwater pools
in the spray zone at Hella
Point.  Numerous small black
hemispheres, c. 5 mm dia., of
gelatinous-corky consistency.
2957
Under the microscope they consist
of Scytonema-like filaments
with heterocysts.
  The granite around Polostock
Zawn is strongly cuboidally
jointed, mainly in vertical planes.
It weathers into deep chimneys
and tall pinnacles,[SYMBOL] 5,8  some of
the latter mushroom-shaped.
The chimneys are filled with
softer deposits which are
more or less eroded out.  Some
of this material is in situ
but most is evidently head
deposited in grykes  
in an earlier phase.
The granite contains large
and elegant phenocrysts.  A few
doloritic dykes.  Frequent xeno-

liths of metamorphic rock.
these are sharply defined
boulders commonly 1 ft dia.
with rounded corners  of a 
finer texture and darker
colour than the granite.  The
xenoliths weather at the
same rste as the granite.
They often contain large
phenocrysts identical with those
in the granite and evidently
formed inside the inclusion.
  The phenocrysts often have
an oriented direction indicating
flow lijnes in rhe mplten grsnite
(not usually relaterd to the wea-
thering plnes).  In one case
alarge xenolith sectioned in
a cliff was seen to have
2959
flow lines going round it as
well as phenocrysts inside [SYMBOL] 10
  The Chair Ladder 
is a spectacular
pinnacle of cuboidal   [DIAG]
blocks about 15 ft
square more or less
weathered out and
forming a stack
on top of one another.
  Fine quartz           [SYMBOL] 13

occur in lenticular masses in

  Tol-pedn-penwith is a
collapsed cavern formed inside
a very thick quartzite vein
which is nesrly verticsl.  It
has two entrances at sea.

level, one along the vein,
the other at right angles to
it.  [SYMBOL] 12.
  Around Tol Pedn Penwith
there is a colony of kitti-
wakes which appear to nest
in the ogo.  They flew around
inside the Mole uttering loud
mournful mewing cries which
gave a most sinister impression.
  Scilla verna is flowering
on the S. facing slopes near
Tol Pedn Penwith, but all the
open flowers appear to be
smutted.
  On the S.W. facing slope of 
a small hanging valley be-
tween Carn Guthensbras and
Porth Loe is a fairy ring
2961
some 100 ft dia. in dense
Festucs rubra turf.  See p. 2963.
  The stacks of the Gwennap
peninsula do not have any
beets or mallows, doubtless be-
cause of lack of soil.
  A seal was seen swim-
ming around and apparently
playing in Porth Loe.
  At the head of Porth Loe is
a small Phragmites-Sphagnum 
fen.
  The building on the S.
side of the road at Porth-
gwarra, shown on the O.S. at
3681/22181/2, is a small shed
or hut long roofless, built of
great granite blocks with
several orthostats at the door

[12962-12963]
2962
jambs and forming the lower
part of the walls [SYMBOL] 16.

  The road from Polgigga
to Porthgwarra is bounded 
by walls of various types but
especially the "tombstone" type
of orthostats alone.  Several 
megalithic buildings including
a megalithic privy in front of 
th house 370223.

  The succession on the Porth-
gwarra boulder (p. 07837, 136)
appears now to have much
less Teloschistes than in 1956.
Sedum acre appears to be
a successor to Sphaenophorus.
[SYMBOL] 11.
2963
  On a slope N.W. of Tol-
pedn-penwith is an annular
patch of dark green Festuca
rubra about 30 yards across, 
with a sharp edge and less
vigorous growth inside.  Either a
fairy ring or an unusually
vigorous clone.  Probably on deep
head. [SYMBOL] 14.
  In the cliffs round the head
of Porth Loe are curious "wood-
louse" formations
of double vertical  [DIAG]
rows of granite
blocks being
weathered out
of the face.  In
these cliffs are blocks in all
stsges of detschment, and the

[12964-12965]
2964
beach is composed of water-roun-
ded pebbles mostly between
3 and 6 ft diam. [SYMBOL] 15.

  Carn Galver has been badly
burnt again.

       Zennor.
  A few megalithic walls built 
into houses in the church-town.
  A brief visit twas made to
Zennor Head.  This is one 
of a series of headlands of
sedimentary and metamorphic 
rocks (greenstone).  They form
rugged and irregular cliffs,
without the weathering regu-
larity of the granite, and
are connected by necks to the
2965
granite of the main land-mass.
Pendour cove W. of Zennor
Head is entirely surrounded by 
such cliffs, here precipitous and
slabby and quite inaccessible.
  The road from Zennor
to Zennor Head runs between
stone hedges c. 6 ft high, usu-
ally of a single row of huge
boulders presenting a flattened
face to the road, with levelling
up blocks and sometimes a few
cubical courses on top. [SYMBOL] 20,21.
The course of these walls
is zigzag and irregular and
there are several triangular
areas between the wall and 
the road.
  Field walls on the N.E.

[12966-12967]
2966
side of the Pendower valley
are variable but often of the
same type: [SYMBOL] 22.
  The N.E. wall alongside
the road is mainly of the
megalithic type just described;
the S.W. wall contains stretches
of other types and is perhaps
later.
  The S.W. side of Pendower
valley, clearly visible from the
road, has a system of small
irregularly square fields, often
overgrown and not visible.  A few
very tiny fields (sheep-folds?) are
overgrown with scrub.  This field
system runs to the cliff edge
and the bottom of the valley.

[DIAG]

[12970-12971]
2970
the subdivision walls abut-
ting against it.
  A prominent earth track
runs across the area, disused
at least since Predannack
airfield was made.  The
ground is deeply scored by par-
allel ruts.  They run across
both tall and short heath.
On short they do not make
much difference to the species
present, but Molinia assumes
dominance.  They are often
associated with Erica vagans
in tall.
  There are two pools in
the boundary stream.  One
by the W. compoartment is
made by damming for cattle
2971
in the field to the N.E. to
drink from.  Another is just
below the ford at the S.E.
There is documentary evidence
for a mill pool somewhere
here.  This pool is almost
silted up and full of aquatic
vegetation.
  The site, especially the
N. compartment, is sporadically
grazed by trespassing cattle.
It is remarkably free from
recent burning.

  The site is approached
by a series of little used cart
tracks (now very wet). The main
cart track is a bridle road
(a suggestion that bicycles
[12972-12973]
2972
might lawfully be ridden over
the ford resulted in some
mirth).
  The croft Grochall is an
inhabited farm and all its
fields save the westernmost
are improved grass, though 
with very large tree-grown
hedges especially round the
perimeter.

  The large pool in North Com-
partment is about 2 ft deep.
Edges quite well defined. No 
corresponding mound or bank.

  Regular tall and short
heath.  Serpentine belt of tall heath
meandering from the larger
pool to the stream.
  Course of the eastern
stream marked by a complex
series of semi-aquatic com-
munities, including some with
Typha and [!!!!many] several woody.
  No trace of ploughing.
  This area is very long
unburnt, wirh poorly developed
erosion hollows in the short
heath.  A possible site for
Lycopodium selago though
none could bw found.

West Compartment.
  Tall and short heath

[12974-12975]
2974
intermixed in complex streaks
with a N.E.-S.W. tendency.
Various intermediate commu-
nities.  Ploughing ridges visible
in places, suggesting that the
streaks are modified by plough-
ing from normal short heath.

Middle Compartment.
  Streaks more pronounced
than in West.

East Compartment.
  Walled off from the stream,
as far as can be told (unlike
North & South).  Large gap in the
boundary at the S. end ap-
pears to be real.
  The internsl bank is ap-
parently earthern.
2975
Contains a barrow and
several small tor-like out-
crops.
  Thickets of Ulex europaens
along the stream.  Other
woody communities (Salix and
Prunus scrub) in the stream
bed.
  Neither sub-compartment
shows any sign of ploughing.

South Compartment.
  Consists of a well-defined
plateau and a S. facing
slope, rocky in parts nd
with two small quarries at
the base.  Flushes arise at
the top of this slope.  Below
the slope is astrip of flat
land by the  stream.

[12976-12977]
2976
  The stone row in the E.
is not connected to any other
earthwork.  The boundary stones
in it are almost certsinly 
later.
  Short and tall heath on
the plateau.  Juncus mariti-
mus, scattered elsewhere on
the site, is abundant in
parts of the edge of the pla-
teasu.  The rock slope con-
tains areas of mixed heath
and also broad flushes with
almost pure Schoenus (evi-
dently a variant of tall heath).
Rock heath is found only
in a few square yards in the
S. corner.
  Semi-aquatic communities
complex but mappable.
