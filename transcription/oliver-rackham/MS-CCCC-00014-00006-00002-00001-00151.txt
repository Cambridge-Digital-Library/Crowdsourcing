October 1.
The Caryopteris is flowering
in the Sarcophagus.
The Ipomoeae are flowering
well but have not made much
growth.
The gourds are growing 
vigorously and have produced
a few small fruit.
The Caryopteris is well
established and in flower.
Tropaeolum canariensis
(several plants in one tub)
has grown c.5ft high and is
now flowering.
Cobaea scandeus has grown
about 6ft high (from a bought
plant) and flowered freely.

Hayley Wood (W.H.Palmer).
Juncus effusus [!!!!]appears to[!!!!] and con-
glomeratus appear to be totally
absent from the area to be 
cut this winter.
A deer was seen in the
middle of the [????] N.W ride,
and in the middle of the N.E.
ride. Apparently an isolated
animal in each case.
Ptilidium pulcherrimum
flourishes in both its sites.

1. PLeurotus sapidus. Fallen ash.

2. Chlorociboria aeruginosa. A
sporophore on branch of ash,
boundary between the 1968 and
1969 coppice plots.

3. Coprinus micaceus.

4. Coprinus disseminatus.

[11396-11397]
5. On a rotten hazel branch
in the Triangle, patches c. 4 in.
long.
Effused. Subiculum white,
margin indefinite.
P.S. pale yellow, discol-
ouring buff, regular. PO. about
3 to the mm, smallish, angular,
thick-walled, slight daedali-
form tendency. P short.
C. none.
Closely adnate.

Physisporus mucidus?
[indeterminate]

[11398-11399]
6. Several on an ash
branch at the S. end of the
Triangle. Dorsolaterally at-
tached, 7/8 wide.
P. persistently dirty white.
tomentose, humid, nearly
flat, margin narrowly incur-
ved. 
L. thin, subcrowded, un-
equal, & narrow, radiating
from a central point, cream,
becoming snuff-brown slowly
when old.
C. thin, white, odourless,
no gelatinous layer.
Sp. honey-coloured sub
micr., broadly ellipsoidal (to
13/8 x as long, as wide),
smooth sub 1/6, often asym-
[DIAG]
metric.
Probably Crepidotus variabilis,
but C. inhonestus not ruled
out.

7. A few tufts in the main
ride opposite the coppice plots,
1 3/4 high. A tufted slender 
[11400-11401]
Clavaria branched at the 
top.
Trunk slender, irregular,
not flattened. Branches di-
chotomizing, obtuse, sinuses
obtuse, not flattened. Bright
egg yellow with reddish tinge
below and blackish base.
[DIAG]
Probably
Clavaria
corniculata.
[DIAG]
8. A few in a group on
the great elm log by the
Triangle entrance. 4 - 2- 3/8.
P. slightly convex, bright
golden yellow in the middle
and at edges, rather 
abruptly demarcated in col-
our from the rest which
is pale date-brown, mar-
gin incurved, not striate,
whole P. minutely and irre-
gularly wrinkled in all
directions. Skin of P. made
up sub micr. of large clear
round vesicular cells, cov-
ered with a remarkable thick
transparent tough gelatinous
layer which is full of small
spherical granules sub micr.
