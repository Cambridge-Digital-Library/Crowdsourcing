 October 1.
  The Caryopteris is flowering
in the Sarcophagus.
  The Ipomoeae are flowering
well but have not made much
growth.
  The gourds are growing 
vigorously and have produced
a few small fruit.
  The Caryopteris is well
established and in flower.
  Tropaeolum canariense
(several plants in one tub)
has grown c.5ft high and is
now flowering.
  Cobaea scandeus has grown
about 6ft high (from a bought
plant) and flowered freely.

Hayley Wood (W.H.Palmer).
Juncus effusus [!!!!] and con-
glomeratus appear to be totally
absent from the area to be 
cut this winter.
  A deer was seen in the
middle of the [????] N.W ride,
and in the middle of the N.E.
ride. Apparently an isolated
animal in each case.
  Ptilidium pulcherrimum
flourishes in both its sites.

1. PLeurotus sapidus. Fallen ash.

  Probably Crepidotus variabilis,
but C. inhonestus not ruled
out.

1400
Clavaria branched at the 
top.
  Trunk slender, irregular,
not flattened. Branches di-
chotomizing, obtuse, sinuses
obtuse, not flattened. Bright

8. A few in a group on
the great elm log by the
Triangle entrance. 4 - 2- 3/8.
  P. slightly convex, bright
golden yellow in the middle
and at edges, rather 
abruptly demarcated in col-
our from the rest which
is pale date-brown, mar-
gin incurved, not striate,
whole P. minutely and irre-
gularly wrinkled in all
directions. Skin of P. made
up sub micr. of large clear

transparent tough gelatinous
layer which is full of small
spherical granules sub micr.

equal, dirty lemon yellow at
base, whitish with pale brown
streaks above, not readily de-

freq. A. phalloides not seen.

Abundant on this and other Myce-
nas.
* Lactarius subdulcis.

[11406-11407]
1406

pine. 1 3/4 - 2 1/4 - 3//16.
P. nearly flat, foxy brown,
with small granular concolorous
scales in concentric rings,
matt, dry, margin plane, slightly
appendiculate.
  S. equal, concolorous,
paler above & below, stuffed,
semicartilaginous, matt, dry.
A. about 5/6 way up, ascending
and broken into scales, with
scales below, whitish. S. with
small granular acales above
1409
the A. and larger fibrous ones
below. Whole S. very like that
of Cystoderma amiantina in
ring & scales.
  L. thin, white, broad, adnexed,
unequal. Sp. white.
  C. thin, white, fleshy, almost
odourless.

[DIAG]   Certainly
        Cystoderma
        granulosum.
[11410-11411]
1410
13. Cystoderma amiantinum
  Rather abundant under
pines, often large. A common
form in grass is 1 1/4 - 3 3/16,
P.lemon yellow with ochre
middle markedly wrinkled
mainly radially, otherwise as
usual. Cf Moser p.144.

14. Once seen, a arge group
on a piece of rotting Peltigera
probably polydctylka. Largest
6 mm x 14 mm x 1/2 mm. Smaller
ones aa minute pins.
  P. slightly concave, dirty
white qith brown middle (prob-
ably hygrophanous and drying
inwards), margin striate,
otherwise smooth, dry, shiny
1411
in concentric zones. When

the tip.
  L. thin, white, crowded,
adnate, narrow, unequal.
  C. paper thin. Fungus
with slight unpleasant smell.
  No sign of a sclerotium.

Probably Microcollybia cirrata
Moser & Ramsb. disagree on
whether this should have a
sclerotium. It is supposed
to grow on rotting todestools.
[11412-11413]
1412

[DIAG]   Mycena has 
         also been
         considered.

among needles. Rather small.
P. entirely gray to brown (cf
Moser). Entire P. and most of S.

near top rusty brown.
L. thin, subdistant,unequal,
broad, sinuate, cinnamon brown,
   c. thin, aqueous, odourles.
   
   [DIAG]
   
H.J.H. says this is Inoloma
canina which it fits except in
1415
the hygrophany. If this
carries weight then it is
probably Hygrocybe paraganolis.
Much resembling H. armillata.

17. Hygrocybe armillata. Oc-
casional with the above and
in similar habitats elsewhere.

18. Lacrarius quietus, Abun-
dant in one place with oak &
birch. Bright orange-brown P.
Viscidity not detectable. Curious
faint smell of olive oil and
funguses, thus not L. glycios-
mus. Subacrid taste. Colours
too bright for L. subdulcis.
Distinction from L. ichoratus not 
certain, but S. does not darken
[11416-11417]
1416
as in that sp., remaining
concolorous with P.
  P. infundibuliform, with 
a small papilla, smooth, matt,

less abundant than last year.
1419
Small (1 1/2 - 1 1/2 - 1/4). P. buff,
S. not granulate, though mi-
nutely dotted (visible with
x 20) in upper half. Po
angualr, thin-walled, yellowish
olive (distinction from  S. gran-
ulatus). No blueing in C.

22. Boletus edulis. Rather 
frequent this year, always
single. Dr Hudson says it
would be more frequenr but
for the activities od certain
Poles living locally who collect
it to dry & sell in London.

  Abundant under pines.
3-2-1 (9ften larger).
  P. markedly concave, bril-

31. Polyporus perennis. Fairly abun-
dant.

1428
32. Kuhneromyces mutabilis. Re-
markably abundant this
year on pine and birch
stumps: much more frequent
than Tricholoma rutilans
and nearly as common as
Hypholoma fasciculare. It looks
remarkab;y like Armillaria
(not seen).

33. Tricholamopsis rutilans. Fairly
frequent on stumps, seldom

gether.

34. Naematoloma fasciculare. Abun-
