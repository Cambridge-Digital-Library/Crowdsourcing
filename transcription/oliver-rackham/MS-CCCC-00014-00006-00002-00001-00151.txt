 October 1.
  The Caryopteris is flowering
in the Sarcophagus.
  The Ipomoeae are flowering
well but have not made much
growth.
  The gourds are growing 
vigorously and have produced
a few small fruit.
  The Caryopteris is well
established and in flower.
  Tropaeolum canariense
(several plants in one tub)
has grown c.5ft high and is
now flowering.
  Cobaea scandeus has grown
about 6ft high (from a bought
plant) and flowered freely.

odourless.

[DIAG]   Certainly

13. Cystoderma amiantinum
  Rather abundant under
pines, often large. A common
form in grass is 1 1/4 - 3 3/16,
P.lemon yellow with ochre
middle markedly wrinkled
mainly radially, otherwise as
usual. Cf Moser p.144.

14. Once seen, a arge group
on a piece of rotting Peltigera
probably polydctylka. Largest
6 mm x 14 mm x 1/2 mm. Smaller
ones aa minute pins.
  P. slightly concave, dirty
white qith brown middle (prob-
ably hygrophanous and drying
inwards), margin striate,

  L. thin, white, crowded,
adnate, narrow, unequal.
  C. paper thin. Fungus
with slight unpleasant smell.
  No sign of a sclerotium.

whether this should have a
sclerotium. It is supposed
to grow on rotting todestools.

[DIAG]   Mycena has 
         also been
         considered.

broad, sinuate, cinnamon brown,
   c. thin, aqueous, odourles.
   
   [DIAG]
   
H.J.H. says this is Inoloma
canina which it fits except in
1415
the hygrophany. If this
carries weight then it is
probably Hygrocybe paraganolis.
Much resembling H. armillata.

17. Hygrocybe armillata. Oc-
casional with the above and
in similar habitats elsewhere.

18. Lacrarius quietus, Abun-
dant in one place with oak &
birch. Bright orange-brown P.
Viscidity not detectable. Curious
faint smell of olive oil and
funguses, thus not L. glycios-
mus. Subacrid taste. Colours
too bright for L. subdulcis.
Distinction from L. ichoratus not 
certain, but S. does not darken

angualr, thin-walled, yellowish
olive (distinction from  S. gran-
ulatus). No blueing in C.

22. Boletus edulis. Rather 
frequent this year, always
single. Dr Hudson says it

32. Kuhneromyces mutabilis. Re-
markably abundant this

  Around the shepherd's
cottage is a small cap of
river gravel, quite thin sND
with a lot of chslk marl
worked into it.
  A second well-defined gra-
vel cap exists in the angle
between rhe road and railway:
it is much larger, thicker, and
uncontaminated with chalk marl.
In a Dactylis ley, it is marked
as a conspicuously yellow area,
the surrunding dhalk marl
being covered with green grass;
the boundary is sharp.
The rest ischalk marl,
with some gravel and probably
gault worked into it.

  Tropeolum is still flowering
in my garden.
  Ipomoea slowly lost its
leaves and ceased flowering
and most of the plants are
now dead.
  The gourds continued to
grow and have produced
4 small fruit, which however
are rather soft snd show signs
of decaying from the calyx end.

A, B, C, D are located
exactly by measurement
from the wire fence. Distan-

  A and D are at the edge

of the ride, B and C on the
moat bank. It is intended to
coppice up to the bottom of
the moat between B and C.
  Posts between C & D are
approximnately placed by
doing an approximate traverse
on a guessed compass
bearing from C to D
and subsequentloy rectifying.

  Cornus is floweriung near
the W. gate.
  Primrose: open flowers
frequent throughout the
1968 coppice, occasional in the
marginal belt by 1969.
  Mercury: next year's stems
1 in high in places.

  Helleborus: a few of last
year's leaves still green,
most dead. Next year's shoot

  A crab-apple tree in the 
main N.W.-S.E. ride inside
the old wood appears to be
ssp. mitis.
  Note that the coppice 
area as marked cuts into
the 1961 marginal belt
between A and B. This
part of the belt is mainly
quite good hazel coppice
with big oaks. The new
belt is to be 30 yards
widw instead of about 50,
but this includes all the 
marginal scrub of Prunus,

Rubus and Rosa.
  The pond is exceptionally
full.
