Ptilidium pulcherrimum
in the coppice area is little
changed or slightly increased
in extent. Lepidozia reptans
flourishes.
The outlet at the S.W. corner
has been running recently.

January 25. [from p. 9876]
The large scar on the trunk
of the Fanshawe beech was
inspected and repaired.
[DIAG]
The sides were

9909

callused and the top less well
callused. The larger exposed
surface, A, was covered with
a thick layer of black mastic
on chicken-wire reinforcing.
This has now cracked in
several places and needs re-
placement, but was not
dealt with at present.
Below A is a sloping
ledge which results from the
breaking of the fallen branch.
The bark B below this was at first
left on but about a square
foot of bark below has
now died and could be
stripped off. Underneath were
various insect larvae, centi-
pedes, and other inverte-
brates. The wood surface

[9910-9911]
9910

shows much blue-stain but
little fungal attack. The bark
was cut back to the edge
of living bark (somewhat ir-
regular and ill-defined, with
no trace of any callus). The
exposed wood was adzed
smooth. The edge of the
ledge was bevelled with the
adze. The wood was slightly
rotten in pockets but where
the mastic covers it it
has been perfectly preserved.
All the exposed wood was
tarred with "Synthaproof".
There is a rot pocket
at the end of the ledge
(where a crack developed
when the branch split off).
This was partly raked out

9911

but could not be completed.

The strip of land on
the E. side of the wood be-
tween Hayley Lane and
the wood-bank contains
standards and small cop-
pice but not large. There
are several deep transverse
hollows which would make
it useless for a road at
present.
The wood has suddenly
become very wet. There is
much standing water in the
N. section. The pond contains
as much water as it will
hold.

At the Evanses', Coton, sev-
eral birds will come to the
window-ledge to eat grated
cheese: blue & Great-tits,
robins, &c. Three robins were
seen within a few yards of
each other at one time. A blue
tit normally drives away a
great tit, and a great tit a
robin.

A deer's skull was found
lying about within a few yards
of Box B to the S. It had

Much standing water in the N.

Larlingford Hollows
About 8 in the main group;
3 (damaged by cultivation
and lacking Carex) in front
of Overy Farm. Most of the
less disturbed ones have
large tussocks in the middle
which project out of the
water. Typical section probably.

The site is enclosed by
ridges to N. and W. but falls
away to the S.E. towards the
Kenninghall Beck.

Much of the rough grass

[9936-9937]

There is some large
coppice of alder in the Lark
valley about 1 mile W. of
Brandon.
The two small woods N.E.
of Wymondham, one on the Moot
Hill site, both appear to
be standards without coppice.
The Moot Hill wood is mainly
oak. The other is mainly
ash, with a considerable
proportion of poles.
A large Spiraea sucker was
bought from Norwich and planted
temporarily in the Sarcophagus.

Maples when cut exude
copiously. The exudation trick-
les out of the stump and is
quite deep brown. A nearly
colourless exudation pours much
faster out of the trunk, and
goes on for half an hour or
so. Both exudates are rather
sweet in taste but have no
prnounced flavour. No evil
followed their consumption.
Pussy-willow (S.caprea) is
