Ptilidium pulcherrimum
in the coppice area is little
changed or slightly increased
in extent. Lepidozia reptans
flourishes.
The outlet at the S.W. corner
has been running recently.

January 25. [from p. 9876]
The large scar on the trunk
of the Fanshawe beech was
inspected and repaired.
[DIAG]
The sides were

9909

callused and the top less well
callused. The larger exposed
surface, A, was covered with
a thick layer of black mastic
on chicken-wire reinforcing.
This has now cracked in
several places and needs re-
placement, but was not
dealt with at present.
Below A is a sloping
ledge which results from the
breaking of the fallen branch.
The bark B below this was at first
left on but about a square
foot of bark below has
now died and could be
stripped off. Underneath were
various insect larvae, centi-
pedes, and other inverte-
brates. The wood surface

[9910-9911]
9910

shows much blue-stain but
little fungal attack. The bark
was cut back to the edge
of living bark (somewhat ir-
regular and ill-defined, with
no trace of any callus). The
exposed wood was adzed
smooth. The edge of the
ledge was bevelled with the
adze. The wood was slightly
rotten in pockets but where
the mastic covers it it
has been perfectly preserved.
All the exposed wood was
tarred with "Synthaproof".
There is a rot pocket
at the end of the ledge
(where a crack developed
when the branch split off).
This was partly raked out

9911

but could not be completed.

The strip of land on
the E. side of the wood be-
tween Hayley Lane and
the wood-bank contains
standards and small cop-
pice but not large. There
are several deep transverse
hollows which would make
it useless for a road at
present.
The wood has suddenly
become very wet. There is
much standing water in the
N. section. The pond contains
as much water as it will
hold.

At the Evanses', Coton, sev-

window-ledge to eat grated
cheese: blue & Great-tits,
robins, &c. Three robins were
seen within a few yards of
each other at one time. A blue

About 8 in the main group;

Specimen of an ash stool
cut down in the Pond Ride
clearing. Preliminary analysis:
First ring represented c. 1795.
Evidence of coppicing at approx-
imately 1895, 1880, 1851, 1835,
1815. Ring widths excessively
narrow in coppicing periods,
sometimes declining before
coppicing as well as after. Widest
rings 1795-8, 1921-3, 1938. Section
occupies some [!!!!]5[!!!!]4 [SYMBOL] in. (exclud-
ing bark) from a stool diameter
17 in. Stool may thus be some

The remaining birch and
poplar trees in the fenced
part of the Meadow were
felled, except a few left for
shade.
A fire has consumed much
of the broom and scrub at
the end of the baulk.
The birch and poplar
was stacked after last year's
felling have been heavily

attacked by Stereum purpureum
and S. hirsutum, which are
fruiting together.
This poplar flowers later
than the one at Hayley.
A kestrel was seen hovering
for long periods in one place
near the Bourne railway bridge
on the B1046.
The birch and poplar
felled is a small grove on
the site of an earlier grove
which was also felled, as
shown by much-decayed stumps
and brushwood. Brambles are
vigorous under the trees.
Many birds roosted and there
were several elder bushes.
This wood was continuous
with the older birch and poplar

[9944-9945]
9944

on the Greensand Great Heath
adjoining.
The site of last year's felling
was densely overgrown with
poplar suckers and a few birch
coppice shoots. These were cut
back together with the brambles.

Violets (v. canina agg.) grow

Near the deer fence.
[DIAG]
An oak was felled onto
an ash stool. The tops form
a typical octopus on top of
the ash. One of the ash poles
was bent over and still has
the oak lying across it. The
top of this pole is long dead
but two of its laterals have
formed poles, one living, one
dead. This proves that
some oak felling took place

9953

after the last coppicing. The
living ash pole would provide a
date for the felling.

in single file. None with ant-
lers. Trotted fairly slowly and
could be certainly counted. Fawn

cream-white ones with irregular
pale brown patches. One
cream one brought up the rear.
The ancient ash stool
(p.9941) grew 11 paces from
the ditch, about 150yards
down the pond ride. It
was 36 in. high and had
some small poles. Many cop-
pice shoots had grown since
felling and the two very
narrow outermost rings certainly
correspond to these.

Typical section
[DIAG]
Foulden Common is an

9957

area of heathland.
S.W. of the road it
is grazed by cattle,
mainly grass with
bushes and sallows.
N.E. it is ungrazed,
with much Calluna
and Molinia. The
area around the
hollows is wooded
with birch and
a few pioneer
oaks. Mainly
Betula pendula.
None of the
trees appear
to be more
than 40 years
old at most.
The area is in a

[9958-9959]
9958
[DIAG]
slight hollow with a small
stream flowing from it.
The pits and hollows
contain Phragmites where
the water is not too deep,
and Cladium up to 6ft
high in shallower places.
Shaded pools have no
higher plants. Big Molinia

9959

tussocks in a few places.
Weeting Heath.
Devil's Ditch.
[DIAG]
Eroded by rabbits and by
the top being used as a
highway.
Rabbits now quite abundant
but not nearly as numerous as
formerly (almost the entire
surface of the ditch & surroun-
ding heath shows evidence of
diggings).
Gorse bushes few, old, not
evidently attacked.

[9960-9961]

Hypnum lacunosum
forms large patches on the
fosse slopes. Otherwise
very short Festuca ovina
turf.
The heathland itself is

mounds:
*Pottia bryoides (Duckett) [!!!!]8[!!!!] 14

Several rabbits were seen

in the late afternoon. Skulls
and bones are often turned
up.
There are many Scots
pines planted singly or in
small groups, c.100 years
old. They invariably have
a small thicket of elder
bushes underneath [SYMBOL]. This
persists for a time when the
pine has been felled, but
eventually dies. Young pines
c. 10 years old are now
fairly frequent, but middle-
-aged and very young trees
are missing.
All the plantations on the
N. part and W. side of the
Devil's Ditch are recent.
Cynoglossum is frequent

9963

on the heath part of the Ditch,
sometimes in quite large groups.
Red-Lodge Heath
The part S.E. of the
main road was visited, opposite

Wet hollows at Foulden.
Three types:
1. Simple hollows. Usually
shallow and sometimes only
damp. Bottom flattish. No
surrounding bank.
2. Extensive pools. Flat-bot-
tomed, perhaps up to 100
yards across. Large reed-
-fields, little open water.
They may come up to the ed-
ges of "pingoes"in which case
the water just outside the
bank may be deeper than
elsewhere and partly open.
3. "Pingoes", deep, with bank
and outer ditch.
The nature of the subsoil
was not discovered. Types
1 and 2 could be artificial,

9965

e.g. gravel pits or peat cut-
tings, but there are no mounds
as one would expect.
The "pingoes" (usually some-
what pear-shaped) have a
regular bank and can hardly
be artificial.

Elms in Old Waresley Wood

[9994-9995]

are confined to two areas.
U. carpinifolia. In the S.E. areas
they are dominant and closely
spaced: in the N.W. area they
are widely spaced and not
dominant.
Birch scarce in the S. and
W. parts of Waresley Wood.
The boundary between the
birch and non-birch areas is
quite sharp (p.9984) but not
apparently marked in any
way. It corresponds roughly to
a change of slope, and perhaps
to a change of soil (even though
not coinciding with the green-
sand on the Geological Survey).
Wood-closes. 12.

stools less frequent, and may
not occur far from the N.
ditch. Ground flora similar
but with more bluebells, ex-
cept in the shallow valley
in the middle of the S. side
where oxlips are abundant. No
obvious primroses.
The S.E. elm area extends
well into the wood-closes,
which also have elms in the
middle of the S. side. Ash
stools, however, do occur in the
banked area S.W. of the T-
-junction of rides.
