Ptilidium pulcherrimum
in the coppice area is little
changed or slightly increased
in extent. Lepidozia reptans
flourishes.
The outlet at the S.W. corner
has been running recently.

January 25. [from p. 9876]
The large scar on the trunk
of the Fanshawe beech was
inspected and repaired.
[DIAG]
The sides were

9909

callused and the top less well
callused. The larger exposed
surface, A, was covered with
a thick layer of black mastic
on chicken-wire reinforcing.
This has now cracked in
several places and needs re-
placement, but was not
dealt with at present.
Below A is a sloping
ledge which results from the
breaking of the fallen branch.
The bark B below this was at first
left on but about a square
foot of bark below has
now died and could be
stripped off. Underneath were
various insect larvae, centi-
pedes, and other inverte-
brates. The wood surface

[9910-9911]
9910

shows much blue-stain but
little fungal attack. The bark
was cut back to the edge
of living bark (somewhat ir-
regular and ill-defined, with
no trace of any callus). The
exposed wood was adzed
smooth. The edge of the
ledge was bevelled with the
adze. The wood was slightly
rotten in pockets but where
the mastic covers it it
has been perfectly preserved.
All the exposed wood was
tarred with "Synthaproof".
There is a rot pocket
at the end of the ledge
(where a crack developed
when the branch split off).
This was partly raked out

9911

but could not be completed.

The strip of land on
the E. side of the wood be-
tween Hayley Lane and
the wood-bank contains
standards and small cop-
pice but not large. There
are several deep transverse
hollows which would make
it useless for a road at
present.
The wood has suddenly
become very wet. There is
much standing water in the
N. section. The pond contains
as much water as it will
hold.

At the Evanses', Coton, sev-

window-ledge to eat grated
cheese: blue & Great-tits,
robins, &c. Three robins were
seen within a few yards of
each other at one time. A blue

About 8 in the main group;

Specimen of an ash stool
cut down in the Pond Ride
clearing. Preliminary analysis:
First ring represented c. 1795.
Evidence of coppicing at approx-
imately 1895, 1880, 1851, 1835,
1815. Ring widths excessively
narrow in coppicing periods,
sometimes declining before
coppicing as well as after. Widest
rings 1795-8, 1921-3, 1938. Section
occupies some [!!!!]5[!!!!]4 [SYMBOL] in. (exclud-
ing bark) from a stool diameter
17 in. Stool may thus be some

The remaining birch and
poplar trees in the fenced
part of the Meadow were
felled, except a few left for
shade.
A fire has consumed much
of the broom and scrub at
the end of the baulk.
The birch and poplar
was stacked after last year's
felling have been heavily

attacked by Stereum purpureum
and S. hirsutum, which are
fruiting together.
This poplar flowers later
than the one at Hayley.
A kestrel was seen hovering
for long periods in one place
near the Bourne railway bridge
on the B1046.
The birch and poplar
felled is a small grove on
the site of an earlier grove
which was also felled, as
shown by much-decayed stumps
and brushwood. Brambles are
vigorous under the trees.
Many birds roosted and there
were several elder bushes.
This wood was continuous
with the older birch and poplar

[9944-9945]
9944

on the Greensand Great Heath
adjoining.
The site of last year's felling
was densely overgrown with
poplar suckers and a few birch
coppice shoots. These were cut
back together with the brambles.

Violets (v. canina agg.) grow
