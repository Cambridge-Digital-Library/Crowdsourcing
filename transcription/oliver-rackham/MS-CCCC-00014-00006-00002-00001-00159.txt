[SYMBOL] 30:3:69 [SYMBOL] HOTEL PLAYA
[SYMBOL] CAMP DE MAR
[SYMBOL] ANDRAITX
Stone Walls [SYMBOL] MALLORCA
Some around Camp de Mar
newly built show an unusual
degree of perfection in the art.
Stones rough-hewn to polygonal
shape with such precision that
a knife ca[!!!!]nnot be inserted. In
hard limestone ([SYMBOL] 23) or calcar-
eous sandstone ([SYMBOL] 24).
Some older walls of this type
exist, e.g. a terrace wall at Camp
de Mar farm ([SYMBOL] 27).
Weather.
During the visit there was
great variety. Seldom warm. Rain
in Mar. 26, 27, and 29 for short
periods.

[12002-12003]

An early-morning frost was
reported on the beach one day.
No deciduous trees show any
signs of leaves.
Sea always calm. No opportu-
nity of observing it at night.
Inula viscosa.
Abundant along roadsides,
but less common than in S. France
Not an arable weed.
Erica multiflora.
A plant of scattered and some-
what inexplicable distribution. Around
Camp de Mar it is associated
with clays and marls, sometimes
(though not always) on old
cultivation terraces. In several
places (as on the road to P.
d'Andraitx) it appears to require
extra moisture.
This hypothesis of a somewhat
mesophytic drought-sensitive plant
agrees with its distribution in
deep soil on hard limestone on
Garrafa (p. 1851). Similar occurences
in the better soils at higher alti-
tudes in the Cordillera (p. 1818).
Its absence on Galatzo is
curious: only seen at c. 300m. under pines.
Some of these peculiarities can
be accounted for by supposing
that it is more exacting in the
extremely dry climate of low alti-
tudes in the [!!!!]W. corner of the
island.
Plantago psyllium and cynops.
Roadside rather than arable
weeds. They occasionally form
a dense turf on land that has
been a year since ploughing, as
near the road junction above Camp
de Mar.
Lavandula serrata.
Apparently confined to the W.
tip of the island, which is curious
because it occurs in abundance on
a variety of slopes and exposures
(including Garrafa). Always on
hard limestone. See p. 1747.
Asphodelus microcarpus.
One of the most widespread
plants in the island. Almost
universal. Sea level to c. 850m.
on Galatzo and 1000m. on Puig
Mayor. All soils including pockets
in hard limestone. Many plant
communities. The commonest plant
of roadsides and the most re-
sistant plant to the grazing of
swine. [!!!!] Very tolerant of shade.
See p. 1746.
Rhamnus oleoides.
A dwarf intricate spiny
shrub looking very like a small
form of Prunus spinosa. Abun-
dant on Formentor; here it
usually grows by itself as a
spalier[????]trauch against the rocks.
