[SYMBOL] 30:3:69 [SYMBOL] HOTEL PLAYA
[SYMBOL] CAMP DE MAR
[SYMBOL] ANDRAITX
Stone Walls [SYMBOL] MALLORCA
Some around Camp de Mar
newly built show an unusual
degree of perfection in the art.
Stones rough-hewn to polygonal
shape with such precision that
a knife ca[!!!!]nnot be inserted. In
hard limestone ([SYMBOL] 23) or calcar-
eous sandstone ([SYMBOL] 24).
Some older walls of this type
exist, e.g. a terrace wall at Camp
de Mar farm ([SYMBOL] 27).
Weather.
During the visit there was
great variety. Seldom warm. Rain
in Mar. 26, 27, and 29 for short
periods.

[12002-12003]

An early-morning frost was
reported on the beach one day.
No deciduous trees show any
signs of leaves.
Sea always calm. No opportu-
nity of observing it at night.
Inula viscosa.
Abundant along roadsides,
but less common than in S. France
Not an arable weed.
Erica multiflora.
A plant of scattered and some-
what inexplicable distribution. Around
Camp de Mar it is associated
with clays and marls, sometimes
(though not always) on old
cultivation terraces. In several
places (as on the road to P.
d'Andraitx) it appears to require
extra moisture.
This hypothesis of a somewhat
mesophytic drought-sensitive plant
agrees with its distribution in
deep soil on hard limestone on
Garrafa (p. 1851). Similar occurences
in the better soils at higher alti-
tudes in the Cordillera (p. 1818).
Its absence on Galatzo is
curious: only seen at c. 300m. under pines.
Some of these peculiarities can
be accounted for by supposing
that it is more exacting in the
extremely dry climate of low alti-
tudes in the [!!!!]W. corner of the

[12004-12005]

island.
Plantago psyllium and cynops.
Roadside rather than arable
weeds. They occasionally form
a dense turf on land that has
been a year since ploughing, as
near the road junction above Camp
de Mar.
Lavandula serrata.
Apparently confined to the W.
tip of the island, which is curious
because it occurs in abundance on
a variety of slopes and exposures
(including Garrafa). Always on
hard limestone. See p. 1747.
Asphodelus microcarpus.
One of the most widespread
plants in the island. Almost
universal. Sea level to c. 850m.
on Galatzo and 1000m. on Puig
Mayor. All soils including pockets
in hard limestone. Many plant
communities. The commonest plant
of roadsides and the most re-
sistant plant to the grazing of
swine. [!!!!] Very tolerant of shade.
See p. 1746.
Rhamnus oleoides.
A dwarf intricate spiny
shrub looking very like a small
form of Prunus spinosa. Abun-
dant on Formentor; here it
usually grows by itself as a
spalier[????]trauch against the rocks.

[12006-12007]

On Galatz[symbol] it mixes with
the other Igelheide bushes to
form mixed thickets.
Holoschoenus.
Rare; almost only at Camp
de Mar, where it occurs locally
in the beds of watercourses.
Arundo donax.
In addition to the occurence
in the Ensenada de las Hortigas
valley, there is a small bed in
the wady by the hotel.
Near Palma airfield there
are numerous pumping windmills
of the usual type.
March 28 [cont. p. 1912]
Andraitx.
A town laid out on a grid
pattern. Big barn-like church
with tiny external windows
and no architectural features.
Houses mainly 2-storeyed,
on the street, garden (if any)
at the side or back.
Architecture very like S.
France; the town looks very
like Le Touret (although more
prosperous).
froma[symbol]a = cheese.
North of the town is a dry
valley with mixed agriculture
leading up to Coll de sa Gre-
mola. This pass, though low, is
rugged, with a tunnel.

[12008-12009]

The contour road to Estall-
enchs is very fine. Steep slopes
and cliffs down to the sea. Another
tunnel.
Weather.
Very mixed. Generally
cold but bright. Strong winds
on summit. The rest of the
party at Ba[SYMBOL]albufar got soaked
by a thunderstorm. Dark clouds
seen around.
Snow was seen in sheltered
places in E. facing chimneys on
Galalz[SYMBOL], 950m.
Status of plant communities.
Oak woods.
[!!!!] Almost certainly primary.
Absence of cultivation remains;
unusually large number (for
Majorca) of woody species; defi-
nite woodland herbs.
Present condition uncertain.
The existence of apparently
recent kiln sites has to be re-
conciled with the apparent [!!!!]
[!!!!]rarity of coppice stools, although
none of the trees is [SYMBOL]100 years.
Possibly the charcoal sites are
older than they look; a logging
c. 80 years ago for charcoal
resulted in a large proportion of
seed regeneration. (Arbutus prob-
ably is coppiced). Failure of
oak to coppice might be at-
tributed to climate, soil, or
time of year. Felling old enough

[12010-12011]

for most stumps to have rotted
(a few visible, but this is prob-
ably due to more recent and
more local cutting).
Pine woods.
These form a plausible
altitudinal zone (especially on
the plateau) which might be
the natural home of pine.
[!!!!] There appears not to be
a characteristic ground vegetation.
The history of the boundary
between oak and pine is ob-
scure. There are a few stunted
oaks in the pine belt, which
suggests that oak may have
gone higher at one time.
Summit vegetation.
Closely comparable to Formen-
tor. It is again probable that
the severe climate keeps out
trees.
Note the numerous woodland
species, especially in deep or
shallow grykes, especially
characteristic of this zone:
Helleborus, Clematis cirrhosa,
Buxus balearica, &c. Because
of the isolation of the moun-
tain and the presence of restric-
ted Igelheide species, it is un-
likely that there ever was an
actual wood. Woodland species
were not so prominent at For-
mentor.
Garrigue species (Pistacia,

[12012-12013]

Asphodelus Urginea &c.) also ap-
pear above the oak and in
some cases much higher, which
argues a relatively frost-free
climate.
Wind pruning of such
vegetation as there is is not
severe.
Ampelodesmus (as elsewhere)
is quite enigmatic.
Pastinaca lucida may be
a woodland element (of [????]
Mayor).
April 3.
Madingley Wood.
Surveying for map.
Belt 1a.
This (with the [!!!!]north margin)
is clearly the oldest of the
belts. It has a massive
sinuous marginal wood-bank.
On the N. side the wood edge
is a lynchet rather than a
bank, because of the slope.
Belt 1b.
Although documentarily 18th
cent. this appears to be more
recent than 1a; apparently
straight, slighter wood-bank,
ditched off from 1a.

[12014-12015]

[DIAG]

[12016-12017]

Belt 1c.
Effectively not separated
from fields 4 and 5. No dit-
ches. The R & F in 4 and 5
are parallel but this belt
appears to have none; either
it was planted, or the
R & F is later.
Field 2
Definitely a first-generation
planting. Trees in rows (too
accurate to be determined by
the R & F). R & F spacing
paced out (see map).
Field 3.
R & F carefully looked for but
not found. Trees not in
rows; there are clearly 2 gen-
erations of which the larches
and some [!!!!] are older. The
part of the field in the ceme-
tery has been cleared of
bushes and the N. earthworks
destroyed.
Field 4.
R & F spacing paced out.
Evidence of a narrow double
bank (drfitway? marginal
belt?) cutting off the S.E.
corner and running into the
American cemetery. Big ashes
not accurately in rows;
the contrary impression from
the air is due to the trees

[12018-12019]

being confined to the ridges.
Much standing water. Haw-
[!!!!] thorn forms a dense
understorey to the ash and
(if the ash be planted) is
presumably later.
Field 5.
R & F spacing paced out.
Field 8.
Not ditched. Note that
mercury is abundant in the
northern 2/3 - as it is in all
the other secondary woodland.

9 April.
Madingley Wood (extra-mural
course in local history).
The S. ride near the gate
is blocked with several tall
fallen Prunus spinosa trees.
Party of about [!!!!]20 taken
round most of the historically
different areas.
12 April.
A blue-tit was seen to go
in and out of a nest in
the hollow top of the lamp
standard outside my window,
as last year.
15 April.
Little Whelnetham Spinney and
Link Wood.
Apparently parts of Rush-
brooke Park, planted up with
conifers.

[12028-12029]

Chensil Grove, Bradfields.
A coppice wood with very
sparse standards, apparently
2-layered. Signs of boundary
bank. Probably ancient. Fairly
recently cut.
In Maypole Green and
elsewhere in Bradfield St George,
there are several very large
pollard oaks set well back
from the road, possibly marking
the limits of an old wide
road.
Felsham Hall Wood and
Monks' Park Wood (general
survey with David Dymond).
To be done.
1. Map ground vegetation.
2. Map alders, willows, &c.
3. Map elm and determine
species.
4. Investigate effecr of cop-
picing on ground vegetation.
5. Study management of
heathland.
6. Transition between boulder
clay and heath woodland.
7. Map enclosures in N.W.
part of Monks' Park.
8. Precise distribution of prim-
roses & hybrids.
9. Record coppice methods & performance.
There is not much Filipen-
dula in either wood.

Recently-coppiced areas
do not show any great increase

pears to have been coppiced
within the last 10 years,
but only small areas within
2 years; around [SYMBOL]2 and [SYMBOL]3
and [!!!!]around [SYMBOL]10 between
the ride snd the ditch.
Growth of new copppice is
very dense and almost
impenetrable.
The boundary bank is
about 3ft high and rather
acute. Runs round the
whole perimeter. The banks
separating the N.W. handle
from the remaining wood are
very shallow. The outer bank
has a corner mound at the
S.E. corner. From here the
Felsham-Gedding boundary takes
off. It consists of a substan-
tial bank interrupted by a
pond. By the pond are
two minumental park-like
oaks some 4ft dia., and a
row of four sickly beeches
to c. 2ft dia.
"Fish Pond".
A flat-bottomed trench some

Felsham Hall Wood.
1. Active coppice management.
2. Remarkably vigorous coppice

7. Abundant Allium ursinum,
locally dominant.
8. Remarkably scarce hawthorn,
Mainly monogyna (no undoub-
