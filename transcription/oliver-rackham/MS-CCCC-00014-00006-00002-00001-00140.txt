Trebesing Kärnten 18 June 1969
Slavonian plain
A completely flat and mono-
tonous plain, though one is
never out of site of distant
mountains to the S. and seldom
out of sight of nearer hills
to the N., on which most of the
villages seen were built.
Mostly arable: mainly corn,
now reaped, large areas of
sunflowers, some root crops.
Large tracts of decidious
forest of unknown history,
though some clearly secondary
(see notes on individual stands).
Large areas of marshland
particularly near Sisak. Mainly
Phragarites fen, but varied in

[10498-10499]
498
vegetation and land use.
Churches mostly of the
Victorian Austrian type.

Slavonski brod.
The only place seen close to.
There is a lively but faceless
modern quarter. The older
town consists of numerous
wide dusty unsurfaced streets
lined with Robinia trees.
THey are bordered with small
houses, all 1 1/2 - storeyed, all
similar in size but differing
in detail, with small courtyards
entered through archways
(many are small farms), with
a long street range with the
roof parallel to the street and

499
a gable in the middle,
built of brick with interlocking
tile roofs, roofs low-pitched
with the eaves angle filled by
a round plaster cornice, walls
plastered. They greatly resemble
Salvonic Carinthian houses and
have such details as brick
tracery in barn windows.
Rather noisy with people
on foot (this late in the even-
ing) but very little traffic.
A curious village-like town
occupying a large area;
other similar places were
seen in the distance. Clean and
well-maintained.

Phragmites fen and other

[10500-10501]
500
wet lands contain numerous
willows and other trees, some
dead and dying which suggest
the water table has risen.

Slovenski Brodski Logor
June 19.
The entire road from Zagreb
to Belgrade is made of concrete
slabs about 10 ft square (i.e.
half width of road). These
are often tilted up to 6 in. at
one edge, also cracked and
the parts displaced sideways
with cracks opened up to 9 in.
wide. Traffic light, but many
heavy lorries.
South of Belgrade the road
is similar but newer and in
better condition. The whole of the
Jugoslav autoput is single-track.
There is a big contract in
scenery immediately on leaving
Belgrade and entering the hill
country.

503
Cynodon Dactylon forms a
substantial part of the turf at
the Slovenski Brod camp
site.
The road E. of Sl. Brod is
lined with Coichonium and
other composite skeleton weeds
and Verbasca of both the
nigrum & thapsus groups.
Galium verum is very abun-
dant.
Opposite Brčko is a 
large forest of closely spaced
uneven-aged oaks with
a few other spp similar in
size & shape: Fraxinus,
Salix alba, populis sp. Little
undergrowth. Trees c. 60 ft

[10504-10505]
504
high. Ash dying at [????]ps,
but not oak.
Slavonian hedges are
usually living, of privet and
other spp, but sometimes
dead and then made of
brushwood laid horizonally
and entwined with stakes
driven vertically at 3 - 4 ft
intervals.
Tree trunks are quite
well lichened but have no obvious
bryophytes.
Thatching with seeds is
sometimes practised in these
plains.
Another large forest is
still mainly oak (perhaps 80 ft
high) but with much beech

505
& hornbeam in addition to other
spp. No trees more than c. 1 1/2 ft
diam. Ash dying at the top.
Partial shrubb layer - herbs complete
No coppice. Occasional
1 - vehicle - wide rides.
Acer campestre occ. as
large shrub.
This forest extends for
several miles on either
side of the Llubanj river.
No dead or fallen trees seen.
No clearings or sporadic
felling order than c. 10 years.
Further there is a tract
of 2  1/2 miles of oak about
20 years old - monospecific,
not in rows, unthinned & 
closely spaced. Deer fence

[10506-10507]
506
9.15.10
c. 6 ft high of barbed wire
along one side of the road
Near the Bosut bridge.
Sunflowers are grown
just beyond the Bosut
now coming into flower.
Sambucus ebulus is 
frequent along this road
Veronica of longifilia
was once seen.
There are large plantations
of poplars & Robinia near Bel-
grade.
Near Belgrade, some of the
wheat had been cut & a small
proportion ploughed after.
Belgrade: about 1/8 of pub-
lic notices in the Latin
letters, 1/3 in Cyrillick, the

507
remainder in both.
Metamorphic Hills S. of Belgrade.
Very deep red soils.
Small-scale hills.
Largely strip fields: wheat,
maize, barley, rye, hay.
Hedges of Robinia &c.
Patches of low woodland
& šibljak.
Delphinium grows in abun-
dance on cuttings.
Villages few.
Few vines - some almond or
peach groves.
A brick-kiln.
Half-round tiles start c
20 miles S. of Belgrade.
Quercus Pubesces ap-
pears to form most of the woods.

[10508-10509]
508
Ploughing & carting mostly
with cows. Reaping with hooks
or scythes.
Lower Morava Valley.
Buildings traditionally of
wattle & daub or mud brick:
Occasional woods of
oak & elm: latter often
severely damaged as if by
Dutch elm disease.
Paračin has a large
Victorian-Italian domed church.
*Centaurea grown in prodi-
gious quantities by the road-
side at Paračin.
Eryngium Campestre ap-
pears just S. of Paračin.
Dianthus deltoides grows in 
great abundance a few miles

509
S. of Paračin.
Middle Moraca Valley
From Paračin onwards
the valley is wide and flat
bottomed with very distant 
hills. Entirely cultivated.
Irrigation is by wells
each provided with a 
crane of two tree
trunks. The
upright is forked
[DIAG]

[10510-10511]
510
Middle Morava Valley: АЛЕК-
СИИАЦ onwards.
Wooded hills with patchy pasture. Woodland mostly 
deciduous. Valley floor cul-
tivated , as before.
Cotinus appears on
cuttings.
Mainly champaign [????]
[SYMBOL]
to take a boom pivoted near 
the root end of the tree
and counterweighted with a
bucket of stones. The crane
lowers a bucket down the
well and waters a garden
within its radium. In some 
villages each house has one.
They are about 30 ft highš. Archaeological Museum.

area between Paračin and
Kragujevac.

[10512-10513]
512
Niš is a town of dilapi-
dated and somewhat undis-
tinguished buildings. It is
Roman Nissa of which con-
siderable remains have been
found, including a bronze
head and other bronze
stationary also a statue in
imperial porphyry.
Belgrade is a city of un-
distinguished Victorian and
later buildings in tree-lined
dusty avenues. The castle is
the only notable building seen,
buy though picturesquely sited
in a bend of the great river it
appears to have been much
rebuilt.

513
S. of Niš there are exposures
of shales. To the E. of the 
Morava, high mountains
(probably not limestone_ appear.
A strip of fall lupine
was seen as a crop c. 20
miles S. of Niš.

Upper Morava. At Vranje.
Wide very shallow torrential
river.
Mountains with shale ex-
posed in artificial cuttings,
covered with several feet of
terra rossa perhaps de-
rived from Löfs.
Forests mainly a tall [????]
near oak. Low forest and
Šibljak on W. facing slopes.

[10514-10515]
514
Cultivation & grassland
cover much of the area
even on steep slopes.
Vranje itself is in a
large cultivated p[????]
rounded by similar hills.
Further S. the Morava
Valley becomes more swampy
but still cultivated for
hay. Water buffaloes are
used near Biljača.
Around Komonovo are
several villages with tall
white shining minarets.
The terra rossa is particu-
larly brilliant.
A ruined mosque just
over the Macedon border
is a small rectangular

515
building with a stone roof.
[DIAG]
The outside of the roof rises in
a series of steps.
Water Buffalo.
Much used from Bil-
jača to Skoplje abd beyond
to Katlanovo.
Black animals rather
larger than most cattle, with
the build of ordinary cows,
and large curved sharp
swept-back horns.

[10516-10517]
516
Datura sp. occurs on a
roadside near Skoplje.
They were seen in har-
ness (sometimes in company
with horses) and also in
large numbers at a time
being herded on unenclosed
grasslands. Sometimes
herded in company with 
cattle. Not usually in
water although the muddy
Morava flows nearby.
No Mediterranean vegeta-
tion seen this day: in general
it is comparable with Central
France.
Elm (a carpinifolia type) is
notably more frequent S. than W. of
Belgrade, but occurs as scrub rather
than tall woodland or isolated trees.

517
June 20. 
Kumanovo Makedonija
Camp site at Katlanovo.
Tall sawrd of Cynodon

Vardar Gorge between
Katlanovo & Titor Veles.
Rocks mainly metamorphic
but some limestone.
Submediterranean vegetation
starts abruptly c. 5 miles S.
of Katlanovo. Sparse wood-
land except on very steep
slopes. Elsewhere scattered
bushes & patches of scrub
among grassland.
Palinus begins abruptly
and becomes v. ab. in scrub.
Much used for dead hedges.
Fraxinus Ornus v. ab.

vines & fruit trees.
A few carob trees occur
at Titov Veles.
Cultivation done by oxen
& buffaloes. Many asses.
An ancient oriental plane
by the roadside at Titov Veles.

tyres & a long draught pole.
2 tortoises were seen on 
the road just N. of T. Veles.
Echinops occurs just
S.E. of T. Veles. 
Pistacia Terebinthus occurs
from just N. of T. Veles.
Scolymus is abundant
from T. Veles.

[10520-10521]
520
The Morava, Vardar,
& Crna Reka are bright
golden brown with silt.
2 storks awere seen in
the fields near Negotino.
The Macedonians keep
bees in large separate non-
-sectional hives.

Beyond the tunnel at Ban-
ja the Mediterranean bush
begins. Scrub of:
Oleaster
Juniperus oxycedrus
Phillyrea
Clematis flammula
Platanus orientalis - also
a small tree in the rover
bed.

521
Erica arborea
Pal[????]us: less freq. and
mainly near the road
Buxus: infreq.
There is very little inclo-
sure in Macedonia, either in 
the mountains or the plains.
Cultivations are occasionally
enclosed by dead Pa[????]
hedges.
The Kožuf range is
densely forested up to c. 1200 m.
with some cleanings. The 
summits are clear of forest
and have some high cliffs. Prob-
ably limestone.
No water buffaloes were
seen S. of Negotino in Jugo-
slav Macedonia.

[10522-10523]
522
Thessalonian Plain.
A vast undulating plain,
almost treelessl almost
entirely cereals which have
all been recently cut (with
combines).
Scolymus, a whitish species
of Echium, and a blue Eryn-
gium are abundant along
roadsides.
Arundo donax was seen near
Βαθ[????]λαϰϰos.
Rice is not much grown
in the Thessalonian plain, but
some was seen near Γίδα.
Grown in rectangular enclo-
sures with shallow earthen
dykes flooded by irriga-
tion.

523

ΟΛΥΜΒΟΣ: The Mount of
the Gods is separated from the
sea by a plain about 3 miles
wide from which the slope begins
abruptly and continues to the
top. The slopes are continuous
on the outside but the top is 
a horseshoe-shaped Kar with
formidable cliffs on the inside.
It opens into a ravine on
the seaward side. There are
apparently large forests on the
upper slopes with an irregular
tree-line at about 2200 m.
There is no continuous snow
on the summit, but small
areas of old snow extend down-
wards to c. 2400 m.

[10524-10525]
524
Inula viscosa is abun-
dant along the Olympic coast.
The lower slopes of Kato
Olympos are metamorphic
rocks with deeply weathered
red soils and low maquis
including Erica arborea, Phil-
lyrea, & c.
Paliurus is less fre-
quent on the Olympic coast &
mostly in disturbed areas.
Acanthus very frequent,
on roadsides.
Vitex frequent near the
Peneus estuary.

Ossa is an elegant cone
with several foothills. Probably
not extensively high forested.

525
The N. side is very dense maquis
the S. side patchy low scrub.
The cone above c. 1600 m.
appears to be grassland
Another stork's rest was seen
on a corner of a ruin at
ΑpΧiaλοs.
The Volos hills are largely
limestone, with complete scrub
cover in places and about 60%
elsewhere.
The Larissa and Volos plains
are vast wheat-lands, u[????]in closed,
with small areas of maize
and other crops. Barley in places
is not quite reaped. Very scat-
tered olive, pear, & plane trees.
No evident field systems. Soil
latentic, easily eroded where

[10526-10527]
526
exposed.
The W. end of Euboea
is very mountainous and
forested with broad-leaved
woods right to the s[????]-
[????]it. Apparently limestone.
The extreme tip is culti-
vated.
On the N. coast of the
Maliac Gulf are vast olive
groves. Trees uneven-aged, up
to c. 2 ft diam., some recently
planted. Ground ploughed
underneath, sometimes
planted with maize &c. No
stone walls: in places the
stones have been gathered into
heaps.
A small group of Pinus

527
Pinea was seen planted at
Lamia.
A small island off the W. tip
of Euboea is densely wooded, in 
contrast to the mainland coast
and all but the steepest coasts
of Euboea. Another island in
the same area, connected to the
mainland by a mole, is
cover by single bushes.
Locris and Attica have con-
siderable tracts of Punus halepen-
sis woodland. Trees usually spaced
about 1 crown - width apart,
with understorey of Erica arborea
and similar tall shrubs. This
woodland occurs up to at
least 300 m. and down
to the coast in some places.

[10528-10529]
528
Boeotia in contrast is
very sparsely wooded. The
plain of Thebes is another 
vast and entirely treeless [!!!!]very sparsely wooded[!!!!]
corn-land, now about 2/3
harvested. To the N. is a
limestone hill-country with
sparse low garrigue but
never any large areas of
bare rock. In the limestone
are numerous caves, some
of which have store-sheds and
even dwelling-houses built
against their months. In
the hills is a large clear-
-water lake, the level of
which has sunk recently some
loft leaving a bare shore-
-line. [Ύλί[????]η Παραλία]

529
The soils of the Boeotian
hills are a brilliant terra
rossa developed on deeply
fissured limestone. Erosion
(more severe than anywhere
else seen in Greece) has
left about 1/3 of the surface
covered in bare rock. Be-
tween the rock outcrops are
pairs & hallows in which
water appears to stand. The
garrigue bushes are apparently
mainly at the edges of the
hollows.
The soils of Locris & Attica,
although also terrae rosse, are
derived at least in part from
metamorphic rocks and much
less eroded.

[10530-10531]
530
Euboea is particularly
rugged on the inner side
and has tall white cliffs in
the S.W. side of Kandilion.
Dirlys and Olympus are also
visible from the chast.
Paliurus occurs frequently
all down Greece usually as
a taller bush among low
maquis. It is not usually 
used as fencing.

Thebes.
Seen in the distance as
a small town on a hill,
probably a very large tell.

Vale of Tempe.
A limestone gorge where the

531
Peneus leaves the Thessalian
plain. It has lost all its woods
and is now covered with continuous
scrub. There are fine groves
of plane trees fringing the river.
Although the gorge is precipitous
the river is quite slow.
Bracken occurs in the gorge.
Sambucus Ebulus occurs
just outside its mouth.

Titor Veles.
An ancient and picturesque
town. Buildings of stone
or brick, several stories,
plastered, with "Roman" tiles.
No Greek influence.
Street traffic is almost
all horse-drawn.

[10532-10533]
532
Buffaloes were not seen
beyond about 5 miles S.
of Katlanovo.
Two large tortoises were
seen on the road in Locris.
Kumanovo.
The camp-site is in a
flat valley overlooked by roun-
ded hills with scrub. No other
habitation in sight.

The Skoplje basin is a vast
plain surrounded by rather rugged
mountains.
Near Gradsko is the place
where the autoput comes to an
abrupt end at the top of a 
cliff. A sign now warns the

533
traveller to turn left onto the
old road, but according to the
Warrens this was not there last 
time.
The Vardar from Smokvica
to Gevgelija and on into Greece
passes through a long grassy
plain overlooked by the distant
and lonely Flora in the Kožuf
range.
At Ενξιovoι we stopped for
a drink in the wide main
street lined with flat-roofed
1- and 2-storeyed houses. There
is a great contrast with Serbo-
macedonia, where buildings have
tiled roofs and are not white=
washed.
Γεϕuρa marks the great
iron bridge over the many channels

[10534-10535]
534
if the Aξιòs.
Numerous groves of poplars
long the Olympic coast.

Λáρισa is a small town
with intricate streets. Houses all
- or 2-storeyed, mostly flat-roofed,
[????]one picturesque or with any
[????]etensions to antiquity. Dusty
[????]eepy main square lined with trees.
The place has a curiously [????]-
-down appearance without much
actual dilapidation.
The head of the Maliac
Gulf has large tracts of undrained
[????]hragmites fen. Οθρυs is an
inconspicuous range in the dis-tance.

θερμοωυλαι is a broken
limestone slope running down to
[????] tract of reclaimed marsh at

535
its foot. It is covered with maqu[????]
No springs seen. The arrange-
ments at the time of the battle
are by no means obvious, espe-
cially now that the road has
but into the base of the hillside.
Pronounced lateritic soil The
καλλιδρομον range at the back
is barren and rugged. The built
-up coast of M[????[λαsϰ begins a
few miles further on.
The site of Lake Copias is 
a great plain with numerous
tracts of poplar trees. This is se-
parated by karst country from the
lonely Ὑλίκφ Пαραλία.
The brilliant blue Eryngium
creticum is abundant by road-
sides in Boeotia and Attica.
Olive groves occur in Attica

[10536-10537]
536
in open country, but more
abundantly in the approached to
the city.

Athens is in a vast basin
between Παρνφs and Πεντελφ,
two fairly rugged mountains 
in the distance; they are clothed
with evergreen scrub, possibly
forests in places. The town
is on an immense slop down
to the sea. The chief emi-
nence is ΛυχαΒφττοs, an
abrupt sugar-loaf crag rising
aout of the suburbs near the
British School.
The grounds of the Brit-
ish School contain numerous

537

Pinus halepensis trees and
some eucalypts. Oleander is
commonly planted.
Nests, presumably of pro-
cessional caterpillars, are fre-
quent in the pines.
Robinia and Schinus are
frequent street trees in Athens.
June 22.
Mosquitoes are present
but not particularly numer-
ous. 
Many small ants' nests in
the gardens.
Cicadas occur.
The rocky hills in the ancient
part of Athens have sparse
Pinus halepensis with occa-
sional olives and other trees.
A curious shrub is common

[10538-10539]
538
on the AreopagusL about 2 ft
high, with ovate entire leaves,
intensely white-woolly. Re-
mains of composite heads.
Possibly an Otanthus.
June 23. 
Temp. 30.0°, wet bulb 19.2°. 9 pm
These days in Athens
have been hot and hazy, very
humid and stuffy, with an
uncomfortable land wind.
A small olive tree is planted
in the Erechtheion on the site
of the ancient sacred olive.
Cynodon is a common grass
in lawns and waste places.
Phoenix canariensis is the 
most commonly cultivated palm;
large trees are frequent.
Bird life is scarce.
Orange and other citrus trees

539
are frequent. Olives rather
scarce. Eucalyptus spp commonly
planted.
Athens and the Piraeus
are continuous; the latter dom-
inated by the marble quarries
on a spur of the Πευτελφ.
The E. shore of the Saronic
Gulf is largely built up. This
coast is uninteresting.
The Saronic Gulf is a 
deep blue intensifying and
becoming purplish in the evening.
No phosphorescence seen. The
sun going down was very im-
pressive, with the rugged moun-
tains of Salamis & Ægina, and
the long hills of the eastern
Peleponnese.

peaks in a row, said to be
the sleeping Zeus.
The interior is bare rolling
brown hills, the highest being
Ida, a long hog's back with
few small patches of snow
(Peter W. says it is an unu-
sually snow-free year).

We went to Mme Varouka's
in Idaean - Cave Street, where
the warrens had lodged before.
She was delighted to see us
and produced some cake from
a tin. Before we could eat
it, a large cat had sprung
on the table, seized the largest

547
piece, and made off with it.
(About 8 a.m.). She has 3
cats. Peter W. sees a resem-
blance in some of the Cretan
cats to those in Egyptian
tomb paintings.
Cats were also encountered
when eating (in the usual
Cretan manner) in the
street of an evening, out-
side one of the better inns
in Heracleion, as guests of
the Director of Heracleion mu-
seum. They meeowed for food
and when refused jogged the
eater's elbow with their skulls
and tried to climb on the
table.
There appears to be no
