Trebesing Kärnten 18 June 1969
Slavonian plain
A completely flat and mono-
tonous plain, though one is
never out of site of distant
mountains to the S. and seldom
out of sight of nearer hills
to the N., on which most of the
villages seen were built.
Mostly arable: mainly corn,
now reaped, large areas of
sunflowers, some root crops.
Large tracts of decidious
forest of unknown history,
though some clearly secondary
(see notes on individual stands).
Large areas of marshland
particularly near Sisak. Mainly
Phragarites fen, but varied in

[10498-10499]
498
vegetation and land use.
Churches mostly of the
Victorian Austrian type.

Slavonski brod.
The only place seen close to.
There is a lively but faceless
modern quarter. The older
town consists of numerous
wide dusty unsurfaced streets
lined with Robinia trees.
THey are bordered with small
houses, all 1 1/2 - storeyed, all
similar in size but differing
in detail, with small courtyards
entered through archways
(many are small farms), with
a long street range with the
roof parallel to the street and

499
a gable in the middle,
built of brick with interlocking
tile roofs, roofs low-pitched
with the eaves angle filled by
a round plaster cornice, walls
plastered. They greatly resemble
Salvonic Carinthian houses and
have such details as brick
tracery in barn windows.
Rather noisy with people
on foot (this late in the even-
ing) but very little traffic.
A curious village-like town
occupying a large area;
other similar places were
seen in the distance. Clean and
well-maintained.

Phragmites fen and other

[10500-10501]

wet lands contain numerous
willows and other trees, some
dead and dying which suggest
the water table has risen.

Slovenski Brodski Logor
June 19.
The entire road from Zagreb
to Belgrade is made of concrete
slabs about 10 ft square (i.e.
half width of road). These
are often tilted up to 6 in. at
one edge, also cracked and
the parts displaced sideways
with cracks opened up to 9 in.
wide. Traffic light, but many
heavy lorries.
South of Belgrade the road
is similar but newer and in
better condition. The whole of the
Jugoslav autoput is single-track.
There is a big contract in
scenery immediately on leaving
Belgrade and entering the hill
country.

503
Cynodon Dactylon forms a
substantial part of the turf at
the Slovenski Brod camp
site.
The road E. of Sl. Brod is
lined with Coichonium and
other composite skeleton weeds
and Verbasca of both the
nigrum & thapsus groups.
Galium verum is very abun-
dant.
Opposite Brčko is a 
large forest of closely spaced
uneven-aged oaks with
a few other spp similar in
size & shape: Fraxinus,
Salix alba, populis sp. Little
undergrowth. Trees c. 60 ft

[10504-10505]
504
high. Ash dying at [????]ps,
but not oak.
Slavonian hedges are
usually living, of privet and
other spp, but sometimes
dead and then made of
brushwood laid horizonally
and entwined with stakes
driven vertically at 3 - 4 ft
intervals.
Tree trunks are quite
well lichened but have no obvious
bryophytes.
Thatching with seeds is
sometimes practised in these
plains.
Another large forest is
still mainly oak (perhaps 80 ft
high) but with much beech

505
& hornbeam in addition to other
spp. No trees more than c. 1 1/2 ft
diam. Ash dying at the top.
Partial shrubb layer - herbs complete
No coppice. Occasional
1 - vehicle - wide rides.
Acer campestre occ. as
large shrub.
This forest extends for
several miles on either
side of the Llubanj river.
No dead or fallen trees seen.
No clearings or sporadic
felling order than c. 10 years.
Further there is a tract
of 2  1/2 miles of oak about
20 years old - monospecific,
not in rows, unthinned & 
closely spaced. Deer fence

c. 6 ft high of barbed wire
along one side of the road
Near the Bosut bridge.
Sunflowers are grown
just beyond the Bosut
now coming into flower.
Sambucus ebulus is 
frequent along this road
Veronica of longifilia
was once seen.
There are large plantations
of poplars & Robinia near Bel-
grade.
Near Belgrade, some of the
wheat had been cut & a small
proportion ploughed after.
Belgrade: about 1/8 of pub-
lic notices in the Latin
letters, 1/3 in Cyrillick, the

507
remainder in both.
Metamorphic Hills S. of Belgrade.
Very deep red soils.
Small-scale hills.
Largely strip fields: wheat,
maize, barley, rye, hay.
Hedges of Robinia &c.
Patches of low woodland
& šibljak.
Delphinium grows in abun-
dance on cuttings.
Villages few.
Few vines - some almond or
peach groves.
A brick-kiln.
Half-round tiles start c
20 miles S. of Belgrade.
Quercus Pubesces ap-
pears to form most of the woods.

[10508-10509]
508
Ploughing & carting mostly
with cows. Reaping with hooks
or scythes.
Lower Morava Valley.
Buildings traditionally of
wattle & daub or mud brick:
Occasional woods of
oak & elm: latter often
severely damaged as if by
Dutch elm disease.
Paračin has a large
Victorian-Italian domed church.
*Centaurea grown in prodi-
gious quantities by the road-
side at Paračin.
Eryngium Campestre ap-
pears just S. of Paračin.
Dianthus deltoides grows in 
great abundance a few miles

509
S. of Paračin.
Middle Moraca Valley
From Paračin onwards
the valley is wide and flat
bottomed with very distant 
hills. Entirely cultivated.
Irrigation is by wells
each provided with a 
crane of two tree
trunks. The
upright is forked

Middle Morava Valley: АЛЕК-
СИИАЦ onwards.
Wooded hills with patchy pasture. Woodland mostly 
deciduous. Valley floor cul-
tivated , as before.
Cotinus appears on
cuttings.
Mainly champaign [????]

the root end of the tree
and counterweighted with a
bucket of stones. The crane
lowers a bucket down the
well and waters a garden
within its radium. In some 
villages each house has one.
They are about 30 ft highš. Archaeological Museum.

Niš is a town of dilapi-
dated and somewhat undis-
tinguished buildings. It is
Roman Nissa of which con-
siderable remains have been
found, including a bronze
head and other bronze
stationary also a statue in
imperial porphyry.
Belgrade is a city of un-
distinguished Victorian and
later buildings in tree-lined
dusty avenues. The castle is
the only notable building seen,
buy though picturesquely sited
in a bend of the great river it
appears to have been much
rebuilt.

513
S. of Niš there are exposures
of shales. To the E. of the 
Morava, high mountains
(probably not limestone_ appear.
A strip of fall lupine
was seen as a crop c. 20
miles S. of Niš.

Upper Morava. At Vranje.
Wide very shallow torrential
river.
Mountains with shale ex-
posed in artificial cuttings,
covered with several feet of
terra rossa perhaps de-
rived from Löfs.
Forests mainly a tall [????]
near oak. Low forest and
Šibljak on W. facing slopes.

Cultivation & grassland
cover much of the area
even on steep slopes.
Vranje itself is in a
large cultivated [!!!!]plantation[!!!!]
rounded by similar hills.
Further S. the Morava
Valley becomes more swampy
but still cultivated for
hay. Water buffaloes are
used near Biljača.
