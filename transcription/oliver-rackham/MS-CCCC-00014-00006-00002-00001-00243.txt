LAVENDER COTTAGE            8797
GREAT WALDINGFIELD
1 January.
   The rose in the front is
flowering well.
The old decayed fence along
the front garden was taken down.
2 January.
  The Ransons are troubled with
a rat in the roof, which it is
feared may eat the electric
wiring - during the building ex-
tension a cable was found with
both cores exposed by the P.V.C.
insulation being eaten away.
The animal picks out bits of
oatmeal bait to eat, leaving
the ratsbane mixed therewith 
untouched.
3 January.
At 9.53 a.m. I was being
taken to Sudbury when there was
[18798-18799]
8798
a remarkable storm blowing up
from the north.  An intense black
cloud with white lightning at
frequent intervals and loud
thunder - but the latter was
soon difficult to hear for the
wind. Sudden heavy fall of snow
turning to hail, lying and
driving against vertical surfaces.
Although the weather has been
warm a layer of wet ice soon
formed on roads. The hail
was driven horizontally by a
steady wind, prob. force 8.
I have never seen such a com-
bination of wind and hail, nor
such a squall.  It lasted about
10 min.
  Hail lay on the ground
all the way to Bury and Cam-
8799
bridge and remained most of 
the day.
  Between Cockfield and Great
Bradfield an ash tree had
been snapt off and a lime blown
over the road. Wind from NNW.
  At Newmarket the squall
had been more severe. By the
station I noticed that the two
great chimneystacks of the Coron-
ation Hotel had been blown 
down, partly through the roof,
and most of the peg-tiles blown
away.  Many other roofs, par-
ticularly of cement tiles, dam-
aged. Some station fittings
wrecked. It was said that
in the signasl-box, which was
shifted on its plinth, the clock
stopped st 9.23. (15 miles
[18800-18801]
8800
from Sudbury). No trees seen
blown down.
  No damage observed in
Cambridge.
4 Jan.      [DIAG]
  Two great elms (Uh, rather
like Huntingdon) somewhat
affected by DED at King's 
School have been felled.
6 Jan.
  Severe frost in  the early
night - puddles frozen hard by
10 p.m. Later came cloudy
and thawed.
10 Jan.
  W. Palmer's "potter's wheel"
Christmas Rose is flowering well.
  The Garrya at Elm Green
Bradfield is close to flowering
very well.
8801
  The Kentwell Avenue seems 
to be unaffected.
11 Jan.
  The mildest day for many
years.
  Heavy rain all morning,
turning to snow in the afternoon.
The wind got up, by 5 p.m.
it was too strong to cycle against
in the dark. Almost due N.,
very gusty. Snow turned to
rain, and then ceased. The
snow lay about 1 in. thick
and then slowly melted. Wind
reached its height about 5.30
and then irregularly moderated.
  The following trees blew down
at Leckhampton:
One large & 2 small cherry-
-plums in the lane
[18802-18803]
8802
Great deodar S.W. of the
croquet-lawn: uprooted
Arbutus by the deodar -
multi-stemmed, split asunder.
Pinus griffithii beyond the
deodar - uprooted.
 Atlantic cedar by the swim-
ming-pool - uprooted into pool.
  A great deal of deadwood
has come down, more than in
earlier storms (which did not
fell any trees).
12 Jan.
Botanic Garden,
Large branch (c. 1 1/2 ft dia.) split
from base of horsechestnut by
gale: included pocket of bark.
Another horsechestnut lost a
similar limb in an earlier gale
for the same reason.
8803
  Weeping Larch: this was a
grafted tree c. 1 ft dia. The
trunk snapt off about 3 ft above
the graft and proved to be
wholly rotten, the inside powdery,
with a shell of about 1/2 in. of 
sound wood.
  Middlesized branch broken 
from top of big poplar near
lake.
  Buildings unaffected.
  Hawthorn with Russian Vine
collapsed.
  Several smallish conifers in
The Spinney partly uprooted.
  Cedars undamaged.

An exceedingly cold brilliant
day with snow lying all day.
Some further falls. Total about
1 1/2 in. thick.
[18804-18805]
8804
Jan. 13.
  Great beech fallen at the
Roman Catholic Church. About 
3 ft. diameter c. 80 ft high.
Forked at the base into two
trunks very close together, which
were partly united in the lower
5 ft but largely separated by a
fold of bark with included roots.
They split apart compLetely in
the fall. Roots poorly devel-
oped, esp. in the northern half which
was covered by a concrete road.
Decay had begun at the
included bark and had spread
outwards; all the wood was
still present, but full of zone
lines. Inner roots were dead.
Completely squashed a car
and damaged another.
8805
[DIAG] 
Fell due S.

  Yesterday evening there
had been a slight thaw fol-
lowed by a clear night of very
severe frost. Black ice all
over pavements - more slippery
than I have ever known 
Cambridge.
  Leckhampton swimming-
pool frozen.
  Snow continued lying
today. 
  A middlesized Ulmus procera
[18806-18807]
8806
 on Clare Piece has snapped
off about 10 ft above ground - this
is the second half of a narrow fork
half of which broke in the gales
a year ago.
8807
Jan. 14.
  Petersfield.
  2 limes uprooted. One from
N, the other from N.N.E.
To the S. of a big group of
limes.
  The trees grow in gravelly soil,
with at least 2 ft of successive
layers of brickbats, pottery &
clay. Only small roots have
penetrated below the made earth;
the big ones are all sauperficial
and have partly dragged & partly
broken. Ground very wet. Trunk
about 1 1/2 ft dia. Root mats 
about 8 ft dia.
  One tree has a strong root
mat where the roots have failed to
penetrate a layer of clinker 
about 1 ft down.
[18808-18809]
8808
  Nearby on a Victorian
house at the corner uf Mortimer
Road a large 4-flue chimney
stack has toppled and lies in
one piece against an [????]
roof.

8811
Jan. 18.
  Heavy snowfall much of the
day, lying several inches thick.
Jan. 19.
  About 4 in. snow in the 
morning after a night of hard
frost. Snow extends all the way 
to London and to Wye in Kent.
  Houses differ markedly in
their roof-insulation: the better-
insulated roofs keep the snow, while
on about half the houses it has
melted already.
Petts Wood, Chislehurst. Mainly
birch.
Bourne Wood, Swanley. Much chest-
nut, recently coppiced.
Wood at Noah's Ark, Kemsing. Ano-
ther chestnut wood, coppiced.
[18812-18813]

20 Jan.   WYE COLLEGE
  The town of Wye has many
notable timber-framed buildings.
Much of it belongs to the College
and is used as students' rooms.
  Olantigh Park has some fine
but not ancient trees. The house
is a grest 20th-cent. mansion re-
placing a Palladian one consumed
in a great fire.
  The College has a magnificent
medieval barn by the church at
Brook.
  The steep scarp of the Downs is
much overgrown with ash and haw-
thorn; some grassland remains.
  Lanes in thia area have mixed
hedges.
Hoad's Woiod, Hothfield & Bethersden.
Almost entirely coniferized.
8813
The Forest, Pluckley & Bethersden.
Largely old conifers; perhaps never
a wood.
Dering Wood. Intact; much chest-
nut.
Snow persisted all day.
21 Jan.     [DIAG]
  Snow begins to thaw. Frost
was never particularly severe.
There was no skating.
22 Jan.
  Felling horsechestnut 21. A
difficult tree: had to be felled
along the length of the avenue,
which was managed with a rope.
Moderate-sized, with a low narrow
fork. No wetwood at any point,
nor any Phytophthora-type exud-
ation.
[18814-18815]

wastelands to the N. are
flooded in hollows and
frozen.

Gradient of 1 in 230 from Ely
to Chettisham, 1 in 223 down the
other side.

Ouse Waters. Full as far as
the eye can see. Small waves
and little white horses.  Only
trees project: no posts or
grasses visible. Water level
2-4 ft below level of banks.
Blue colour with tinge of
brown.
  Small flock of fowl
sheltering by railway embank-
ment.
8819
  E. of Whittlesey station, by
Inham's End Works, is a tract of
several acres of reedbeds with
sallow and sparse birch coloniza-
tiion.
Nene Washes. The W. end is
1/4-1/3 flooded (over permanent
grass). E. of Grid 23 the water
becomes continuous, and the
whole width of the wash is
under water as far as the eye
can see. The wash is almost
flat, but slightly lower on its
N. side.
  The Nene at Peterboro' is
now much higher than the Cam,
with a strong current, overflowing
much of the towpath.
[18820-18821]
8820
Rutland Water. Now full,
the level is that of the Gwash
just above Manton railway
bridge. Brilliant blue
among snowy hills.

  Canal immediatelly S. of
Leicester is thinly frozen.

  Between Leicester and Hinck-
ley: hedges mostly straight, well-
-trimmed; much elm; hedgerow
trees otherwise chiefly ash;
now about 3/4 arable, some of
it recent: much curving
R & F.
  The Irwell is quite as grim
as one expects it to be. Vast
black scum - derelict buildings from
the cliffs to its inky waters.
8821
Bridges of black stone and brick.
An iron bridge leads nowhere.
From one of the bridges a rotten
wooden stairway leads down to
a half-collapsed iron staging
cantilevered out halfway down 
the river wall, covered in litter
and objects thrown from above.

amore trees or by thorn scrub.
  The woods at Grindleford,
Abbeydale, Ecclesall, Totley and
[18822-18823]
8822
Beauchief are all very simi-
lar: oaks of varying density, usu-
aly rather evenaged, with vary-
ing numbers of probably younger
sycamores. No trace of u/w.
  Icicles hang round hte
mouths of tunnels and are
dislodged with a disconcerting
clatter by trains.
  Fine snowy landscape in the
north of Derbyshire. Snow is said
to be rare in Manchester.
  Route of boat-train from 
Manchester:Cowburn Tunnel-
Edale-Hope-Totley Tunnel- Shef-
field-Chesterfield-Nottingham-
Grantham-Peterboro'-Ely (-Harwich).
11 Feb. 
  Further fall of snow in Cam-
8823
bridge: horseplay at St Catharine's.
12 Feb.
More snow, bringing total depth
to about 3 in. Snow lies on the 
frozen backwaters of the Cam, but
the river itself is unfrozen.
  Large masses of snow cling to
evergreen trees.
  Track of a rabbit wandering
somewhat aimlessly across Leck-
hampton garden from the playing-
field and back again.
  Some work has been done on
trimming the broken stumps of
fallen trees on Sheep's Green and
removing the debris. Those in
Leckhampton are so big as to re-
quire a contractor to move them.
13 Feb.
  Snow still lying.
[18824-18825]
8825
  The great elm  at the E. end
of Burrell's Walk (Trin. Fellows' Garden) has been cut
down. Ulmus procera-type,
but rather crooked and diffuse in
growth-habit. About 80 ft high.
Had shown slight symptoms 
for 3-4 years back, branches
lacking vigour, losing leaves
early, and sometimes dying;
symptoms more characteristic
of severe wetwood than DED

of strong wetwood stain.
  In branches there is some
DED-like staining in early
wood of this year.
  In places the '73 DED

RAVELEY (MOOR-END) WOOD
-card only
  The wood is bordered by a
large square moat. Three corners
of the mound have internal mounds;
one mound bears a pollard ash;
another has one ancient pollard
elm; the third has an ancient
maple.
  Hummocks and hollows of a
deserted settlement outside the
moat.
  Snow has melted, save in hollows
and in shaded parts of the wood.
Much ice remains on ponds etc.;
the Barcley moat could be

1 March
  A patch of snowdrops grows
on the site of a ruined orchard
in the meadows at Ely.  It has
spread a few yards to adjoining
meadows.
  Ouse Washes almost covered
except for a narrow strip along
the S.E. side, but water is now
less deep than 3 weeks ago: it
has gone down by about 3 ft.
Fruiting of Ash. About 1 ash-tree
in 5 in the Midlands this year.
  Rutland Water is very high
and has drowned some hedgerow
trees in Manton.   
  The thickening of elms pre-
paratory to flowering has been
visible in some trees in Cambridge 
since December. It is now
[18834-18835]
8834
general but not very marked.
  The Oakham Canal is inter-
sected by the railway cutting
and quite waterless, except in
Stapleford Park.
  Stapleford Park is hardly
different from ordinary farm-
land.  It has many hedges &
lines of old hedgerow trees. The
pale is mostly visible though
decayed: post-&-rails with
vertical pales.

Brentingby. Church roofless
and recently half-collapsed;
tower & spire stand.

2 March.  LEICESTER
LAUNDE.
  The environs of Launde Abbey

oak around the gravelpits between
Alresford & Wivenhoe.
By the railway at Alresford
8839
is  very extensive elm and thorn
woodland, probably recent. Small
chestnut stools in places. Some
DED.

Severe DED in Wivenhoe Park.

Colchester High Woods.
  Not visibly altered.
  The grassland between the wood
& the railway - an area of planning
blight - is slowly becoming invaded
by scattered hawthorns. There has
been some grazing within the year.

  Lavatera arborea grows in
gardens on the scarp of the old 
cliff at Clacton. Most of the
leaves have been killed by frost but
the apices and young leaves remain

  Slight fall of hail in morning.

Elms. Huntingdon in full and
quite copious flower all round
Cambridge.
  Old elm in the bus station
is flowering moderate to sparsely.
  2 more Huntingdons have gone
along the S.E. side of Parker's
8841
Piece; replaced by new limes.
  Other elms, especially Uc,
are flowering rather sparsely;
the greast elms on Melford Green
very sparsely.

  Snow still lying on the Gog-magog
Hills and eastward: from Clare
onwards in all places except
where directly exposed to the sun.
About 4" fell at Waldingfield,
half of which is still there.
  All streams and ditches and the
R. Stour are very full. The main
road flooded in Stoke-by-Clare

disfigured by cutting off dead bran-
ches.
  Exotic trees include some
fine Eucalyptuses by the lake, up
to c. 50 ft high and 1 1/2 ft thick,
seemingly unaffected by frost.
Grounds are mown grass, rela-
tively unimproved, with Erophila etc.
8843
