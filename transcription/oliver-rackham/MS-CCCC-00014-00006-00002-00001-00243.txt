GREAT WADINGFIELD
1 January.
   The rose in the front is
flowering well.
The old decayed fence along
the front garden was taken down.
2 January.
  The Ransons are troubled with
a rat in the roof, which it is
feared may eat the electric
wiring - during the building ex-
tension a cable was found with
both cores exposed by the P.V.C.
insulation being eaten away.
The animal picks out bits of
oatmeal bait to eat, leaving
the ratsbane mixed therewith 
untouched.
3 January.
At 9.53 a.m. I was being
taken to Sudbury when there was
[18798-18799]
8798
a remarkable storm blowing up
from the north.  An intense black
cloud with white lightning at
frequent intervals and loud
thunder - but the latter was
soon difficult to hear for the
wind. Sudden heavy fall of snow
turning to hail, lying and
driving against vertical surfaces.
Although the weather has been
warm a layer of wet ice soon
formed on roads. The hail
was driven horizontally by a
steady wind, prob. force 8.
I have never seen such a com-
bination of wind and hail, nor
such a squall.  It lasted about
10 min.
Hail lay on the ground
all the way to Bury and Cam-
8799
bridge and remained most of 
the day.
  Between Cockfield and Greast
Bradfield an ash tree had
been snapt off and a lime blown
over the road. Wind from NNW.
  At Newmarket the squall
had been more severe. By the
station I noticed that the two
great chimneystacks of the Coron-
ation Hotel had been blown 
down, partly through the roof,
and most of the peg-tiles blown
away.  Many other roofs, par-
ticularly of cement tiles, dam-
aged. Some station fittings
wrecked. It was said that
in the signasl-box, which was
shifted on its plinth, the clock
stopped st 9.23. (15 miles
[18800-18801]
8800
from Sudbury). No trees seen
blown down.
  No damage observed in
Cambridge.
4 Jan.      [DIAG]
  Two greast elms (Uh, rather
like Huntingdon) somewhat
affected by DED  at King's 
School have been felled.
6 Jan.
  Severe frost in  the earlly
night - puddles frozen hard by
10 p.m. Later came cloudy
and thawed.
10 Jan.
  W. Palmer's "potter's wheel"
Christmas Rose is flowering well.
  The Garrya at Elm Green
Bradfied is close to flowering
very well.
8801
  The Kentwell Avenue seems 
to be unaffected.
11 Jan.
  The mildest day for many
years.
  Heavy rain all morning,
turning to snow in the afternoon.
The wind got upp, by 5 p.m.
it was too strong to cycle against
in the dark. Almost due N.,
very gusty. Snow turned to
rain, and then ceased. The
snow ay about 1 in. thick
and then slowly melted. Wind
reached its height about 5.30
and then irregularly moderated.
  The following trees blew down
at Leckhampton:
One large & 2 small cherry-
-plums in the lane
[18802-18803]
8802
Great deodar S.W. of the
croquet-lawn: uprooted
Arbutus by the deodar -
multistemmed, split asunder.
Pinus griffithii beyond the
deodar - uprooted.
 Atlantic cedar by the swim-
ming-pool - uprooted into pool.
  A great deal of deadwood
has come down, more than in
earlier storms (which did not
fell any trees).
12 Jan.
Botanic Garden,
Large branch (c. 1 1/2 ft dia.) split
from base of horsechestnut by
gale: included pocket of bark.
Another horsechestnut lost a
similar limb in an earier gale
for the same reason.
8803
  Weeping Larch: this was a
grafted tree c. 1 ft dia. The
trunk snapt off about 3 ft above
the graft and proved to be
wholly rotten, the inside powdery,
with a shell of about 1/2 in. of 
sound wood.
  Middlesized branch broken 
from top of big poplar near
lake.
  Buildings unaffected.
  Hawthorn with Russian Vine
collapsed.
  Several smallish conifers in
The Spinney partly uprooted.
  Cedars undamaged.

An exceedingly cold brilliant
day with snow lying all day.
Some further falls. Total about
1 1/2 in. thick.
