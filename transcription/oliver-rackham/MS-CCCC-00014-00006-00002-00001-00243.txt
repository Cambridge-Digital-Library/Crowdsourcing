GREAT WADINGFIELD
1 January.
   The rose in the front is
flowering well.
The old decayed fence along
the front garden was taken down.
2 January.
  The Ransons are troubled with
a rat in the roof, which it is
feared may eat the electric
wiring - during the building ex-
tension a cable was found with
both cores exposed by the P.V.C.
insulation being eaten away.
The animal picks out bits of
oatmeal bait to eat, leaving
the ratsbane mixed therewith 
untouched.
3 January.
At 9.53 a.m. I was being
taken to Sudbury when there was
[18798-18799]
8798
a remarkable storm blowing up
from the north.  An intense black
cloud with white lightning at
frequent intervals and loud
thunder - but the latter was
soon difficult to hear for the
wind. Sudden heavy fall of snow
turning to hail, lying and
driving against vertical surfaces.
Although the weather has been
warm a layer of wet ice soon
formed on roads. The hail
was driven horizontally by a
steady wind, prob. force 8.
I have never seen such a com-
bination of wind and hail, nor
such a squall.  It lasted about
10 min.
Hail lay on the ground
all the way to Bury and Cam-
8799
bridge and remained most of 
the day.
  Between Cockfield and Greast
Bradfield an ash tree had
been snapt off and a lime blown
over the road. Wind from NNW.
  At Newmarket the squall
had been more severe. By the
station I noticed that the two
great chimneystacks of the Coron-
ation Hotel had been blown 
down, partly through the roof,
and most of the peg-tiles blown
away.  Many other roofs, par-
ticularly of cement tiles, dam-
aged. Some station fittings
wrecked. It was said that
in the signasl-box, which was
shifted on its plinth, the clock
stopped st 9.23. (15 miles
[18800-18801]
8800
from Sudbury). No trees seen
blown down.
  No damage observed in
Cambridge.
4 Jan.      [DIAG]
  Two greast elms (Uh, rather
like Huntingdon) somewhat
affected by DED  at King's 
School have been felled.
6 Jan.
  Severe frost in  the earlly
night - puddles frozen hard by
10 p.m. Later came cloudy
and thawed.
10 Jan.
  W. Palmer's "potter's wheel"
Christmas Rose is flowering well.
  The Garrya at Elm Green
Bradfied is close to flowering
very well.
8801
  The Kentwell Avenue seems 
to be unaffected.
11 Jan.
  The mildest day for many
years.
  Heavy rain all morning,
turning to snow in the afternoon.
The wind got upp, by 5 p.m.
it was too strong to cycle against
in the dark. Almost due N.,
very gusty. Snow turned to
rain, and then ceased. The
snow ay about 1 in. thick
and then slowly melted. Wind
reached its height about 5.30
and then irregularly moderated.
  The following trees blew down
at Leckhampton:
One large & 2 small cherry-
-plums in the lane
[18802-18803]
8802
Great deodar S.W. of the
croquet-lawn: uprooted
Arbutus by the deodar -
multistemmed, split asunder.
Pinus griffithii beyond the
deodar - uprooted.
 Atlantic cedar by the swim-
ming-pool - uprooted into pool.
  A great deal of deadwood
has come down, more than in
earlier storms (which did not
fell any trees).
12 Jan.
Botanic Garden,
Large branch (c. 1 1/2 ft dia.) split
from base of horsechestnut by
gale: included pocket of bark.
Another horsechestnut lost a
similar limb in an earier gale
for the same reason.
8803
  Weeping Larch: this was a
grafted tree c. 1 ft dia. The
trunk snapt off about 3 ft above
the graft and proved to be
wholly rotten, the inside powdery,
with a shell of about 1/2 in. of 
sound wood.
  Middlesized branch broken 
from top of big poplar near
lake.
  Buildings unaffected.
  Hawthorn with Russian Vine
collapsed.
  Several smallish conifers in
The Spinney partly uprooted.
  Cedars undamaged.

An exceedingly cold brilliant
day with snow lying all day.
Some further falls. Total about
1 1/2 in. thick.
[18804-18805]
8804
Jan. 13.
  Great beech fallen at the
Roman Catholic Church. About 
3 ft. diameter c. 80 ft high.
Forked at the base into two
trunks very close together, which
were partly united in the lower
5 ft but largely separated by a
fold of baRk with included roots.
They split apart compLetely in
the fall. Roots poorly devel-
oped, esp. in the northern half which
was covered by a concrete road.
Decay had begun at the
included bark and had spread
outwards; all the wood was
still present, but full of zone
lines. Inner roots were dead.
Completely squashed a car
and damaged another.
8805
[DIAG] 
Fell due S.

  Yesterday evening there
had been a slight thaw fol-
lowed by a clear night of very
severe frost. Black ice all
over pavements - more slippery
than I have ever known 
Cambridge.
  Leckhampton swimming-
pool frozen.
  Snow continued lying
today. 
  A middlesized Ulmus procera
[18806-18807]
8806
on Clare Piece has snapped
off about 10 ft above ground - this
is the second half of a narrow fork
half of which broke in the gales
a year ago.
8807
Jan. 14.
  Petersfield.
  2 limes uprooted. One from
N, the other from N.N.E.
To the S. of a big group of
limes.
  The trees grow in gravelly soil,
with at least 2 ft of successive
layers of brickbats, pottery &
clay. Only small roots have
penetrated below the made earth;
the big ones are all sauperficial
and have partly dragged & partly
broken. Ground very wet. Trunk
about 8 ft dia. Root mats 
about 8 ft dia.
  One tree has a strong root
mat where the roots have failed to
penetrate a layer of clinker 
about 1 ft down.
[18808-18809]
8808
  Nearby on a Victorian
house at the cornewf Mortimer
Road a large 4-flue chimney
stack has toppled and lies in
one piece against an [????]
roof.
[DIAG]
  Day of cold thaw, snow
rapidly diminishing.

gregations.

just above big branch. 2'9 dia
at base
A larger 14"
B 12"
C 18" - less distinct worm
channels few
Great root mat at junction of
C & D, where many roots have
flattened themselves against the
D [????], as against the bottom 
of a pot.
D 6" - no worm channels
R contains some short [????] brush
like system of many roots with 
brittle hairy dilated tips.

8811
Jan. 18.
  Heavy snowfall much of the
day, lying several inches thick.
Jan. 19.
  About 4 in. snow in the 
morning after a night of hard
frost. Snow extends all the way 
to London and to Wye in Kent.
  Houses differ markedly in
their roof-insulation: the better-
insulated roofs keep the snow, while
on about half the houses it has
melted already.
Petts Wood, Chislehurst. Mainly
birch.
Bourne Wood, Swanley. Much chest-
nut, recently coppiced.
Wood at Noah's Ark, Kemsing. Ano-
ther chestnut wood, coppiced.
[18812-18813]

20 Jan.   WYE COLLEGE
  The town of Wye has many
notable timber-framed buildings.
Much of it belongs to the College
and is used as students' rooms.
  Oantigh Park has some fine
but not ancient trees. The house
is a grest 20th-cewnt. mansion re-
placing a Palladian one consumed
in a great fire.
  The College has a magnificent
medieval barn by the church at
Brook.
  The steep scarp of the Downs is
much overgrown with ash and haw-
thorn; some grassland remains.
  Lanes in thia area have mixed
hedges.
Hoad's Woiod, Hothfield & Bethersden.
Almost entirely coniferized.
8813
The Forest, Pluckley & Bethersden.
Largely old conifers; perhaps never
a wood.
Ddsring Wood. Intact; much chest-
nut.
Snow persisted all day.
21 Jan.     [DIAG]
  Snow begins to thaw. Frost
was never particularly severe.
There was no skating.
22 Jan.
  Felling horsechestnut 21. A
difficult tree: had to be felled
along the length of the avenue,
which was managed with a rope.
Moderate-sized, with a low narrow
fork. No wetwood at any point,
nor any Phytophthora-type exud-
ation.
[18814-18815]

The pink rose halfway down
Leckhampton garden is still
in full flower, hardly touched 
by frost.
