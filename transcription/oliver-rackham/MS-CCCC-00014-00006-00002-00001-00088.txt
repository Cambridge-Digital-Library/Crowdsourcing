7125
Villa Marie Sérène
Garavan Menton
Avril 1965

Psoralea
bituminosa. An interesting
plant, abundant in disturbed
around and at the edge
of roads and tracks, not in
[????]osed communities.
Inula viscosa. A very abun-
dant shrub, on both
limestone and sandstone.
Mainly in disturbed ground,
rubbish heaps , &c., but
also on screes and natu-
ral rather open commu-
nities. Also occurs in the
[????]

Helichrysum saxatile. Abun-
dant in dry places, espe-
cially on limestone.

[7126-7127]
7126
Asparagus officinalis. Frequent
but not usualy in quan-
tity, in bushy places on
limestone. The young shoots
with small leaves resemble
Tamus.

Ruscus. Scarce.

Clematic viticifolia. Frequent
in scrub on limestone
and calcareous sandstone.

Thymus officinalis. Abundant
on dry banks and slopes
especially on calcareous
sandstone.

Silene italica. Scarce.

7127
Reseda phyteuma. Common
in disturbed ground, roadsides,
[????]ter flushes, &c.

Lavandula stoechas. A very
[????]king plant with the
[????] ending in big purple
[????]cts. It is a strict
[????]cifuge and rather
[????]mophilous. It is very
local in the Mentone
district, and scarce even
in the V[????].

Asplenium onopteris. The
commonest of the genus,
damp to rather dry
[????]ks mainly on sandstone.

Cotyledon umbilicus. Quite

[7128-7129]
7128
rare, mainly in shady damp
habitats.

Moricandia maritima. This 
plant is said not to occur
in France. It is abundant
at the Balzi Rossi to within
50 yards of the frontier.
Its habitat is waste growing
and gravelley cliffs by the
shore. It has colonized the
great earthen banks above 
the new motor-way from
the frontier to La Mortola
and forms extensive de[????]
stands. A very striking plant.

Fumaria capreolata Abundant
on roadsides and waste
ground.

7129
F[????]bella P.D. Sell. The most
abundant of the several
critical spp in ruderal
habitats.

Antirrhinum orontium. A
common weed in waste
and cultivated places.

Crithmum maritimum. locally
abundant in the few
remaining natural coastal 
habitats.

[????]tles. Scarce; Galactites
[????]pidus is the commonest.

Gladiolus segetum. This
[????] plant is abundant
[????] grassy places near

[7130-7131]
7130
buildings at Grimaldi and
La Mortola, but was not seen
in France.

Euphorbia spp. Herbaceous
spp are many and some-
times difficult E. chara[????]
is characteristic of road-
sides, cultivated land, and 
garrigue at low altitude
near buildings. There are
two shrubs:

E. dendroids. Abundant
in limestone garrigue is
sheltered site at low
altitudes. A large soft
-wooded shrub, to 6 ft.
high. Forms fine stands
above Garavan and on

7131
[????]ao Martin, where it is dom-
inant.
E. spinosa. Very abundant
[????] limestone garrigue, with
[????] tendency to windswept
[????]es, reaching 1400 m.
[????]small tough intricate
[????]rub, to 1 1.2 ft high in 
[????]ourable situations. Not
[????]all soiny, but often
[????]many dead branches.

Eryngium campestre. Rare
[????] mainly inland.

Equisetum ramosissimum.
Abundant, corresponding
[????]logically to E. arvense
Britain.

[7132-7133]
7132
Cotinus coggygria. Frequent
in suitable places in lime-
stone. In the cooler places
and mainly inland.

Cornus mas. Once seen (p[????]

Fraxinus ornus. Not seen.

Crataegus monogyna. In
mountains.

Viburnum lantana. In
mountains.

Daphne mezereum. Frequent
in the mountains.

Sedum dasyphyllum. In
mountains.

7133
Further notes of particular
days.

April 5. Mentone.
Araucaria excelsa is
occasionally grown in Gara-
[????]n. A very tall tree with
a beautiful regular habit
[????]whorled branches and
stout erect needles.
[????]Bougainvillaea spectabilis
grows against S. facing
walls. A large intricate
shrub, dying in the more
exposed places, just about 
to come into flower.
Oranges, lemons, grape-
fruit, pummeloes, and other
citrus spp are grown on
the terraces of Casa Rossa.

[7134-7135]
7134
The fruiting season is
nearly over, though some
tangerines were eaten off the
tree (tasting quite different).
They do not flourish, the
site being too dry. Most
trees are affected with the
"scaly bark disease" (Fred
Wicker). A slow die-back
gradually spreads along
the main branches on
the trunk, usually from
a snag. The bark of the
affected areas peels off to
reveal the blackened mu-
scular tissue. It is said to 
be fatal unless the part 
affected is cut off.
E. of the Casa Rossa
is the famous and beau-

7135
tiful olive grove Le Pian,
Strasburger p. 339. This is
on a gentle S. facing
slope, and contains about
500 trees planted in
single rows on terraces.
The trees appear to be
even-aged, and are said
to be about 500 years
old. The trunks are
usually about 2 1/2 ft diam.,
with many projecting
[????]sses, usually branching
about 8-10 ft from the 
[????]nd. All the trees are
[????] vigorous health. The
[????]ce belongs to the
[????]poration and is a public
[????]rk. The olives have
[????]ot been gathered.

[7136-7137]
7136
Along the W. is a steeo
slope overlooking the road
which leads up to Casa Rossa.
This is liable to landslides
caused by springs. It has
several calcifuge spp
such as Cistus salviifoli
April 6. Mentone-Castellar
On each and every
cultivated tree in Casa
Rossa and many other
gardens in Mentone is
nailed a small paper
bag labelled Sirop d'Arsenic
with a warning about
its poisonous nature. This
is part of the lutte cont[????]
la fourmi d'Argentine, about
which one sees old and
tattered posters in public.

7137
places. The Argentinian
ant is said to be a 
very small sp. which lives 
in walls and buildings. 
It eats everything. It 
has given a lot of trouble
to Mentone since its intro-
duction. It is by no 
means confined to dilapida-
ted buildings: in some
[????] blocks of flats, the
inhabitants keep the legs
in their beds standing in
water. The Syrup of Arsenic
is topped up from time 
to time by a man paid 
to do this job. The ants
[????] supposed to climb
[????] the tree, drink, and die.
There is a case in the

[7138-7139]
7138
Newspapers of a woman
suing a local authority
because her child had been
poisoned by eating syrup of
arsenic put out for the
ants in a public park.
Some very small ants 
were seen in immense num-
bers consuming a worm
on the way to Castellar.
Daphne gnidium is
very characteristic of
exposed limestone savannah.
It is a globular bush
which makes very good
growth (c. 2 ft) in the first
year, many soft shoots
coming up from the bad
growth rapidly decline
in subsequent years and

7139
the final height of the
bush is about 3 ft. It is
possible to show that the
last fire in the area
S.E. of Plan du Lion was
years ago, the separate
seasons' growth on Daphne
[????]idium being quite distinct.
No sign of flower or frs.
There is a splendid
patch of Iris italica along
the (unmarked) border,
just on the Italian side,
at or just above the Buisse
St Paul. Large and very
beautiful purple fls. On
limestone pavement, mainly
bare or covered with
large matted tufts of a 
sterile file-leaved Brachy-

[7140-7141]
7140
podium.
Corunilla valentina is a
superb species on the W.
facing cliffs of the Cima
de la Giralda. Very abund-
andt in a small area; it
is said to be found in a
few other places in the dis-
trict, to which it is endemic.

April 7. Cap Martin & Roquebrune.
Much of the original
vegetation of Cap Martin
survives in the grounds of
the villas, many of which
are quite uncultivated. A
path runs round the
headland through these
grounds; it is enclosed
by high wire-netting fences

7141
with semi-natural vegeta-
tion on either side. Such
parts of the coast as are
accessible to the public
are defiled with rubbish
and builders' rubble.
The vegetation on
the rocky limestone
ground on the slopes
above the sea is a 
rather luxuriant garrigue
with fine strands of Euphor-
bia dendroides. Several of
the commoner shrubs
here, such as the curious
Cneorum, Anthyllis barba-
-jovis, and Cistus linifolius,
are rare or absent inland.
The flora is enriched
by several naturalized

[7142-7143]
7142
spp such as the large
laurel - or Hebe-like shrub
Pittosporum tobieri.
The limestone pavement
along the shore is
quite barren of higher plants in
the spray zone, but
higher up there is a
characteristic zone of
Phagnalon saxatile and
Limonium "bellidifolium" in
the crevices. There is
then a zone of dwarf
Pinus halepensis, and
finally the coastal garrigue.
Mrs Warr's garden,
in lower Roccabruna, like
many of these gardens,
was made out of
completely uncultivated

7143
limestone pavement about 
1890. It now contains
large trees. It is rather
sensitive to drought.
Many plants are
flowering by the sea which
are still in bud in the
hills. These include
spartium and Calycotome.
[!!!!]A[!!!!]
April 8. Gorbio & Sant'Agnese.
Gorbio has ruderal
habitats in ruins and
cultivated ground with
such annuals as Urtica
membranacea, Veronica
cymbalaria, Arabis hirsuta,
thelygonium cynocrambe,
&c.
The way to Sant'Agnese

[7144-7145]
7144
goes through rather
well-watered scrub, with
open grassy glades. Bellis
sylvestris is here the ecolo-
gical equivalent of B.
perennis.
Further on, under
the crags of the Cime
de Biancon, there is rocky
ground with big detached
rocks. This is a country
of Arundo thickets, with
various shrubs on the
rocks: Juniperus phoenicea,
Sorbus chamaemespilus,
Cotoneaster, Pyrus communis,
&c. Further to the E. it
becomes drier and resembles
typical garrigue.
The Pescaire valley is

7145
mainly grassland (with a
few fruit trees) on terraces.
This is maintained and
used for mowing and
cattle by the people of
Sant'Agnese.
On Ophrys atrata, see
p. 7112.
The Cima de Sant'Ag-
nese is a jagged lime-
stone peak with a ridge
running N. and S. An
impassable brèche cuts 
across the ridge just
N. of the castle ruins.
On the W. side (very
accessible from the town)
is somewhat grassy
garrigue with frequent
bushes of Juniperus

[7146-7147]
7146
phoenicea, many of which
are in accessible pla-
ces. On the top, in the
castle ruins, is a fine
group of planted Cupressus
sempervirens, doing
enexpectedly well in
such a windswept place.
In the brèche, the cliffs
are covered with bushes,
and Juniperus phoenicea
is abundant.
On the E. side of this
peak, the ground is very
steep, though without
any very high precipices.
The vegetation is a
windswept garrigue with
few tall evergreens. Cotinus
is abundant.

7147
April 9. Provence.
The habitat for Mar-
silea at Vidauban is
shallow roadside ditches
by vineyards on siliceous
soil. Water is not at
present standing in 
them.
In the Bois de Roquan,
true maquis with a
closed community of
shrubs is confined to
areas near water flushes.
The species listed on
p. 7023 form a rather
disturbed community near
the road. A small
area of very fine maquis
(spp on p. 7024-5) with
a dense and tall shrub

[7148-7149]
7148
layer occurs just over the
old bridge.
The wet hollows are
of various types. The Iso-
etidetum was seen
several times, though
only once with Ophioglossum
lusitanicum. Iris italica
forms large and small
patches in more gravelley
wet hollows and in
places where there is a
definite stream. The
purple and yellow clones
often occur together. The
Ranunculus revellieri
habitat was a very wet
example of this kind.
The Replis-Bulliardia commu-
nity requires some depth

7149
of standing water. See pp
7037-8.
Pinus pinea sets seed
and germinates on the
sandstone, but young
trees above 5 years old or
so are rare. They must
be very vulnerable to fire.
The seedling in its first
few years has very
glaucous leaves; the adult
leaves appear suddenly.
Quercus suber occurs
in the area as occasional
stunted trees; a few are
large enough to cut for
cork.
Except for the small
stretch of the Étangs de

[7150-7151]
7150
Villepey, almost the
entire coast from St Tropez
to Garavan is built up.
April 10. Foret de Menton.
A gecko was found
at the Casa Rossa. A 
newt-like creature about
3 in. long, gray, rather
delicate. The suckers on
its fingers and toes were
inconspicuous.

April 11. Mentone, La Turbia.
Palms for Palm Sun-
day are locally made (for-
merly imported from N. Africa,
but not longer, for political
reasons). They are
usually bright yellow
edged with green; this is

7151
said to be achieved by
artifically tying up the
young leaves so that they
become etiolated. They
are platted into elaborate
shapes and sold in the
market.

April 11. La Colle.
This was the only day
on which it rained, and
then only for an hour or
so.

April 13. La Mòrtola, Ventimiglia.
The little cove just W. of 
the Hanbury Gardens is
the first relatively un-
disturbed coast since St
Tropez. The rocks are

[7152-7153]
7152
very variedl a wide
seam of very friable (and
dangerous) schist crops out
on the E. side.
On limestone pavement
just submerged (the tide
is quite imperceptible_ in
this cove is a wonderful
flora of algae, including
Padina pavonia, which
forms characteristics rather
tough sectors about 2 in.
across, coloured in zones
of browns, khakies, and
dull greens.
In the Hanbury Gardens
is a mighty Banksian
rose now flowering. It 
forms a great thicket
some 15 ft high, far

7153
surpassing the old fig tree
whereon it was originally
trained, and flowering
vigorously all over.
Vegetation at Venti-
miglia is rather poor. The 
lower course of the Roja
is a stinking ditch, while
the extensive gravels of the
Nervia are a rubbish dump.
Both these rivers are
low at present; indeed, 
the Nervia loses itself in
a shingle ridge and
was thereby crossed
dry-shod. Floods are
probably infrequent, and
the gravels are very
overgrown. The sea front
of Ventimiglia is built

[7154-7155]
7154
up with huts and there is
little waste ground.

April 14. Limone.
In the gorges of the
Roya around Saorge and 
Fontàn is a wet limestone
flora with Mediterranean
elements. Pinguicula lusi-
tanica is very striking
by the roadside in one place;
fls large, brilliant mauve,
with a white eye. Ballota
spinosa is a curious goose-
berry-like shrub said to
be endemic to this valley.
Lizards and a slow-
-worm were found in
the meadows near vié-
vola.

7155
The meadows on 
steep slopes between Limone
and the Colle di Tenda are
very rich in spring flowers;
they open in zones which
follow the melting snow
uphill. Much snow
still lies around the
top of the pass and down
to about 1300 m. on the
N. side. Leucojum is
very abundant, apparently
only in this small area.
Corydalis solida is also
abundant. Gagea and
Crocus are less frequent.
Anemone ranunculoides
and others are later
and much flowering
round the town of Limone

[7156-7157]
7156
(where the season comes
much later than at
corresponding altitudes on
the S. side)
Spruce forms a
rather narrow and broken
altitudinal zone in the
central Alpes Maritimes,
which are a narrow strip
of siliceous rock.
At La Visitation, just
below the railway station
of Viévola, there are some
very fine mowing-meadows
with abundant Narcissus
(no longer flowering)
and much Petasites.
A Bonelli's eagle was
seen at [!!!!]Tec[!!!!] La Giandola
gliding slowly at a great

7151
height over the mountains.
April 15. Sospello-Mentone.
A Paeonia (not yet flow-
ering) is very abundant
in a small area facing
N.E. on the Italian side
of the Colle Treitore and
Bricco Treitore, under light
shade.
Pinus sylvestris is the
dominant in forests over
900 m. in the Grammonte
district, and reaches almost
to the top of the E. summit
of the Grammonte (1380 m.)
The trees at the higher
altitudes are scattered
and stunted.
The top of the Grammonte
is a limestone pavement

[7158-7159]
7158
with projecting exposed
rocks and a scanty
cover of Euphorbia spinosa
and other cushion-like
plants. This continues
down the slope on the S.
side, which is very rocky
and goes to scree in places.
The cliffs and screes
of the Pas de Strafourche are
similar to those on the lower
slopes of the Roc d'Orméà above
Castellaro.
Between the Strafourche
and Castellaro is an
area of old terraces, partly
grazed, but mostly with
open savannah dominated
by Pinus mantima. The
latter varies in density. A

7159
recent fire shows how
the wide spacing of most
of the savannah forest is
acheived; the more isolated
trees have survived, but
where the trees are denser
the fire has locally got into
the crowns and thinned
them out. The smaller
trees, especially where sup-
pressed, are more vulnerable
them the larger. It is
nowhere clear how these
forests regenerate; possibly
they are of recent origin
and are a successional 
stage.

Ruta graveolens. This and
related spp are fairly frequent

[7160-7161]
7160
in dry places and by way-
sides, usually only a few
plants together. The plant
has very remarkable glan-
dular fls; the smell and
taste are strong and aro-
matic, with a strong tinge
of sulphur compounds, and
most people dislike them 
intensely.
