of roads and tracks, not in
[????]osed communities.
Inula viscosa. A very abun-
dant shrub, on both
limestone and sandstone.
Mainly in disturbed ground,
rubbish heaps , &c., but
also on screes and natu-
ral rather open commu-
nities. Also occurs in the
[????]

Helichrysum saxatile. Abun-
dant in dry places, espe-
cially on limestone.

[7126-7127]
7126
Asparagus officinalis. Frequent
but not usualy in quan-
tity, in bushy places on
limestone. The young shoots
with small leaves resemble
Tamus.

Ruscus. Scarce.

Clematic viticifolia. Frequent
in scrub on limestone
and calcareous sandstone.

Thymus officinalis. Abundant
on dry banks and slopes
especially on calcareous
sandstone.

Silene italica. Scarce.

7127
Reseda phyteuma. Common
in disturbed ground, roadsides,
[????]ter flushes, &c.

Lavandula stoechas. A very
[????]king plant with the

commonest of the genus,
damp to rather dry
[????]ks mainly on sandstone.

Cotyledon umbilicus. Quite

[7128-7129]
7128
rare, mainly in shady damp
habitats.

Moricandia maritima. This 
plant is said not to occur
in France. It is abundant
at the Balzi Rossi to within
50 yards of the frontier.
Its habitat is waste growing
and gravelley cliffs by the
shore. It has colonized the
great earthen banks above 
the new motor-way from
the frontier to La Mortola
and forms extensive de[????]
stands. A very striking plant.

Fumaria capreolata Abundant
on roadsides and waste
ground.

7129
F[????]bella P.D. Sell. The most
abundant of the several
critical spp in ruderal
habitats.

Antirrhinum orontium. A
common weed in waste

[????] grassy places near

[7130-7131]

Euphorbia spp. Herbaceous
spp are many and some-
times difficult E. chara[????]
is characteristic of road-
sides, cultivated land, and 
garrigue at low altitude
near buildings. There are
two shrubs:

E. dendroids. Abundant
in limestone garrigue is
sheltered site at low
altitudes. A large soft
-wooded shrub, to 6 ft.
high. Forms fine stands
above Garavan and on

7131
[????]ao Martin, where it is dom-
inant.
E. spinosa. Very abundant
[????] limestone garrigue, with
[????] tendency to windswept
[????]es, reaching 1400 m.
[????]small tough intricate
[????]rub, to 1 1.2 ft high in 
[????]ourable situations. Not
[????]all soiny, but often
[????]many dead branches.

Eryngium campestre. Rare
[????] mainly inland.

Equisetum ramosissimum.
Abundant, corresponding
[????]logically to E. arvense
Britain.

[7132-7133]
7132

in suitable places in lime-
stone. In the cooler places
and mainly inland.

Further notes of particular
days.

April 5. Mentone.
Araucaria excelsa is
occasionally grown in Gara-
[????]n. A very tall tree with
a beautiful regular habit
[????]whorled branches and
stout erect needles.
[????]Bougainvillaea spectabilis
grows against S. facing
walls. A large intricate
shrub, dying in the more
exposed places, just about 
to come into flower.
Oranges, lemons, grape-
fruit, pummeloes, and other
citrus spp are grown on
the terraces of Casa Rossa.

[7134-7135]
7134
The fruiting season is
nearly over, though some
tangerines were eaten off the
tree (tasting quite different).
They do not flourish, the
site being too dry. Most
trees are affected with the
"scaly bark disease" (Fred
Wicker). A slow die-back
gradually spreads along
the main branches on
the trunk, usually from
a snag. The bark of the
affected areas peels off to
reveal the blackened mu-
scular tissue. It is said to 
be fatal unless the part 
affected is cut off.
E. of the Casa Rossa
is the famous and beau-

7135
tiful olive grove Le Pian,
Strasburger p. 339. This is
on a gentle S. facing
slope, and contains about
500 trees planted in
single rows on terraces.
The trees appear to be
even-aged, and are said
to be about 500 years
old. The trunks are
usually about 2 1/2 ft diam.,
with many projecting
[????]sses, usually branching
about 8-10 ft from the 
[????]nd. All the trees are
[????] vigorous health. The
[????]ce belongs to the
[????]poration and is a public
[????]rk. The olives have
[????]ot been gathered.
