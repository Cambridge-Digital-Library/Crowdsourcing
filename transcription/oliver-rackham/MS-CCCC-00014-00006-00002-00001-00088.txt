7125
Villa Marie Sérène
Garavan Menton
Avril 1965

Psoralea
bituminosa. An interesting
plant, abundant in disturbed
around and at the edge
of roads and tracks, not in
[????]osed communities.
Inula viscosa. A very abun-
dant shrub, on both
limestone and sandstone.
Mainly in disturbed ground,
rubbish heaps , &c., but
also on screes and natu-
ral rather open commu-
nities. Also occurs in the
[????]

Helichrysum saxatile. Abun-
dant in dry places, espe-
cially on limestone.

[7126-7127]
7126
Asparagus officinalis. Frequent
but not usualy in quan-
tity, in bushy places on
limestone. The young shoots
with small leaves resemble
Tamus.

Ruscus. Scarce.

Clematic viticifolia. Frequent
in scrub on limestone
and calcareous sandstone.

Thymus officinalis. Abundant
on dry banks and slopes
especially on calcareous
sandstone.

Silene italica. Scarce.

7127
Reseda phyteuma. Common
in disturbed ground, roadsides,
[????]ter flushes, &c.

Lavandula stoechas. A very
[????]king plant with the
[????] ending in big purple
[????]cts. It is a strict
[????]cifuge and rather
[????]mophilous. It is very
local in the Mentone
district, and scarce even
in the V[????].

Asplenium onopteris. The
commonest of the genus,
damp to rather dry
[????]ks mainly on sandstone.

Cotyledon umbilicus. Quite

[7128-7129]
7128
rare, mainly in shady damp
habitats.

Moricandia maritima. This 
plant is said not to occur
in France. It is abundant
at the Balzi Rossi to within
50 yards of the frontier.
Its habitat is waste growing
and gravelley cliffs by the
shore. It has colonized the
great earthen banks above 
the new motor-way from
the frontier to La Mortola
and forms extensive de[????]
stands. A very striking plant.

Fumaria capreolata Abundant
on roadsides and waste
ground.

7129
F[????]bella P.D. Sell. The most
abundant of the several
critical spp in ruderal
habitats.

Antirrhinum orontium. A
common weed in waste
and cultivated places.

Crithmum maritimum. locally
abundant in the few
remaining natural coastal 
habitats.

[????]tles. Scarce; Galactites
[????]pidus is the commonest.

Gladiolus segetum. This
[????] plant is abundant
[????] grassy places near

[7130-7131]
7130
buildings at Grimaldi and
La Mortola, but was not seen
in France.

Euphorbia spp. Herbaceous
spp are many and some-
times difficult E. chara[????]
is characteristic of road-
sides, cultivated land, and 
garrigue at low altitude
near buildings. There are
two shrubs:

E. dendroids. Abundant
in limestone garrigue is
sheltered site at low
altitudes. A large soft
-wooded shrub, to 6 ft.
high. Forms fine stands
above Garavan and on

7131
[????]ao Martin, where it is dom-
inant.
E. spinosa. Very abundant
[????] limestone garrigue, with
[????] tendency to windswept
[????]es, reaching 1400 m.
[????]small tough intricate
[????]rub, to 1 1.2 ft high in 
[????]ourable situations. Not
[????]all soiny, but often
[????]many dead branches.

Eryngium campestre. Rare
[????] mainly inland.

Equisetum ramosissimum.
Abundant, corresponding
[????]logically to E. arvense
Britain.

[7132-7133]
7132
Cotinus coggygria. Frequent
in suitable places in lime-
stone. In the cooler places
and mainly inland.

Cornus mas. Once seen (p[????]

Fraxinus ornus. Not seen.

Crataegus monogyna. In
mountains.

Viburnum lantana. In
mountains.

Daphne mezereum. Frequent
in the mountains.

Sedum dasyphyllum. In
mountains.

7133
Further notes of particular
days.

April 5. Mentone.
Araucaria excelsa is
occasionally grown in Gara-
[????]n. A very tall tree with
a beautiful regular habit
[????]whorled branches and
stout erect needles.
[????]Bougainvillaea spectabilis
grows against S. facing
walls. A large intricate
shrub, dying in the more
exposed places, just about 
to come into flower.
Oranges, lemons, grape-
fruit, pummeloes, and other
citrus spp are grown on
the terraces of Casa Rossa.

[7134-7135]
7134
The fruiting season is
nearly over, though some
tangerines were eaten off the
tree (tasting quite different).
They do not flourish, the
site being too dry. Most
trees are affected with the
"scaly bark disease" (Fred
Wicker). A slow die-back
gradually spreads along
the main branches on
the trunk, usually from
a snag. The bark of the
affected areas peels off to
reveal the blackened mu-
scular tissue. It is said to 
be fatal unless the part 
affected is cut off.
E. of the Casa Rossa
is the famous and beau-

7135
tiful olive grove Le Pian,
Strasburger p. 339. This is
on a gentle S. facing
slope, and contains about
500 trees planted in
single rows on terraces.
The trees appear to be
even-aged, and are said
to be about 500 years
old. The trunks are
usually about 2 1/2 ft diam.,
with many projecting
[????]sses, usually branching
about 8-10 ft from the 
[????]nd. All the trees are
[????] vigorous health. The
[????]ce belongs to the
[????]poration and is a public
[????]rk. The olives have
[????]ot been gathered.

[7136-7137]
7136
Along the W. is a steeo
slope overlooking the road
which leads up to Casa Rossa.
This is liable to landslides
caused by springs. It has
several calcifuge spp
such as Cistus salviifoli
April 6. Mentone-Castellar
On each and every
cultivated tree in Casa
Rossa and many other
gardens in Mentone is
nailed a small paper
bag labelled Sirop d'Arsenic
with a warning about
its poisonous nature. This
is part of the lutte cont[????]
la fourmi d'Argentine, about
which one sees old and
tattered posters in public.

7137
places. The Argentinian
ant is said to be a 
very small sp. which lives 
in walls and buildings. 
It eats everything. It 
has given a lot of trouble
to Mentone since its intro-
duction. It is by no 
means confined to dilapida-
ted buildings: in some
[????] blocks of flats, the
inhabitants keep the legs
in their beds standing in
water. The Syrup of Arsenic
is topped up from time 
to time by a man paid 
to do this job. The ants
[????] supposed to climb
[????] the tree, drink, and die.
There is a case in the

[7138-7139]
7138
Newspapers of a woman
suing a local authority
because her child had been
poisoned by eating syrup of
arsenic put out for the
ants in a public park.
Some very small ants 
were seen in immense num-
bers consuming a worm
on the way to Castellar.
Daphne gnidium is
very characteristic of
exposed limestone savannah.
It is a globular bush
which makes very good
growth (c. 2 ft) in the first
year, many soft shoots
coming up from the bad
growth rapidly decline
in subsequent years and

7139
the final height of the
bush is about 3 ft. It is
possible to show that the
last fire in the area
S.E. of Plan du Lion was
years ago, the separate
seasons' growth on Daphne
[????]idium being quite distinct.
No sign of flower or frs.
There is a splendid
patch of Iris italica along
the (unmarked) border,
just on the Italian side,
at or just above the Buisse
St Paul. Large and very
beautiful purple fls. On
limestone pavement, mainly
bare or covered with
large matted tufts of a 
sterile file-leaved Brachy-

[7140-7141]
7140
podium.
Corunilla valentina is a
superb species on the W.
facing cliffs of the Cima
de la Giralda. Very abund-
andt in a small area; it
is said to be found in a
few other places in the dis-
trict, to which it is endemic.

April 7. Cap Martin & Roquebrune.
Much of the original
vegetation of Cap Martin
survives in the grounds of
the villas, many of which
are quite uncultivated. A
path runs round the
headland through these
grounds; it is enclosed
by high wire-netting fences

7141
with semi-natural vegeta-
tion on either side. Such
parts of the coast as are
accessible to the public
are defiled with rubbish
and builders' rubble.
The vegetation on
the rocky limestone
ground on the slopes
above the sea is a 
rather luxuriant garrigue
with fine strands of Euphor-
bia dendroides. Several of
the commoner shrubs
here, such as the curious
Cneorum, Anthyllis barba-
-jovis, and Cistus linifolius,
are rare or absent inland.
The flora is enriched
by several naturalized

[7142-7143]
7142
spp such as the large
laurel - or Hebe-like shrub
Pittosporum tobieri.
The limestone pavement
along the shore is
quite barren of higher plants in
the spray zone, but
higher up there is a
characteristic zone of
Phagnalon saxatile and
Limonium "bellidifolium" in
the crevices. There is
then a zone of dwarf
Pinus halepensis, and
finally the coastal garrigue.
Mrs Warr's garden,
in lower Roccabruna, like
many of these gardens,
was made out of
completely uncultivated

7143
limestone pavement about 
1890. It now contains
large trees. It is rather
sensitive to drought.
Many plants are
flowering by the sea which
are still in bud in the
hills. These include
spartium and Calycotome.
[!!!!]A[!!!!]
April 8. Gorbio & Sant'Agnese.
Gorbio has ruderal
habitats in ruins and
cultivated ground with
such annuals as Urtica
membranacea, Veronica
cymbalaria, Arabis hirsuta,
thelygonium cynocrambe,
&c.
The way to Sant'Agnese

[7144-7145]
7144
goes through rather
well-watered scrub, with
open grassy glades. Bellis
sylvestris is here the ecolo-
gical equivalent of B.
perennis.
Further on, under
the crags of the Cime
de Biancon, there is rocky
ground with big detached
rocks. This is a country
of Arundo thickets, with
various shrubs on the
rocks: Juniperus phoenicea,
Sorbus chamaemespilus,
Cotoneaster, Pyrus communis,
&c. Further to the E. it
becomes drier and resembles
typical garrigue.
The Pescaire valley is

7145
mainly grassland (with a
few fruit trees) on terraces.
This is maintained and
used for mowing and
cattle by the people of
Sant'Agnese.
On Ophrys atrata, see
p. 7112.
The Cima de Sant'Ag-
nese is a jagged lime-
stone peak with a ridge
running N. and S. An
impassable brèche cuts 
across the ridge just
N. of the castle ruins.
On the W. side (very
accessible from the town)
is somewhat grassy
garrigue with frequent
bushes of Juniperus

[7146-7147]
7146
phoenicea, many of which
are in accessible pla-
ces. On the top, in the
castle ruins, is a fine
group of planted Cupressus
sempervirens, doing
enexpectedly well in
such a windswept place.
In the brèche, the cliffs
are covered with bushes,
and Juniperus phoenicea
is abundant.
On the E. side of this
peak, the ground is very
steep, though without
any very high precipices.
The vegetation is a
windswept garrigue with
few tall evergreens. Cotinus
is abundant.

7147
April 9. Provence.
The habitat for Mar-
silea at Vidauban is
shallow roadside ditches
by vineyards on siliceous
soil. Water is not at
present standing in 
them.
In the Bois de Roquan,
true maquis with a
closed community of
shrubs is confined to
areas near water flushes.
The species listed on
p. 7023 form a rather
disturbed community near
the road. A small
area of very fine maquis
(spp on p. 7024-5) with
a dense and tall shrub

[7148-7149]
7148
layer occurs just over the
old bridge.
The wet hollows are
of various types. The Iso-
etidetum was seen
several times, though
only once with Ophioglossum
lusitanicum. Iris italica
forms large and small
patches in more gravelley
wet hollows and in
places where there is a
definite stream. The
purple and yellow clones
often occur together. The
Ranunculus revellieri
habitat was a very wet
example of this kind.
The Replis-Bulliardia commu-
nity requires some depth

7149
of standing water. See pp
7037-8.
Pinus pinea sets seed
and germinates on the
sandstone, but young
trees above 5 years old or
so are rare. They must
be very vulnerable to fire.
The seedling in its first
few years has very
glaucous leaves; the adult
leaves appear suddenly.
Quercus suber occurs
in the area as occasional
stunted trees; a few are
large enough to cut for
cork.
Except for the small
stretch of the Étangs de

[7150-7151]
7150
Villepey, almost the
entire coast from St Tropez
to Garavan is built up.
April 10. Foret de Menton.
A gecko was found
at the Casa Rossa. A 
newt-like creature about
3 in. long, gray, rather
delicate. The suckers on
its fingers and toes were
inconspicuous.

April 11. Mentone, La Turbia.
Palms for Palm Sun-
day are locally made (for-
merly imported from N. Africa,
but not longer, for political
reasons). They are
usually bright yellow
edged with green; this is

7151
said to be achieved by
artifically tying up the
young leaves so that they
become etiolated. They
are platted into elaborate
shapes and sold in the
market.

April 11. La Colle.
This was the only day
on which it rained, and
then only for an hour or
so.

April 13. La Mòrtola, Ventimiglia.
The little cove just W. of 
the Hanbury Gardens is
the first relatively un-
disturbed coast since St
Tropez. The rocks are

[7152-7153]
7152
very variedl a wide
seam of very friable (and
dangerous) schist crops out
on the E. side.
On limestone pavement
just submerged (the tide
is quite imperceptible_ in
this cove is a wonderful
flora of algae, including
Padina pavonia, which
forms characteristics rather
tough sectors about 2 in.
across, coloured in zones
of browns, khakies, and
dull greens.
In the Hanbury Gardens
is a mighty Banksian
rose now flowering. It 
forms a great thicket
some 15 ft high, far

7153
surpassing the old fig tree
whereon it was originally
trained, and flowering
vigorously all over.
Vegetation at Venti-
miglia is rather poor. The 
lower course of the Roja
is a stinking ditch, while
the extensive gravels of the
Nervia are a rubbish dump.
Both these rivers are
low at present; indeed, 
the Nervia loses itself in
a shingle ridge and
was thereby crossed
dry-shod. Floods are
probably infrequent, and
the gravels are very
overgrown. The sea front
of Ventimiglia is built

[7154-7155]
7154
up with huts and there is
little waste ground.

April 14. Limone.
In the gorges of the
Roya around Saorge and 
Fontàn is a wet limestone
flora with Mediterranean
elements. Pinguicula lusi-
tanica is very striking
by the roadside in one place;
fls large, brilliant mauve,
with a white eye. Ballota
spinosa is a curious goose-
berry-like shrub said to
be endemic to this valley.
Lizards and a slow-
-worm were found in
the meadows near vié-
vola.

7155
The meadows on 
steep slopes between Limone
and the Colle di Tenda are
very rich in spring flowers;
they open in zones which
follow the melting snow
uphill. Much snow
still lies around the
top of the pass and down
to about 1300 m. on the
N. side. Leucojum is
very abundant, apparently
only in this small area.
Corydalis solida is also
abundant. Gagea and
Crocus are less frequent.
Anemone ranunculoides
and others are later
and much flowering
round the town of Limone

[7156-7157]
7156
(where the season comes
much later than at
corresponding altitudes on
the S. side)
Spruce forms a
rather narrow and broken
altitudinal zone in the
central Alpes Maritimes,
which are a narrow strip
of siliceous rock.
At La Visitation, just
below the railway station
of Viévola, there are some
very fine mowing-meadows
with abundant Narcissus
(no longer flowering)
and much Petasites.
A Bonelli's eagle was
seen at [!!!!]Tec[!!!!] La Giandola
gliding slowly at a great

7151
height over the mountains.
April 15. Sospello-Mentone.
A Paeonia (not yet flow-
ering) is very abundant
in a small area facing
N.E. on the Italian side
of the Colle Treitore and
Bricco Treitore, under light
shade.
Pinus sylvestris is the
dominant in forests over
900 m. in the Grammonte
district, and reaches almost
to the top of the E. summit
of the Grammonte (1380 m.)
The trees at the higher
altitudes are scattered
and stunted.
The top of the Grammonte
is a limestone pavement

[7158-7159]
7158
with projecting exposed
rocks and a scanty
cover of Euphorbia spinosa
and other cushion-like
plants. This continues
down the slope on the S.
side, which is very rocky
and goes to scree in places.
The cliffs and screes
of the Pas de Strafourche are
similar to those on the lower
slopes of the Roc d'Orméà above
Castellaro.
Between the Strafourche
and Castellaro is an
area of old terraces, partly
grazed, but mostly with
open savannah dominated
by Pinus mantima. The
latter varies in density. A

7159
recent fire shows how
the wide spacing of most
of the savannah forest is
acheived; the more isolated
trees have survived, but
where the trees are denser
the fire has locally got into
the crowns and thinned
them out. The smaller
trees, especially where sup-
pressed, are more vulnerable
them the larger. It is
nowhere clear how these
forests regenerate; possibly
they are of recent origin
and are a successional 
stage.

Ruta graveolens. This and
related spp are fairly frequent

[7160-7161]
7160
in dry places and by way-
sides, usually only a few
plants together. The plant
has very remarkable glan-
dular fls; the smell and
taste are strong and aro-
matic, with a strong tinge
of sulphur compounds, and
most people dislike them 
intensely.

Toads. Very abundant indeed,
whatever there is water
or damp ground, in ravines,
springs, tanks, &c. Usually
heard rather than seen.
The noise is somewhat
like the carving of rooks,
but more gutteral. They
start about an hour be-

7161
fore sunset (thus well
before dusk, which comes
very abruptly after sunset)
and go on till past mid-
night. Where there are
many, they sing in unison,
like a football crowd, with
some irregularity but with
peaks of sound about
every 1'4 seconds. When
approached to within
five yards or so, they
stop, resuming a few
seconds after the intruder
has gone. They were
only once seen, on the
way down from Ste Agnès
to below Monti: large
long-legged brownish warty
amphibians, nearly sub-

[7162-7163]
7162
merged in an open over-
grown tank, in which position
they sang desultorily.
[!!!!]Frogs[!!!!] Toads were
heard in many places.
They are common in Garavan;
in one place in a garden
adjoining the main coast
road; very numerous in
the slightly damp ravine
which adjoins Le Pian
on the N.E.
April 17.
Mistletoe is extremely
conspicuous and abundant
on poplars between Paris
and Calais, the host trees
being at present leafless.
April 18.     [SYMBOL]
A duck is sitting on

[7164-7165]
7164
by Sheep's Green is still
alive, though almost buried
in litter.
April 24.
Buff Wood.
Unusually dry, with no
surface water. Some of
the cracs from last
summer are still open.
Pools of water often
form in the hollows
of old coppice stools,
having run down the
trunks. They must often
be the only water
available for long periods
after other sources have 
dried up.
Oxlips are flowering
poorly this year, probably

7165
because of the drought.
Such flowers as have
formed have nearly all
been ripped off, apparently
by sparrows from the
stack-yard of Hatley Park
farm.
Back holes, often
elongated and sinuous,
occur frequently. They
have a definite, though
scanty, ground flora, in-
cluding:
Glechoma hederacea
Ranunculus ficaria
Filipendula ulmaria
Young Arum
young Primula elatior.
They are all dry at
present.

[7166-7167]
7166
Iris foetidissima occurs
at the edge of the cop-
piced area.

1. Hypholoma fasciculare. Rare,
on elm.

2. Crepidotus nollis. A small
group on a rotten log.

3.Coprinus micaceus.

4. Mitrophora gigas. Frequent,
mainly isolated.

April 25. 
Hayley Wood.
Oxlips are flowering
less well than in pre-
vious years, but

7167
damage by birds is 
negligible compared with
Buff Wood.
Violets are unusually
flourishing in both cop-
piced areas.
The ground is very
dry, with cracks in
places. The only stan-
ding water is in some
unusually deep ruts in
the N.W. ride.

The 26. 
The ducks left the
nest yesterday, about 7 a.m.
on Sunday morning. They
went out to the main
gate, where the Porter
held up the traffic for
them to cross the road
and saw them into St
Catharine's.
April 27.
The Primulas in Leck-
hampton are at least as
numerous as in previous
years. The yellow cows-
lips occupy a much
larger area than the

[7170-7171]
7170
hybrids.
April 28.
Self-sown Impatiens
parviflora plants are coming
up in St Michael's church-
yard.
April 29.
Lathraea clandestina
appears to be as widespread
at the Botanic Gardens
as ever before.
April 30.
Two permanent quadrats
of 1 dm square were staked
out in the densely-sown
stands of Impatiens parvi-
flora being grown for seed
in the open at the Botanic
Gardens. One (N.) is in the 
part where the crop is

7171
more vigorous as a result
of digging a sump there some
years ago. The other (S.)
is well away from this
region. Numbers per quadrat[????]

Hayley Wood.
Visited with the Master
and certain Fellows of Corpus
Christi College.
The flowering of oxlips,

[7172-7173]
7172
at its peak last week, is
getting over. Bluebells are
before their peak.
Orchis mascula is
very abundant and
flowering well.
Deer tracks are
abundant near the
pond. In this part of
the wood are numerous
tracks through the mer-
cury, presumably made
by the deer; they are
somewhat wider than
badgers' paths.
The ride shown in O.S.
maps along the W. side of
"Hayley Ditch" [!!!!]alo[!!!!] in the
E. quarter of the wood
undountedly exists, and is

7173
not very overgrown. No
sedum telephium was found,
despite looking.
Parts of the lower jaw
(including teeth) and pelvis
of a large mammal were
found along this Ditch well
inside the wood. They 
hae been much gnawed
by rodents, whose teeth-
-marks are clearly visible.
May 3.
Lathraea clandestina.
This plant has re-
covered most of its range

Overhall Grove.
The whole wood is 
very uniform. There are
a few big oaks (including
one giant) in the S. part,
and a few stumps. Other-
wise, the rather, uniform
elm stand of the N. part
is maintained to the S.
end. There is some variation
in the size of elms; some
are very large.
The oxlips have long

7183

taken from different plants
near the S. end of the
wood show the short
petriole and slight nigosity
characteristic of hybrids.
Very little fruit has been set.

Hypholoma fasciculare. Oak

There is a very fine
wet hollow in the wood
at the narrowing where
a stream crosses it.
The wood is very
dry underfoot nearly as
dry as Hayley. The only
standing water is in the
above hollow (still very ex-

[7184-7185]

tensive), in the great ditch
in the N.E> side, and in 
a small part of the inner
moat.
Two miserable, but
living, spruces are the
only trees growing on the
middle of the keep.
The ancient pollard
elms at Knapwell are all
extremely burred. There
is one pollard maple among
them, and a few pollard
willows. One of the latter
has an oak tree several
years old growing on it.

Badgers.
The great central sett
is very active, and there

7185
are now about 15 holes,
from some of which great
quantities of earth have
recently been thrown out.
The badgers are said to
have unearthed Norman
pot-sherds.
The northern sett was

A third sett was found
(O.R.) on the E. side of the
moated mound ("adulter-
ine castle") near Knapwell
church. Near top of mound,

zygomorphic.
May 22.
Saxifraga granulata is 
extremely abundant in the
cemetery at Bungay, inclu-
ding Grandfather's grave.
It is well established in
the newer part of the
cemetery but hardly at all
in adjoining fields.

7189
Vicia sativa and hirsuta
are also abundant in the
cemetery.
Xanthoria has reached 
5/16 in. diam. on Grandfather's
tomb-stone. Many other lichens occur.
South Elmham Minster
is in the midst of a
grove of hornbeams in
the moated area. The
trees are widely spaced
and do not appear to
have been pollarded or
coppiced. There are many
trees of other species mixed
with the hornbeams.
Inside the Minster itself is
a gigantic but decaying
ash, broken off about 15 ft
high. A very large dead

[7190-7191]
7190
oak, probably the fallen tree
in Taylor & Taylor's diagram
of the Minster, has been
sawn across. Although
4 1/2 ft diam., it is only c.150
years old. A felled hornbeam
2 1/4 ft diam. is c.150 years
old.
In hedges just out-
side the Minster grove 
are a few very large
pollard hornbeams, about
60 ft high with trunks
over 3 ft diam., probably 
of great antiquity and
some decaying. Other large
hornbeams occur in a
row along the road in
front of the entrance to the 
Hall.

Monks' Wood.
This differs very con-

[7194-7195]
7194
composition. Most of the
oaks were felled shortly
after the first war. The 
tops were not left. The
coppice is mainly ash,
hazel, and maple; among
it is much birch and
Populus tremula, with little
P. Canescens. Elm is very
scarce: a circular patch
rather similar to the western
area in Hayley was seen;
this is attributed to sucker-
ing. Sorbus aria is by
no means rare: a tree
up to 40 ft high, in habit
like an hornbeam, with
curiously-shaped leaves.
At the bottom of the
wood is a complex series

7195
of clearings and abandoned
clearings. Abandoned clearings
develop into pure birch.
Platanthera chlorantha,
Listera, and Neoltia are abun-
dant and unusually large.
Listera shows the pollinial
behaviour well with a pencil.
Calamagrostis epigeios is
frequent along rides; C.
canescens occurs in the
big mown clearing.
Aulacomnium [!!!!]androgynum[!!!!]palustre

Quy Fen.
The name is a misnomer.
It is really a common
belonging to Stow, Quy,
Horningsea, and Fen Ditton,
and used for grazing

7199
cattle. It is grassland,
floristically poor but with a
few chalk species, entirely
on chalky mineral soil.
THere is a big pit in the
middle, with two smaller
pits near the common
outside it. Most of the
area is open, but there
are many hawthorn
bushes, mostly well spaced
but grouped near the ponds;
in addition there are
Salix alba trees and a few
small oaks.
Cirsium arvense is
abundant, universally infected
(and sometimes severeley
damaged) by Puccinia
suaveolens.

[7200-7201]
7200
The big central pit is
fringed with reeds. It 
contains Ranunculus cir-
cinatus (lime-incrusted)
and Hippuris. Polygala
vulgaris and Linum cather-
ticum occur on its banks.
The pit just outside
the common at the N.W.
corner contains the follow-

Eleocharis palustris
Alopecurus aequalis (not genic-
ulatus)*
Veronica catenata

The horizontal beam
which spans the stairs of
F Staircase, New Court, 
and carries the wooden
stairs to the attic, is
rotten at one end
where it emerges from
the wall. The only ex-
ternal sign was a
slight settling of the
beam due to compression
of the rotten underside, 
and a longitudinal
crack underneath resul-
ting from unevenness of

7203
compression. About a
quarter of the section
of the beam, on the under-
side, is attacked. The rot
is pale brown and pow-
dery. Probably Poria Vaillantii.
June 10.
Armillaria has recently
been discovered in the area
between the glass-houses,
Main Walk, Broad Walk, and
rock garden at the Botanic
Gardens. An area of
about 60 yards diam. is 
affected.
[7204-7205] About half the
trees and shrubs in this
area show some loss of
vigour and top die-back.
Berberis and Prunus spp
are the most affected.

7204
Following a dry spell, a
few of each have suddenly
wilted and died altogether.
Rhizomorphs have been
found by Dr Rishbeth at
the foot of several ailing
or dead trees and shrubs.
The source of the attack is
not known.

Gamlingay.
On the surviving frag-
ment of Gamlingay Cinques
Common, work was done
on digging a pool and 
clearing away excessive

7205
growth of rose-bay.
The surviving part is 
a small old gravel-pit of
about 5 acres. Most of
the area is furze. Heather
formerly occurred locally,
but has not been seen
since part of the area
was burnt last year.
Prunus spinosa and
sallows cover much of the
area.
In the lowest part
is a damp hollow containing
much Eleocharis palustris,
Hydrocotyle, and Ranunculus
flammula. Here a pool
was dug. Much rubbish
was got out, all quite
recent. Water was struck

[7206-7207]
7206
about 2 ft down and
gushed out rapidly, mak-
ing a small pool. The 
turves which had been
removed were replaced
in the pool and on its
sides.
The soil here is a 
ferruginous sand. Near
the surface were large:
irregular clinker-like masses
of iron ore with charac-
teristic pipes interwoven.
Some of these contained
plant roots. They were
up to 1/2 in. internal diameter,
lined with a hard black
ore. Just above the
place where water was
struck, the sand was

7207
reduced to a pinkish
colour, though mostly stained
greenish black by humus.
This rapidly reverted to
golden brown when the
sand was exposed. The 
[!!!!]area[!!!!]sand below the water
table, however, was oxidized.

White Wood is a
strange mixture of native
and introduced species,
on greensand. Mainly
oak; Tilia cordata is
abundant, and reputedly
native; there are many
pines, spruces, and other
conifers. Rhododendron pon-
ticum and other exotics are
planted in the undergrowth.

[7208-7209]
7208
In this wood is a
circular patch of Conval-
laria of about an actre,
well known locally and
recorded for 200 years.
It is remarkably regular,
despite the tracks which
run through it. There is
no sign of marginal vigour
or central decadence.
It flowered copiously this
year and the old infls
are visible, but no fruit
was set.
