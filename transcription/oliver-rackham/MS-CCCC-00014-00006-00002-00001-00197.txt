Hatfield Forest Cont. 16 Nov. 1971
8. No pollards in boundary
banks

Rhamnus is not a normal
constituent of scrub. A single huge
one at the E. end of Beggar's 
Hall Coppice in internal scrub.

Mistletoe
Remarkably abundant in 
the scrubs and in isolated trees
in launds.
Chiefly on hawthorn. Also
maple (near Forest Lodge) and
in the top of two over-mature
Populus canadenois trees near
London Bridge. See also p.5440.


[15466-15467]
[DIAG]
Effects of coppicing.
In Hanman's Coppice regrowth
has reached c. 5ft high
after probably 4 years
herbaceous vegetation
mainly of the shorter
summer-leafing plants.
Apparently little affected
by grazing

Forest Lodge
Apparently a 17th-cent.
timber-framed building

November 17.
Heavy snowfall forming
a persistent layer about 1 1/2 in.
deep.

November 18.
Snow melted. Snow showers
during the day.

[15468-15469]
November 20.
Hayley Wood. Party uner police
escort to fill in holes dug in Hayley
Lane by Mr Cooper.
It proved possible to get a 
Land-Rover along the old railway
into Triangle Ride and to remove
some logs.
[DIAG]
The elms in
Hayley Lane are 
more complex than 
was thought. Clone (1)
with early leaf-fall
does not extend S. of 
the road, and is separated
from it by Clone (2),
described here,
most of which
lies N of the road but a few
small trees lie S. Presumably it
marks the gap of a wider road.

Hayley Lane elm. N. of road [????]
just S.
Young mature, suckers
Strongly suckering
Bk fissured to platly
Br. horizontal, somewhat elbowed
Tw. not hin, irreg.
Young branches with moderate
corky flanges
Lvs late falling (4), twisted.

1971 coppice, [!!!!] hazel,
and similar 1-year-old hazel
in Triangle ride, still in full
leaf and badly frosted.
A hole some 5 ft high 
has been torn in the N.E.
side of the deer-fence net.
No general damage inside,

[15470-15471]
but many shoots of a sallow
stool frayed for c.18 in. up
and broken.

November 21
Broussonetia papyrifera. Moracea.
Now flowering in the Botanick Gar-
den. Has a remarkable globular
inflorescence about 1/2 in. dia., a 
ball of green hairy bracts from which scarlet bifurcating fleshy corollas protrude.

November 24.
Fallen elm, Trumpington Road
[DIAG]
Branch
c. 2" dia.
near top of 
tree
'56
'52 on same branch
Severe wetwood elsewhere in tree.
These are brown stains
following the same course as
those of Dutch elm disease,
but pale to medium colour
instead of dark. No sign
of the disease in the tree this
year.
