Hatfield Forest Cont. 16 Nov. 1971
8. No pollards in boundary
banks

Rhamnus is not a normal
constituent of scrub. A single huge
one at the E. end of Beggar's 
Hall Coppice in internal scrub.

Mistletoe
Remarkably abundant in 
the scrubs and in isolated trees
in launds.
Chiefly on hawthorn. Also
maple (near Forest Lodge) and
in the top of two over-mature
Populus canadenois trees near
London Bridge. See also p.5440.

herbaceous vegetation
mainly of the shorter
summer-leafing plants.
Apparently little affected

Hayley Wood. Party uner police
escort to fill in holes dug in Hayley
Lane by Mr Cooper.
It proved possible to get a 
Land-Rover along the old railway
into Triangle Ride and to remove
some logs.
[DIAG]
The elms in
Hayley Lane are 
more complex than 
was thought. Clone (1)
with early leaf-fall
does not extend S. of 
the road, and is separated
from it by Clone (2),
described here,
most of which
lies N of the road but a few
small trees lie S. Presumably it
marks the gap of a wider road.

Hayley Lane elm. N. of road [????]
just S.
Young mature, suckers
Strongly suckering
Bk fissured to platly
Br. horizontal, somewhat elbowed
Tw. not hin, irreg.
Young branches with moderate
corky flanges
Lvs late falling (4), twisted.

1971 coppice, [!!!!] hazel,
and similar 1-year-old hazel
in Triangle ride, still in full
leaf and badly frosted.
A hole some 5 ft high 
has been torn in the N.E.
side of the deer-fence net.
No general damage inside,

[15470-15471]
but many shoots of a sallow
stool frayed for c.18 in. up
and broken.

November 21
Broussonetia papyrifera. Moracea.
Now flowering in the Botanick Gar-
den. Has a remarkable globular
inflorescence about 1/2 in. dia., a 
ball of green hairy bracts from which scarlet bifurcating fleshy corollas protrude.

November 24.

Severe wetwood elsewhere in tree.
These are brown stains
following the same course as
those of Dutch elm disease,
but pale to medium colour
instead of dark. No sign
of the disease in the tree this
year.



[15472-15473]
Trunk of the tree (aboout
12" dia.) show wet-wood
to within c. 1" of the bark.
Recent extension to the
cambium in places. Boun-
dary rather ill-defined for
wet-wood. Star cracks few
and very narrow.
Tree is probably v. glabra.
Leafless this year and fell in
a recent gale.

Further snow showers but
none lying.

transition from wide to narrow
rings at 47 y., 58 y (numbering 
from 1971 = 1; 1st narrow ring 
in each case). also 64, 69.
Appears to have been a 
general coppicing in 1899, and 
possible drawing in 1924.

2. Mycena galericulata. Frequent,

animals.

Deer Fence.
Broken through in several
places with holes some feet
wide; all these big gaps are
in the N.W. of the plot. Numerous
smaller holes. No apparent
general damage to the coppice.
On the N.W. side three bays
of the fence are torn down
from the poles completely and
a part of the net is missing.
The carcases of two deer
found entangled in the net on
the N.E. side; one in the un-
coppiced length and the other
in the coppiced. Both very
decayed (probably not there
when the Wood was visited a
month ago). Identification un-
certain but very small for fal-
low. No antlers. One had been
covered with innumerable white


[15476-15477]
grubs now dead (frost). They
had apparently run their heads
through the mesh and strangled
themselves by twisting the net
The net is black nylon
string of 4 in. square mesh, 6ft
high.

1-year-old hazel coppice
is mostly still in green leaf,
the majority of the leaves being
frosted.
Ash coppice is partly in
a similar state.
Leaf-fall in oakes appears
to be delayed by frost. One
small oak in the W. section
still has green leaves. Other-
wise the leaves are fully brown
but stay on the trees. 

A smell probably of Mr
Cox's maggot factory permeates
the N. Section.
The Wood has rapidly
got wetter. Water in the an-
cient boundary ditch and in
quantity in several black-holes.

The Bourn Brook has risen
to cover the B1046 at the
ox-bow W. of Toft bridge.

About 32 of the ancient
elms of Newmarket Road re-
main, on the E. side N. of Dan-
iels Road. Genetically uniform,
probably U. procera. Gaps have
been filled with other elms,
of which some U. ?hollandica
are now mature, and the 
younger ones are Cornish
elms (also much planted
around Eaton & Cringleford).
The old Cringleford Bridge
is largely unaltered.

December 11.
Anne Hart says that accor-
ding to the factory men some
ash stools in the Bradfield
Woods always produce sinu-
ous poles which are little use
for handles. On looking at 
stools in Bottom Fell this does ap=
pear to be genetically determined.
All the poles on the stool
share teh character and the
sinuosity is usually continued
all the way up the stem into the 
topmost twigs. Several degrees
of sinuosity can be recognized.
The character can be used
to distinguish ash clones and
thus to separate two or 
more clones in a group of
stools. some rings of ash stools
up to c. 15 ft dia. are seen
by this method to be of
clonal origin as had previ-

[15482-15483]
ously been suspected.

Evernia furturacea. On sal-
low stem, MPW side of Fish
Pond.

Cladonia coniocraea. On bark
of bat willow, FHW side of Fish 
Pond.

Coppicing Bottom Fell.
About 12 people turned
up.
A total of about 3/4 acre
of 1958 growth has now been
cut. Proportion of stools: 40
hazel: 30 alder: 15 ash: 10 sal-
low: 5 birch. Standard trees
about 4 per acre, including
two fine matrue ash. [!!!!] Pole
sized oaks about 6 per acre.
in the N. of the coppiced 
area is about 1/2 acre of
mor type litter a few in.
deep on top of a sub-podsol
with bleached sand grains.
Rather dry with no stan-
ding water.

Factory coppicing.
About 4,000 handles of
hazel, ash, birch, sallow have
been drawn from Bottom Fell
and Strawberry Bank. Felling
is very selective. Tops left on
site by special instruction.
The factory men claim to have
exhausted Bottom Fell but it is
unlikely that they reached the


[15484-15485]
W. part. In Strawberry Bank
they cut a number of racks
into the wood and worked
within a few hards of these.
No wet-wood so far seen.
Small mammals nosy after
sunset.

Roses still flower freely
in the garden and elsewhere in
Harvey Lane.

December 20 [64th]
Lion Wood
Largely unaffected by the

[15488-15489]
[DIAG]
flats & houses built on the
site of Mousehold House gardens
(Mousehold House itself appears
to be flats and a shop).
Chiefly oak, large and
apparently fast-grown standards
of varied habit and some
with a corkscrew tendency.
Elm dominant around Pil-
ling Park and sporadic elsewhere.
Ash local.
Scots pine grouped in front
of the house; large mature
trees perhaps in rows.
Beech frequent in mixture
in the same area. One gigantic
but perhaps fast-grown beech
pollard at A.
Holly and Rhododendron
frequent. Other shrubs few.
Ground vegetation sparse,
mainly brambles and bracken.
Wood mostly 1-storeyed,
apparently unevenaged. No coppice.
Margin to Wellsely Avenue
now a gradual transition. At

[15490-15491]
B there is a shallow wood
bank which delimits the oc-
currence of big trees. The open
ground in Wellesley Avenue is
grass & bracken; the latter
appears to restrict invasion by
trees.
Other wood edges much
altered by building and other 
development.
Ground surface with steep
and complex slopes but no
evidence of gravel digging.

A typical acid gravel wood,
in some respects like Tiger
Hill. Not much affected by
19th-cent. planting. No positive
evidence of antiquity.

December 21.
Lion Wood.
The E. part of the wood is
in a dry valley CD with steep
apparently natural sides.
Big standard oaks mostly
of curving habit.
About 6 gigantic over-mature
rowans, c. 40 ft high, c. 1 1/4 ft
dia.
Towards D there are several 
hornbeams of varying ages.

Flowers and a few nearly ripe
fruit on the strawberry tree in
Leckhampton.

January 1. [DIAG] 1972
Although gray squirrels are
very numerous in Leckhampton,
and have been for at least a
year, there is no evidence of
appreciable damage except to the 
golden poplar.

Jan. 12. Buff Wood
1963 & 1971 plot.
Dense growth of stout brambles
with deeply grooved stems.
About 6 ft high. Still green.

Ash appears to have been
coppiced 1951 in N.W. corner of

1. Ozoniem[????] abundant on
decayed oak, bank of 1972 plots.

2. Pleurotho ? ulmari[????] about
20 ft up a diseased elm clone E.

All but one of the elms in
clone E which were severely 
affected by Dutch elm disease
have been felled & burnt.
pleurotus: some 20 sporophores
laterally attached, in tufts, on
main trunk. Gills white or
pale pink. P. probably white. The
tree is that which has shown
severe Dutch elm disease in
former years but was almost
clear this year.

Variation in ash stools ap-
pears to be similar in kind
to that in FHW but less in
degree. The large compound
stool straddling the ditch at A
is clearly clonal, with an unu-
sually sinuous habit for the wood.

[15498-15499]
and [!!!!] notably few and thick
twigs.

Coppice in the 1963-71
plot is mainly hazel to c. 1 1/2 "
dia. with dense ground-ash
in places. Not much ash
or maple coppice because few
of the overgrown stools were
cut completely. Brambles form
a complete lower canopy
over much of the plot. Hazel
generally low and spreading.
Most of the felling is being
done with a circular saw on a 
pole. The poles from the last
felling are largely rotted and
are not now much of a hazard.

Still little surface water. Many
of the ditches empty. Only hollows
with standing water are on the
S.E. ride and these are quite
small.
Shoots of ?oxlip x primrose
visible, als mercury. Old primrose
leaves green.

[DIAG]

[15500-15501]
A warm and almost cloudless
day.

January 14.
Fir Wood, Stanton.
Probably a mixed coppice.
largely grubbed out in the 
last few weeks.

[DIAG]

High Wood, 
Stanton.
Still substantially
intact.

Hinderclay Wood.
With Colin Ranson.

The N.W. edge of the wood
is probably an old ditched
ride, with the dtich on the
field side deepened and a 
very slight bank formed.
The track thereby formed has
been obliterated where it
leaves the wood and crosses the
flield to the S.W. Elsewhere
it is largely covered with
scrub. Dead straight.

First cross-ride ditched on
the S.W., second on both sides,
third not ditched; but none
of them are ditched where
they leave the plateau to the 
S.E. of the wood.

Cherry occurs solely as
2 sapling trees in the N.W.
boundary track. No mature
trees seen.

Carex ripenia is abundant
in ditches by the N.W. end of the


[15502-15503]

[DIAG]

2nd ride, and right across the
boundary track. The site is not
particularly wet. Leaves narrow,
glaucous, folded: identification certain.
