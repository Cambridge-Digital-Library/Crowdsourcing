Large hornbeam std
0.20 yards to S.W.
641/2 dia., not pollard

22x7.8m

This area has a very
high concentration of mai-
5011
den saplings and few or
no large stools.  Looks like
recent woodland but there
is little evidence. Ground
not particularly waterlogged.
Possibly this is derived from
an area of standards in
bracken similar to that
which astill exists further S.W.
  The western transition
area varies very substantially
in species and age compo-
sition, and this is not re-
presentative of the whole.
Considerable areas near the
W. margin are standards 
(usually oak but a few
big hornbeam) in bracken
with evidence of cop-
[15012-15013]
5012
pice.
Hornbeam status.
  The S.W. hornbeam area,
although much purer than
the N.E., has a few birch
nd poplar trees, a very 
few ash stools near the
transition edges, and a 
few oaks of pioneer form.
Traces of bracken ground
cover. Stools generally large.
  [!!!!]This area could 
possibly be scondsary to a
bracken glade. Soil prob-
ably lighter than in the N.E.
hornbeam area.
  Hornbeam is probably
the most successfully re-
5013
generating tree in the wood.
The diferences in enumer-
ation between the two horn-
beam areas are explicable
on age since last cutting.

Hayley Wood.
Elm disease occurs in the
Hayley Lane Hedge and in its
northern continuation. Yelowing
and slight defoliation of the
upper brnches of a few pole-
-sized elms.
It occurs in a severer
form in two places on rhe E.
side of Wood (see later).
Yellowing widespread over
perhaps 1 acre. A few trees
[15020-15021]
5020
near the boundary completely
defoliated (all these on land
claimed by Mr Horsford). The
disease is at its mst severe
on the wood margin and de-
clines inwards; it affects
chiefly small pole-sized trees
and the tops of larger poles.
None of the big elms appears
to be affected.
  There is an outbreak
with mild defoliation around
the big overmature elm on
the N.W. of the E. elm grove;
the big tree itself is almost
clear.

  Euphrasia was found on
the Triangle railway verge (see map).

  An establishment of some
250 acres of grassland, mostly
rough grazing, some meadows. Con-
sists of an old house (probably not
permanently inhabited), the chapel,
and a gigantic new farmhuse,
hay-barn, and cow-house ([SYMBOL] 6).
Surrounded by several miles of 
stone walls (mostly of rather
small boulders laid dry and
not kept in repair) including a
ring-wall and two enclosures
near the houses,one of these
for a small secondary house.
Not known if the Hochleger is
walled off from the rest.
  Between Stiftsalm and
Kolderer the road passes

woods.  Above Kolderer (a
burnt-out farm on Tulferberg)
it is well-engineered (19th vcent)
with votive piuctues in one bad
place hewn out of the cliffs.
Intended for vehicles.
  Tulferberg and Voldererberg
are dispersed settlements of
large isolated farms.  No open
field.
  No alders at Orler.
  Ulmus glabra occurs as 
saplings some 9 ft high in road-
side scrub around Bramor, reach-
ing 900 m. No disease.
  Peucedanum ostruthium
occurs rarely in meadows
near Naturfreundehaus.

  The range including Hane-
burger, Sunbiger, and Naviser Son-
enopitze, beyond Voldertal, looks
similar but much more barren.
Glungezer itself is a
slight prominence in its ridge
with little view. Sonnenspitze
([SYMBOL] 15) is a forbidding black
barren mountain of unstable
rock.
  Cirsium spinosissimum is
rare in this district.

but very few dead or

  At its upper limit this 
and the middle age classes
disappear.  Last veteran
trees c. 2100 m., though
young rees frequent above
this. Rhododendron and
Vaccinium continue in
sheltered places to c. 2200 m.
  Note that Pinus mugo is
seldom dominant in Tulfein.
Juniper is abundant mixed
with ericoids.

1700-1940: closed forest of
Pinus cewmbra doiminant; some
spruce, very little larch. At

denser, taller, and with one
trunk instead of several at
high altitudes. This forest ap-
pears to be in largely even-
agd patches. Some of these
have little undergrowth. Rhodo-
dendron usually dominant.
Little recent logging although
roads have become more nu-
merous and better in the lasdt
few years.
1500-1700: spruce with P.
cembra and somelarch. Low-
altitude form of P. cembra
with one rather thin trunk,
short narrow crown.
Only the park-wood
contains fallen timber in
quantity and that not great.

  Ranunculus glacialis was
found occasionally on bare
earth on the highest peaks.
  The ridge falls to Voldertal
in terrible crags. On the Viggar
side there are broad screes
down to the bare rock and
turf around the small glacial
lakes in the uppermost Kar.
The ridge itself has tracts
of huge rather unstable boul-
ders (forming, for instance, the 
summit of Gamslahnersp. itself)
and strange tor-like rock
towers.
  This area is little fre-
quented despite its nearness to 
Innsbruck.  Very few people in
the Glungezerhutte.

  The skiing route and its
works have resulted in a 
levelled and grsded track some
200 yardss wide from Tulfein Alm
to Halsmeister and beyond. It
follows the ridge and cuts
some of the loops of the ld
road.  It has been sown with
grss under straw; some of
this has become established.
  Considerable snow in the
early morning;  most of this 
disappeared later.
