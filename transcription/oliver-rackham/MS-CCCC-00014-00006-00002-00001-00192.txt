Large hornbeam std
0.20 yards to S.W.
641/2 dia., not pollard

22x7.8m

This area has a very
high concentration of mai-
5011
den saplings and few or
no large stools.  Looks like
recent woodland but there
is little evidence. Ground
not particularly waterlogged.
Possibly this is derived from
an area of standards in
bracken similar to that
which astill exists further S.W.
  The western transition
area varies very substantially
in species and age compo-
sition, and this is not re-
presentative of the whole.
Considerable areas near the
W. margin are standards 
(usually oak but a few
big hornbeam) in bracken
with evidence of cop-
[15012-15013]
5012
pice.
Hornbeam status.
  The S.W. hornbeam area,
although much purer than
the N.E., has a few birch
nd poplar trees, a very 
few ash stools near the
transition edges, and a 
few oaks of pioneer form.
Traces of bracken ground
cover. Stools generally large.
  [!!!!]This area could 
possibly be scondsary to a
bracken glade. Soil prob-
ably lighter than in the N.E.
hornbeam area.
  Hornbeam is probably
the most successfully re-
5013
generating tree in the wood.
The diferences in enumer-
ation between the two horn-
beam areas are explicable
on age since last cutting.

Hayley Wood.
Elm disease occurs in the
Hayley Lane Hedge and in its
northern continuation. Yelowing
and slight defoliation of the
upper brnches of a few pole-
-sized elms.
It occurs in a severer
form in two places on rhe E.
side of Wood (see later).
Yellowing widespread over
perhaps 1 acre. A few trees
[15020-15021]
5020
near the boundary completely
defoliated (all these on land
claimed by Mr Horsford). The
disease is at its mst severe
on the wood margin and de-
clines inwards; it affects
chiefly small pole-sized trees
and the tops of larger poles.
None of the big elms appears
to be affected.
  There is an outbreak
with mild defoliation around
the big overmature elm on
the N.W. of the E. elm grove;
the big tree itself is almost
clear.

  Euphrasia was found on
the Triangle railway verge (see map).
