Small rookery c. 10 nests.
Interior of wood is mainly
MB.
Soil.
Mostly mull-small
patches with mor tendency,
not reflected in vegetation
(e.g. Clematis grows vigorously
in such areas).
Surface with slight hollows.
Appears quite well drained
throughout.
Earthworks.
Boundary bank only.
Broad flat, some 3-4 ft
above ditch, rather like Elm-
sett and Monks' Park. Corners
conspicuously rounded, the S.
being the sharpest and the W. the gentlest. Probably
no straight sides.
Woodland structure.
3-layered outside elm areas.
Standards entirely oak
(save a few elm). Oaks
genetically very variable,
about 10[SYMBOL] of them burred.
Diameter usually c. 3ft, some
50ft high, trunks generally
straight. No stumps of pre-
vious fellings.
The oaks are now being
felled. Trunks said to be
very valuable. Nearly all

[15538-15539]

sound, a few with incipient
heart-rot. Annual rings
very variable in width; no
obvious cycles.
A few oaks particularly
near the margin are scrubb,
rotten, or struck by lightning.
Oak canopy c. 40[SYMBOL] (at
about 15 to the acre).
Large coppice maple, mostly
small to medium stools but a
few large. Ash remarkably
rare. (2 stools seen).
Small coppice hazel, low
density and poor quality.
3 large stools (c. 6ft
dia.) of Ulmus glabra,
of the usual type for these
woods.
Features.
1. Ridge site.
2. Slight hollows in surface.
3. Soil mainly of the dry calcareous
type.
4. Excellent wood-bank of the
Monks' Park type.
5. Good 3-layered structure.
6. Site with excellent growth of
oak and high density of stan-
dards.
7. Very high maple [SYMBOL] ash ratio.
8. Remarkably long list of trees &
shrubs (for so small a wood).
9. Fine series of boundary pollards
of various species.
10. Elm situation with giant stools

[15540-15541]

of Ulmus glabra, boundary pol-
lards of Elm B, and invasion
by Elm A which both coppices &
suckers.
11. Elm invasion vigorous, of the
Hayley type, but not killing
any oaks.
12. Clematis abundant, stems
often massive.
13. Ground vegetation chiefly Zones
5 and 6. Bluebells tend to be
marginal.
14. No oxlip.
15. Pear occurs as a single
giant standard tree ([SYMBOL] 16).
16. No hornbeam, cherry.
17. Holly present.
18. Giant stools of maple & elm,
not ash.
19. Ancient woodland plants:
(Mercury) No ivy
(Aspen) Anthriscus only
Melica marginal
Crat. [????] (but in minority)
This is certainly medieval
woodland but not necessarily
primary, and well-preserved.
The park-type earthworks sug-
gest that this was connected
with Woodcroft Park (Ely Coucher)
(cf name Park Farm nearby).
Court Wood, Glemsford.
1. Unusual slope situation exten-
ding onto valley floor and
abutting on fen.
2. Most of boundary very sinuous

[15542-15543]

with park-type boundary bank
across fen.
3. One internal bank slighter
than external.
4. One boundary pollard, a big
oak.
5. Soil distinctly acid in N.E.
with patches of bracken and
areas where red campion is
dominant in the ground vege-
tation. These extend only a few
yards from the edge. Whole
wood appears well-drained
apart from a small area in the
valley floor.
6. W. boundary is an obvious
truncation (for which map evidence).
7. Well-preserved 3-layered
structure.
