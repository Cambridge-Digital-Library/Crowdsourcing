Small rookery c. 10 nests.
Interior of wood is mainly
MB.
Soil.
Mostly mull-small
patches with mor tendency,
not reflected in vegetation
(e.g. Clematis grows vigorously
in such areas).
Surface with slight hollows.
Appears quite well drained
throughout.
Earthworks.
Boundary bank only.
Broad flat, some 3-4 ft
above ditch, rather like Elm-
sett and Monks' Park. Corners
conspicuously rounded, the S.
being the sharpest and the W. the gentlest. Probably
no straight sides.
Woodland structure.
3-layered outside elm areas.
Standards entirely oak
(save a few elm). Oaks
genetically very variable,
about 10[SYMBOL] of them burred.
Diameter usually c. 3ft, some
50ft high, trunks generally
straight. No stumps of pre-
vious fellings.
The oaks are now being
felled. Trunks said to be
very valuable. Nearly all

[15538-15539]

sound, a few with incipient
heart-rot. Annual rings
very variable in width; no
obvious cycles.
A few oaks particularly
near the margin are scrubb,
rotten, or struck by lightning.
Oak canopy c. 40[SYMBOL] (at
about 15 to the acre).
Large coppice maple, mostly
small to medium stools but a
few large. Ash remarkably
rare. (2 stools seen).
Small coppice hazel, low
density and poor quality.
3 large stools (c. 6ft
dia.) of Ulmus glabra,
of the usual type for these
woods.
Features.
1. Ridge site.
2. Slight hollows in surface.
3. Soil mainly of the dry calcareous
type.
4. Excellent wood-bank of the
Monks' Park type.
5. Good 3-layered structure.
6. Site with excellent growth of
oak and high density of stan-
dards.
7. Very high maple [SYMBOL] ash ratio.
8. Remarkably long list of trees &
shrubs (for so small a wood).
9. Fine series of boundary pollards
of various species.
10. Elm situation with giant stools

[15540-15541]

of Ulmus glabra, boundary pol-
lards of Elm B, and invasion
by Elm A which both coppices &
suckers.
11. Elm invasion vigorous, of the
Hayley type, but not killing
any oaks.
12. Clematis abundant, stems
often massive.
13. Ground vegetation chiefly Zones
5 and 6. Bluebells tend to be
marginal.
14. No oxlip.
15. Pear occurs as a single
giant standard tree ([SYMBOL] 16).
16. No hornbeam, cherry.
17. Holly present.
18. Giant stools of maple & elm,
not ash.
19. Ancient woodland plants:
(Mercury) No ivy
(Aspen) Anthriscus only
Melica marginal
Crat. [????] (but in minority)
This is certainly medieval
woodland but not necessarily
primary, and well-preserved.
The park-type earthworks sug-
gest that this was connected
with Woodcroft Park (Ely Coucher)
(cf name Park Farm nearby).
Court Wood, Glemsford.
1. Unusual slope situation exten-
ding onto valley floor and
abutting on fen.
2. Most of boundary very sinuous

[15542-15543]

with park-type boundary bank
across fen.
3. One internal bank slighter
than external.
4. One boundary pollard, a big
oak.
5. Soil distinctly acid in N.E.
with patches of bracken and
areas where red campion is
dominant in the ground vege-
tation. These extend only a few
yards from the edge. Whole
wood appears well-drained
apart from a small area in the
valley floor.
6. W. boundary is an obvious
truncation (for which map evidence).
7. Well-preserved 3-layered
structure.
[DIAG]
8. Density of standards lower
than in Lumpit, with more of both
coppice layers.
9. Ash remarkably rare. Large coppice

Evidence for ancient woodland
weaker than for Lumpit and
based mainly on earthworks. But
the woods strongly resemble each
other and are likely to be historically
similar. [cont. p. 5548]

Under tall
bracken,
whose rhizomes appear to
be limited to A and Ao.
Stable water level reached
in under 1/2 hour by seepage
from the sides.
A mouse fell into the
pit while unattended for c. 1/2
hour. It was got out alive
but despite A. Hart's attention
it soon died. To prevent
this in future the pit was
made with a ramp at one
end and branches laid in it.
Two rulers placed end to
end to record water level.
Some more coppice was cut.
Wood very wet but stan-
ding water only on rides.

[15548-15549]

Bluebells just visible.
Garlic and oxlips not seen.
Jan. 15 [cont. p.5545].
Broom Farm, Glemsford.
A derelict site. No buildings
seen. Overgrown with thick scrub.
A few old conifers.
Much rough grass remains in
the area, although some of the
meadow has been plowed up.
Several fine pollard oaks
remain along the stream.
Heracleum was seen with
newly-opened flowers near Broom
Farm.

Wood remarkably dry
without standing water any-
where. No visible cracks. The
stream runs fast but the
grips are mainly dry.
The stream is appar-
ently truly natural; it
runs in a very sinuous
course with numerous
U-bends, and does not bi-

[15554-15555]

sect stools [DIAG]
Fast running
with a little
waterfall where
it passes over
the root of
an ash tree.
Forms the
middle of
a definite internal valley.
The grips form a dendri-
tic system in straight lengths
sometimes bisecting stools.
Aspen frequent to abun-
dant. Trees pole-sized, in
groups, arisen since the
last coppicing (1929) and
many now dead or fallen.
Oak and ash show com-
parativ[!!!!]ely little genetic varia-
tion. Ash stools sometimes
distinguishable.
Hornbeam occurs in a
definite hornbeam area
where it is mixed with
ash and maple in the LC.
Edges of hornbeam area
rather well-defined. Stools
variable, up to c. 4ft dia.
Growth poor, poles to c.
4 in. All stools have grown
again after coppicing in 1954
and 1971.
Hornbeam standards c.
40ft high, c. 1 1/2ft dia., vari-
able in habit but typically
like those in Buff Wood with
well-defined dense crowns. Not

[15556-15557]

pollarded; at least one from
a stool.
Hornbeam does not
appear to acidify.
Oak standards large
by boulder-clay wood standards
(cf Lumpit Wood). One of
obvious stool origin seen.
Cherry occurs as a few
suckers and pole trees on the
N. margin. Much planted in
the Forestry Comm. part but
these trees are not old enough
to be the source.
Oxlips visible, in a few
cases with expanded leaves.
Mercury visible, frequently
with expanded leaves, now
frozen and probably damaged.
Sanicle is remarkably
abundant throughout the
N. half of the wood.
Carex pendula mainly
marginal in the reserve. In
the Commission part it is
dominant over substantial
areas.
There is some evidence
of a wood hedge alongside
the road. No pollards.
Clematis is marginal.
Honeysuckle rare.
The elm appears to be
carpinifolia (? x glabra).
Bark reticulated. Twigs
finedivaricate. Forms a
circular patch but suckers
weakly. Much of the trees

[15558-15559]

are of coppice origin. The
big tree has now collapsed
completely.
Ivy carpets the roadside
bank; otherwise only one
plant seen, and that up a tree.
Roadside bank is
wood-type, [!!!!] of moderate size.
c.3
Pimpinella: [!!!!]one[!!!!] plants
seen in roadside verge, iden-
tified by radical leaves
and old stems.
Coppicing.
Area cut in 1954 has
dense, but slender, crooked
and low, regrowth of all
[DIAG]

[15560-15561]

species (e.g hazel c. 1" dia).
No evidence of ground
vegetation remaining.
Regrowth from 1-year-
cut stools is c. 4ft high
in the case of hazel, c.
1ft with hornbeam. No
evidence of grazing. But
several hazel stools have
had part of the new
growth cut off with a
sharp knife, as in Buff
Wood, and removed. About
4 vigorous shoots per stool
were left. Cutting left some
shorts half cut through,
proving that it is artificial.
Sparse development of
Cirsium vulgare and other
tall herbs. No evidence of
increased oxlips. No Juncus.
Bryophytes.
Rather poor, particularly in
epiphytes. Habitats few: stools
low, and rotting logs few
and small.
Rhynchostegiella pumila.
Forestry Commission.
Largely felled or poisoned.
Planted with Sitka and
smaller quantities of beech,
Corsican, and cherry.
Appears to have been
similar to the remaining
part.

[15562-15563]

[DIAG]
Old boundary.
A considerable length
survives as hedges and
a baulk.
Old grassland may remain
S.E. of Little Hales Wood.
Features.
1. Soil uniform.
2. Variations of slope but at
present very dry.
3. Short length of good sinu-
ous bank of wood type.
4. Internal valley with
stream.
5. No definite boulder-clay
hollows.
6. Excellent structure with
notable standard trees.

Melica
Pimpinella - at roadside
margin
Carex remota
Epipactis helleborine
Plantanthera
11. Secondary woodland plants:
Anthriscus
Wild day with a terrible
N.E. wind and occasional
driving snow. Scrub on the
E. side of Hales Wood gives
excellent protection despite
its narrowness. Black ice
covering many of the mosses.
Bartlow Hills.
The largest (southern) of
the three great barrows is
much invaded by elm scrub
in the last few years. Trees
with abundant corky flan-
ges. Procera-like leaves.
? procera & glabra. Very
aggressive in suckering.
Woodland around the

[15566-15567]

Hills is mixed, with much
elm and birch. Thin under-
storey of hazel in places.
The boundary of dispersed
settlement is very sharp,
through Thicko in Ashdon.

Hayley Wood (deer fence).
Snow fell in the night
forming a thin permanent
layer.
Water to c.4 in. deep in
the wet hollows of the
1971 & 1972 coppice acres,
frozen c. 1/2" thick.
Deer fence closed and
nearly completed today.
Oxlips seldom more than
1/2" high - much more back-
ward than in Hales.
Signs of slight deer acti-
vity recently. There is a possi-
ble rutting circle within the
fenced area.
Two corner posts of the
fence started [DIAG]
to lift out
of the ground
as the line
wires were
tightened,
and had to
be winched
back and held by outside
guys.

Devil's Ditch (bush-clearing
on the Ditch Farm section).
Scrub in this part of the
Ditch has roughly this com-
position:

Rosa [????] 1[SYMBOL]
Rhamnus 4[SYMBOL]
Ligustrum 10[SYMBOL]
Elder 5[SYMBOL] - chiefly on

The ditch in this part
has a slight convex slope
and appears to be built of
soft chalk rubble.
Ivy carpets the ground
under all but the most
recent scrub; it just fails
to overlap with surviving turf
grasses. Abundant up trees.
Hawthorns very uneven -
aged. Ring counts difficult
but oldest seen c. 72 years
(c. 5" dia.)
About 2 in. have eroded
from the sides of the Ditch
in the lifetime of the oldest
thorns. Mr Clark says this

[15570-15571]

happens where the ground vege-
tation has been suppressed by
scrub growth. He may be right.
[DIAG]
A: some 200 yards of bank
removed, perhaps for road ma-
terial. Ditch undisturbed
BC : broad flat-topped
ditch, straight slope, largely
free of bush growth.
C: slight change of align-
ment.
CD: ditch of equal height
but without the flat top and
hence narrower. Largely
covered with scrub, recently
cleared in places.
DE and beyond: broad
flat-topped ditch with
convex slope.

[15572-15573]

A parish boundary
hedge is visible in places,
consisting of a row of
even-aged hawthorn bushes.
Along CD and elsewhere it
grows along the top. In
the region cleared today
there is no trace of a hedge
on top of the bank, but
the possible remains of
one halfway down the slope
(Mr Clark denies this).
Considerable areas S.W.
cleared
of C have been [!!!!]remove[!!!!] of
scrub, much of it of many
years' growth. After 1 or 2
years there is much re-
growth, chiefly of privet,
although the hawthorn
stools also coppice to a
large extent. Attempts to
poison them have been un-
successful. The turf does
not appear to have returned
except in places where bush
growth was recent.

Hayley Wood.
Planting oaks and clearing
brambles.
13 [!!!!]rabbit snares were
inadvertently removed from
the railway fence alongside
the Triangle. (They later
turned out to be legitimate,
put there by Peter Sell to
trap rabbits [!!!!]supposed to
come from the old railway
across the Triangle onto Mr
Horsford's land). The rabbits
had made runs under the
wire netting.
Several of the young
oaks in the Triangle have
died some years ago and
the sap-wood has rotted.
One of these was felled
as a hazard to the public.
Hazel is in flower on
the 1969 coppice plot and
occasionally the 1970 plot.
Very little water has
collected at the foot of
"Hayley Ditch" - only a
few inches in the dug-out

[15576-15577]

area.
The oak seedlings are
nearly all alive but few
are more than 1ft high.
They were planted in many
cases into water-filled
holes. As far as possible
they were set on slightly
raised sites, away from the
canopy of existing oaks,
and with no coppice stools
nearby.
Oak Planting.
1971 plot inside fence : 1.
1972 plot inside fence: 12.
1972 plot outside fence
(with much fewer standards) 24.
These are 1-year-old oaks
dug up from the nursery in Great
Glade, each with a divot of
turf from that area.
Brambles were cleared with
slashers from the N. half of
Great Glade.
A few deer tracks seen
which were more recent than
the heavy rains of the first

[15578-15579]

half of the week - but deer
activity still remarkably low.
Some of the party reported that
on leaving the wood they saw
two armed men in Mr Cox's
field by Hayley Lane who
said "unless they fence that
wood, they soon won't have
any deer left."
Oxlips less advanced than
they were in Hales Wood -
leaves not expanded and many
plants not visible at all.
Wood extremely wet.
Much surface water, and rides
rapidly churned into mud
by ordinary treading.
February [!!!!] 16 cont.
A lecture at 8.30 to 10p.m.

mainly in[!!!!]to oxlip-dominated, but
oxlip plants relatively sparse.
Mercury few and scattered.
Brambles dominant only in

Coppice cut in the last
4 years in about 1/2 acre
S.W. of the elm area, and
in a strip c. [????]0 yards wide
around the whole S.W., N.W.,
and N.E. margins. S.W. side
most recently out, wood
corded and stacked. Holly
bushes strictly untouched.
Coppice regrowth rather
less than in FHW: c. 3 1/2 ft
in first year, 5ft in 2nd, 6ft
in 3rd. Tall herbs including
thistles, Angelica, Hypericum
hirsutum & tetrapterum. No
evidence of an effect on
oxlips. Euphorbia amygdaloides

Deschampsia rare as a
coppice plant. Junci not recorded.
1. Good wood-banks.
2. Fairly long list of trees & shrubs.
3. Excellent structure, with

to ash than elsewhere in
Bradfield.
8. Good stand of elm coppices.

Area coppiced in Bottom
Fell: 1.4 ac[!!!!]res. Dimensions

Fishpond Fell is somewhat
exposed to the S.W. in places
where the marginal bushes
and rubbish have been tidied
up.
No activity in Miss George's
wood, though the paths are
much used.
A narrow strip of bushes
has been cut along the
N.W. side of Cottage Ride,
apparently in preparation
for a drainage scheme. The
ride ditch is certainly down-
hill for a short distance,
but[!!!!] blocked at present.
There is howe[!!!!]r a substan-
tial flow in the ditch S.E. of
Roots.
Mr Knox has largely
cleared Park Fell to the
root-burning stage. This is
clearly visible from St Clare

[15594-15595]

Hall through a thin remaining
screen of trees. The big beech
in The Triangle has been left
standing. The boundary of
the cleared area leaves in-
N.W.
tact the [!!!!] end [!!!!]of[!!!!] (at least)
of the great bank in the s.
of Hannah's.
The stream draining out
of Malkin's does indeed
appear to lie in a slight
hollow.
The ditches crossing the
18 Acres have been piped.
Nothing now remains of the
ditches W. or E. from Wood-
house Fram.
The road approaching
Woodhouse. Farm from the
S.E. is lined by a sparse
row of hegderow-type elms
with very pendulous twigs
(the common "Hadleigh" type).
There is no appreciable
bank and no hedge between
the elms. Ann Hart says
there used to be a bank,
and on the air photograph
it is seen not to coincide
with the row of elms but
to lie a few yards N. The
elms in the surviving Barn
Fell are perhaps the same.
No primroses seen in
flower.
Oxlips slightly more
forward than in Hayley,

[15596-15597]

with distinct expanded
leaves.
Garlic generally visible;
leaves often expanded, oc-
casionally c. 6in. long. Smell
appreciable in coppicing.
One member of the party
saw a deer in Bottom Fell.
Sphagnum in the stream
in Plantation Fell appears
[!!!!] to be slightly increased.
Much of it is now submer-
ged. The surface Sphagnum
is apparently increased and
was seen in two sites not
before noticed. It occurs on
the ground, or on Polytrichum,
in hollows with standing
water just reaching the sur-
face of the litter. These sites,
and other wet hollows, have
been recently disturbed,
possibly by deer although
no distinct footmarks were
seen.
A beech sapling c. 4ft
high was seen under an
oak in the middle (not
recently coppiced) of Plan-
tation Fell.
The area of Bottom Fell
now being out contains much
good ash. One stool coppiced
was 8ft dia. with 20
usable poles. This particular
stool had a slight but
distinct mound of earth
in the middle in the manner

[15598-15599]

commonly shown by alder
and occasionally hazel.
About 60[SYMBOL] of the
big sallow poles now being
cut have a single goat-moth
(or similar) hole in the butt
log. Not seen in other
species, nor more than one
hole per log.
Alder logs nearly always
have numerous worm holes
appearing as red flecks in
T.S. They generally follow
the annual ring.
Rides very wet but little
surface water off them.
The Harts had a wash-
ing-machine fault due to a
mouse getting into the switch
and being electrocuted thereby.
This needed a new switch
at £13. To add insult to
injury, the cat made off
with the mouse and proudly
walked around carrying it.
Logs of standing dead
elm burn slowly and
well.
In the Bottom Fell coppice
area, part of an ancient
stool c. 8ft dia. x 2ft high
is invaded by Armillaria, ap-
parently quite saprophytically

Grazing in coppices.
The coppice fences appear
to be Victorian but are nowhere
maintained (except Gravelpit).
Grazing appears to be directly
responsible for the absence
of self-coppicing in [!!!!]hazel
(most marked in Spittelmore &
Elgin's, least marked in Street).
Also for the numerous scrubby
glades in most of the coppices
(this effect occurs even in
Street, but seldom).
The scrub margins to
coppices (most conspicuous on the
E. side of Haryman's, S.W. side of
Spittelmore, S.E. side of Street)
are distinctive. Mainly hawthorn
with much rose, and traces
of coppice structure or none.
This makes it almost certain
that grazing has caused dam-
age for half a century or
more.
Ground vegetation extremely
poor in woodland plants:
e.g. no primrose or oxlip seen
today. Possibly a result of
grazing in the latter coppice
cycle in past centuries.
Pollards.
Four occur only a few
yards outside the boundaries of
Hanpton's-Spittlemore-Street
coppices.
Three pollard hornbeams
seen inside [!!!!] Elgin's. They are

[15636]

about the size of the smallest
free-standing ones.
Ponds.
The one in Spittlemore is ex-
ceptionally large (c. 25 yards
long), nearly flat-bottomed, and
with only traces of a bank. It
represents the excavation and
removal of most of the contents.
The one in Street is ap-
parently dead straight, 250 yards
x c. 20ft, probably about 2ft
deep, with no trace of a bank.
Elm wet-wood.

sionally, but no definite dis-
