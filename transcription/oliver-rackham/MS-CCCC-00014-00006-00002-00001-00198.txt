Small rookery c. 10 nests.
Interior of wood is mainly
MB.
Soil.
Mostly mull-small
patches with mor tendency,
not reflected in vegetation
(e.g. Clematis grows vigorously
in such areas).
Surface with slight hollows.
Appears quite well drained
throughout.
Earthworks.
Boundary bank only.
Broad flat, some 3-4 ft
above ditch, rather like Elm-
sett and Monks' Park. Corners
conspicuously rounded, the S.
being the sharpest and the W. the gentlest. Probably
no straight sides.
Woodland structure.
3-layered outside elm areas.
Standards entirely oak
(save a few elm). Oaks
genetically very variable,
about 10[SYMBOL] of them burred.
Diameter usually c. 3ft, some
50ft high, trunks generally
straight. No stumps of pre-
vious fellings.
The oaks are now being
felled. Trunks said to be
very valuable. Nearly all

[15538-15539]

sound, a few with incipient
heart-rot. Annual rings
very variable in width; no
obvious cycles.
A few oaks particularly
near the margin are scrubb,
rotten, or struck by lightning.
Oak canopy c. 40[SYMBOL] (at
about 15 to the acre).
Large coppice maple, mostly
small to medium stools but a
few large. Ash remarkably
rare. (2 stools seen).
Small coppice hazel, low
density and poor quality.
3 large stools (c. 6ft
dia.) of Ulmus glabra,
of the usual type for these
woods.
Features.
1. Ridge site.
2. Slight hollows in surface.
3. Soil mainly of the dry calcareous
type.
4. Excellent wood-bank of the
Monks' Park type.
5. Good 3-layered structure.
6. Site with excellent growth of
oak and high density of stan-
dards.
7. Very high maple [SYMBOL] ash ratio.
8. Remarkably long list of trees &
shrubs (for so small a wood).
9. Fine series of boundary pollards
of various species.
10. Elm situation with giant stools

[15540-15541]

of Ulmus glabra, boundary pol-
lards of Elm B, and invasion
by Elm A which both coppices &
suckers.
11. Elm invasion vigorous, of the
Hayley type, but not killing
any oaks.
12. Clematis abundant, stems
often massive.
13. Ground vegetation chiefly Zones
5 and 6. Bluebells tend to be
marginal.
14. No oxlip.
15. Pear occurs as a single
giant standard tree ([SYMBOL] 16).
16. No hornbeam, cherry.
17. Holly present.
18. Giant stools of maple & elm,
not ash.
19. Ancient woodland plants:
(Mercury) No ivy
(Aspen) Anthriscus only
Melica marginal
Crat. [????] (but in minority)
This is certainly medieval
woodland but not necessarily
primary, and well-preserved.
The park-type earthworks sug-
gest that this was connected
with Woodcroft Park (Ely Coucher)
(cf name Park Farm nearby).
Court Wood, Glemsford.
1. Unusual slope situation exten-
ding onto valley floor and
abutting on fen.
2. Most of boundary very sinuous

[15542-15543]

with park-type boundary bank
across fen.
3. One internal bank slighter
than external.
4. One boundary pollard, a big
oak.
5. Soil distinctly acid in N.E.
with patches of bracken and
areas where red campion is
dominant in the ground vege-
tation. These extend only a few
yards from the edge. Whole
wood appears well-drained
apart from a small area in the
valley floor.
6. W. boundary is an obvious
truncation (for which map evidence).
7. Well-preserved 3-layered
structure.
[DIAG]
8. Density of standards lower
than in Lumpit, with more of both
coppice layers.
9. Ash remarkably rare. Large coppice

10. Fewer trees & shrubs than Lumpit.
11. Elms very tall (as in Bull's
Wood) but invasion weak and
limited. All elms are large poles
or small emergents.
Elm: very tall, suckering.
[????]W. fine divar[????]

12. Ground vegetation Zones 546.

16. Giant stools of hazel only.
17. Ancient woodland plants.
(Mercury) No ivy
(Aspen)
Evidence for ancient woodland
weaker than for Lumpit and
based mainly on earthworks. But
the woods strongly resemble each
other and are likely to be historically
similar. [cont. p. 5548]

A hole
2 1/2ft deep was
sunk in outer
Bracken Glade,
Middle Fell.
Soil profile
as above.
Substantial
p[????]lization.
Under tall
bracken,
whose rhizomes appear to
be limited to A and Ao.
Stable water level reached
in under 1/2 hour by seepage
from the sides.
A mouse fell into the
pit while unattended for c. 1/2
hour. It was got out alive
but despite A. Hart's attention
it soon died. To prevent
this in future the pit was
made with a ramp at one
end and branches laid in it.
Two rulers placed end to
end to record water level.
Some more coppice was cut.
Wood very wet but stan-
ding water only on rides.

[15548-15549]

Bluebells just visible.
Garlic and oxlips not seen.
Jan. 15 [cont. p.5545].
Broom Farm, Glemsford.
A derelict site. No buildings
seen. Overgrown with thick scrub.
A few old conifers.
Much rough grass remains in
the area, although some of the
meadow has been plowed up.
Several fine pollard oaks
remain along the stream.
Heracleum was seen with
newly-opened flowers near Broom
Farm.
January 17.
Aconites nearly in flower in
Cambridge. [SYMBOL]

Heracleum mantegazzianum

Wood remarkably dry
without standing water any-
where. No visible cracks. The
stream runs fast but the
grips are mainly dry.
The stream is appar-
ently truly natural; it
runs in a very sinuous
course with numerous
U-bends, and does not bi-

[15554-15555]

sect stools [DIAG]
Fast running
with a little
waterfall where
it passes over
the root of
an ash tree.
Forms the
middle of
a definite internal valley.
The grips form a dendri-
tic system in straight lengths
sometimes bisecting stools.
Aspen frequent to abun-
dant. Trees pole-sized, in
groups, arisen since the
last coppicing (1929) and
many now dead or fallen.
Oak and ash show com-
parativ[!!!!]ely little genetic varia-
tion. Ash stools sometimes
distinguishable.
Hornbeam occurs in a
definite hornbeam area
where it is mixed with
ash and maple in the LC.
Edges of hornbeam area
rather well-defined. Stools
variable, up to c. 4ft dia.
Growth poor, poles to c.
4 in. All stools have grown
again after coppicing in 1954
and 1971.
Hornbeam standards c.
40ft high, c. 1 1/2ft dia., vari-
able in habit but typically
like those in Buff Wood with
well-defined dense crowns. Not

[15556-15557]

pollarded; at least one from
a stool.
Hornbeam does not
appear to acidify.
Oak standards large
by boulder-clay wood standards
(cf Lumpit Wood). One of
obvious stool origin seen.
Cherry occurs as a few
suckers and pole trees on the
N. margin. Much planted in
the Forestry Comm. part but
these trees are not old enough
to be the source.
Oxlips visible, in a few
cases with expanded leaves.
Mercury visible, frequently
with expanded leaves, now
frozen and probably damaged.
Sanicle is remarkably
abundant throughout the
N. half of the wood.
Carex pendula mainly
marginal in the reserve. In
the Commission part it is
dominant over substantial
areas.
There is some evidence
of a wood hedge alongside
the road. No pollards.
Clematis is marginal.
Honeysuckle rare.
The elm appears to be
carpinifolia (? x glabra).
Bark reticulated. Twigs
finedivaricate. Forms a
circular patch but suckers
weakly. Much of the trees

[15558-15559]

are of coppice origin. The
big tree has now collapsed
completely.
Ivy carpets the roadside
bank; otherwise only one
plant seen, and that up a tree.
Roadside bank is
wood-type, [!!!!] of moderate size.
c.3
Pimpinella: [!!!!]one[!!!!] plants
seen in roadside verge, iden-
tified by radical leaves
and old stems.
Coppicing.
Area cut in 1954 has
dense, but slender, crooked
and low, regrowth of all
