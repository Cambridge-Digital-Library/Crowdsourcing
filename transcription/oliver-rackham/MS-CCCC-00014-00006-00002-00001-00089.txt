20 June 1965
Rhinanthus
minor s. str. occurs
in a single patch
along the roadside
about 1/4 mile W. of Granoden
Lodge, on the S. side
Cockayne Hatley Wood
This was penetrated
for about 100 yards in from the 
road bounding it on the 
W.
Young hazel coppice, with
large sto[????]l ashes, rather dark
probably owing to fairly 
recent coppicing. Not many
big oaks. Acer campestre
and Populus tremula abundant
One oak seedling of this
year was found.

[7226-7227]

Ajuda reptans

in the daytime onthe concrete
surround of the Leckhampton 
swimming pool
June 23 
Rhinanthus occurs on 
railway banks about a 
mile W. of Hayley Wood.
Broom occurs in railway banks in the cutting S. of 
Gamlingay
Senecio squalidus is 
the first plant which meets
the traveller leaving Oxford
railway station
Ceterach on railway platform at Verney Junction, Addington, Bucks NGS

Anthenius cotula is abun-
dant in a cornfield at 308826,
adjoining South Elmham
Minster Grove
The roadside elms still

[7228-7229]

form a thick tall close
hedge on the N. side of the
Low Road, Shotford 240822
June 26
The ducks left the College 
about now
June 27
Barley field at Fulbourne 
(508561)
Sinapis arvenois ext. ab.
Lapsana communis ext. ab.
Pease field at Fulbourne
(538538)
Papaver rhoeas: ab. 
P. hybridum: r. ab; distin-
guished from P. rhoeas by
the deep pink petals.*
Fagopyrum
Orobanche elatior: two spikes, 
one 3ft from the nearest
*Also ab. at eyes of fields near Dotterell Hall, 545334
Centaurea scabiosa (in hedge)
Asparagus officialis: estab-
lished in hedge. NGS.
Balsham Pit 574512
The bottom of the pit
has been partly turned into
a sewage farm. Here occurs
Fumaria parviflora parviflora,
Delphinium sp. (on side of pit
towards Balsham), and Fagopy-
rum. Sedum acre occurs 
on day chalky ground on
the lip of the pit.
One plant of Orobanche
elatior was found in a fragment of chalk grass-
land on the lip of the pit
In Balsham village is a
fine Cyprus cedar, badly

[7230-7231]

damaged by frost.
There is a bees' nest 
in the space between the
top of the wall and the
roof boards in the chancel
of Balsham church. Although
small, this contains a large
hive.
In West Wickham church-
yard is an ancient yew
some 3ft diam., with many
old dead branches at the
top. The present branches 
are vigorous and overtop the
dead ones. The trunk bears
many closely packed epi-
cormics.
Lopham's Wood, Carlton,
is a boulder-clay wood with
most of the standards felled.
Wood at Carlton, by the 383
spot-height in the S. of the
parish, 649512.
A small triangular copse,
seemingly fairly recent,
with no distinction into
storeys. Much hornbeam,
formerly coppiced. Birch co-
dominant. Poplar and elm
abundant.
There are about 6 plants
of Primula elatior.
A small patch of Trifolium
ochroleucon occurs beside
the Carlton Green-Little Thur-
lar road at 646513 NGS.
Near Little Bradley Hall,
W. Suffolk, are some hedge
maples fully as large as
oaks, which they much re-

[7232-7233]

semble in habit.
Hedgehogs were seen doing
mating display in a ploughed
field near the Devil's Ditch,
Wood Dutton, at about an
hour after sunset. One
made a curious snuffling
noise, puffing like a steam
locomotive, which attracted
one's attention when cycling
past. The same sound was
heard at other places in
the Wood Ditton area. Two
animals could be made
out in the dim light, about
6ft apart; there may
have been a third. They
moved only slowly or not
at all
June 28
There are still very few
small ducks on the river
June 29
Hayley Wood
Lepidozia reptans was
discovered by Stephen Waters
on the future 1965-6
coppicing plot. On revisiting
the site, Tetraphis was
found. Lepidozia is new to 
Cambs; Tetraphis new to the
wood and 4th Cambs record.
Either or both were found
on a large oak stump
and four trees within a 
few yards. Lepidozia
was also found on
an oak stump between 
this site and the 1964-5
plot; it probably occurs

[7234-7235]

[DIAG]

[7236-7237]

on other trees as well.
They grow together, forming
big patches to the exclusion
of other bryophytes. Tetraphis
tends to favour vertical
surfaces. They almost entirely
cover the big stump and
large areas of the other
sites. There is no evidence
that they prefer particular
aspect. They do not
go more than c. 1 1/2ft
above the ground. This
is a dark part of the
wood, but not conspiciously
so. One plant of Dryopteris
dilatata, and numerous
prothalli among the Lepidozia,
are the only other plants
on the big stump.
1. Chlorociboria aeruginascens.
Fruiting abundantly on a 
very rotten green-stained
branch a few yards from
the main Lepidozia-Tetraphis
site. Apothecia trumpet-
shaped, characteristically
brilliant glaucous green.
2. Pleurotus sapidus (cornu-
copioides) Abundant on the 
top of one of the great
elm logs by the Triangle.
Owing to their position, the
sporophores have central stripes
Ruosula ocholeuca. One
poor one in the Triangle.
There is a hole near

[7238-7239]

the rotten elms in the 
Triangle, probably the work
of rabbits. Around the 
next oak to Lloyd's oak
(1965 plot) there is a wide
zone of scratched and dis-
turbed ground, with a few
rabbit pellets.
Sonchus asper has ap-
peared on the 1964 coppiced
area.
June 30
Heracleum mantegarz-
zianum is flowering in
the loke and on the reser-
ved ground at Leckhampton.
July 1
Two hedgehogs were 
seen about 3ft apart
at the S. end of Leck-
hampton croquet lawn soon
after dusk; one of them was 
making the curious puffing 
noise.
July 2 
The horsechestnut in
front of the Master's Lodge
at Pembroke, from which a
largebranch split off on
June 18, was grubbed up.
Diam. 2 1/2 - 3ft. About 55
years old. Rings uniformly 
very wide (max. width 1/2 in.)
in the last 40 years. This 
tree had a tangled mass 
of small rots within 1 1/2 ft
of the surface, very few
roots below, and no tap
root. 3 men took 1 1/2 days
with pick and axe to cut

[7240-7241]

through most of the roots.
A 3/4 in. diam. steel cable
was then fastened round
the trunk about 12ft up
and pulled by a lorry
until it broke, without
moving the tree, and further
ecavation was needed
before it could be over-
turned. A fork higher than
the one which broke was
found to have a similar
included pocket of bark
July 3
The third of the sick
horse-chestnuts in Leckhamp-
ton (on the garden side of 
the avenue, near the far
end) has many dead
twigs and small branches at
the top, and others with small
leaves, but shows little sign
of progressive die-back
July 4 
Papaver lecoqii occurs
in a farmyard at Goldstones,
Ashdon, N. Essex. Petals dis-
tinctly more orange than
in P. rhoeas OGS?
Papaver rhoeas occurs
apparently exclusively in
the fallow at Babraham,
and along the high road
from Hildersham to Linton.
Fumaria spp no longer
occur in fields alongthe high roads below Hildersham
Furze Hills
Trifolium ochroleucon
was found several times

[7242-7243]

in N.W.Essex:
Ashdon, roadside 507406
Radwinter, roadside, 624396
Radwinter, verge of green lane,
626404
Conium is very abundant
along the road from Linton to
Bartlow, and on certain other
roadsides
Great and Little Bendysh Woods, 
Radwinter
Formerly coppice with stan-
dards. The standards have
been felled from most of
the woods. Some, such as
the S. E. corner of great
Bendysh Wood, has been
felled completely and plan-
ted with pine; elsewhere,
pine and spruce have been
planted under the stool-ashes.
The latter have recently
been rudely ringed with
axe cuts, which cause some
of them to die. This seems
a dubious method of silvi-
culture in sites where Armil-
laria is doubtless abundant.
July 5
Two small plants of 
Heracleum mantegazzianum
are successfully flowering
in Leckhampton Loke.
July 6
Lonicera belgica has just
done flowering at Leckhampton
July 7
Squeakers are not very

[7244-7245]

many this year
July 8
The sempervivum arach-
noideum marked "prob. Hoher
Lehner", which has now in-
creased to 18 rosettes, has
produced a terminal infl. from
one of them. It has 6 fls
each of ap- [DIAG]
proximately 
Kn Cn
A2n Gn
where 
n = 6 to 9
Corolla 
bright rose pink
with a darker midrib. Scape
with its leaves and calyx
densely glandular. Fls
normal arachnoideum size.
July 9
One of the two main
trunks of the ancient elm
in the bus station is quite
dead
July 10
Little Gidding
The pond near the church
is full of Zannichellia pal-
ustris NGS
There are some large
old box trees in the church-
yard, and a big one in
the field outside.
There is a curious
very hollow elm in the field
outside
Around Great Stakeley
there are several oaks
dying at the top. Several
