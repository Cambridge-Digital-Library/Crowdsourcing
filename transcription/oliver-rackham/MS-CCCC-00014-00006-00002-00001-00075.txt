the tree is reduce by about 2ft.
The roses are very good this year but suffer some-what from mildew.

Polypo[????] squamosus is fruiting abundantly on a big elm stump in Grange Road. There are about 20 sporoph[????]res up to 2ft diam.
June 2[????] [DIAG]
There was a sudden thunderstorm with heavy rain and a brilliant largely single rainbow, with well-marked inner fringes, over the old court about 8 p.m.
[6044-6045]

A duck with six smll ducklings was seen in Jesus Ditch, and one with one small duckling in Trinity Hall backs.
June 27.
The defunct College bay tree shows 34-38 annual rings some of the suckers are still alive, but without growing.
June 28.
The large fig tree in St Edward's churchyard shows no sign of life. The smaller but fairly old one on the wall of the Old Court in the Tutor's garden put forth some very small and late leaves, but has now been cut down.
June 29.
There has been very heavy rain today and yesterday.
June 30.
There is a fine stand of Onopordon, up to 6ft high, on the roadside at Chalk Hills, Sawston (481504) and a smaller stand opposite Pampisford station (519487).
A Taxodium was planted with other trees in a patch of scrub opposite the gates of Pampisford Hall, but after reaching about 40ft is now now dead.
Cardu[????] crispus occurs by the roadside in the

[6046-6047]
same place.
Malva sylvest[????], growing in a dense pig-[????] at Pampisford, has not been touched.
Amisantha gussonii grows at Pampisford Hall. New grid-square record.
July 1
The fig tree in St Edward's churchyard has some very late and small shoots, scattered over the upper branches; this sug-gests that the trunk has been damaged.
July 2
The Leckhampton wi-staria has now produced almost the full number of shoots, though none is flowering. There is no sign of life in the smaller Wistaria.
July 3
A great storm, with thunder and heavy rain.
July 4
A great thunderstorm with intense lightning and very heavy rain. One very loud explosion shook windows. It was probably that which damaged buildings in King's Hedges Road.
July 5
A medium-sized bat was found in a little-used attic with a small open window in

[6048-6049]
Leckhampton. When the light was switched on a-bout 8.30 p.m., it flew up and down. There was much dung near the window. A large mass of hay in the next attic resembles a great bird's nest; it is situated just under the window, but the louvres would not admit a very large bird.
July 6.
There was heavy rain all the afternoon.
