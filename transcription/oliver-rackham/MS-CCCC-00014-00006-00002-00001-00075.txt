the tree is reduce by about 2ft.
The roses are very good this year but suffer some-what from mildew.
June 24.
Polypo[????] squamosus is fruiting abundantly on a big elm stump in Grange Road. There are about 20 sporoph[????]res up to 2ft diam.
June 2[????] [DIAG]
There was a sudden thunderstorm with heavy rain and a brilliant largely single rainbow, with well-marked inner fringes, over the old court about 8 p.m.
[6044-6045]
June 26.
A duck with six smll ducklings was seen in Jesus Ditch, and one with one small duckling in Trinity Hall backs.
June 27.
The defunct College bay tree shows 34-38 annual rings some of the suckers are still alive, but without growing.
June 28.
The large fig tree in St Edward's churchyard shows no sign of life. The smaller but fairly old one on the wall of the Old Court in the Tutor's garden put forth some very small and late leaves, but has now been cut down.
June 29.
There has been very heavy rain today and yesterday.
June 30.
There is a fine stand of Onopordon, up to 6ft high, on the roadside at Chalk Hills, Sawston (481504) and a smaller stand opposite Pampisford station (519487).
A Taxodium was planted with other trees in a patch of scrub opposite the gates of Pampisford Hall, but after reaching about 40ft is now now dead.
Cardu[????] crispus occurs by the roadside in the

[6046-6047]
same place.
Malva sylvest[????], growing in a dense pig-[????] at Pampisford, has not been touched.
Amisantha gussonii grows at Pampisford Hall. New grid-square record.
July 1
The fig tree in St Edward's churchyard has some very late and small shoots, scattered over the upper branches; this sug-gests that the trunk has been damaged.
July 2
The Leckhampton wi-staria has now produced almost the full number of shoots, though none is flowering. There is no sign of life in the smaller Wistaria.
July 3
A great storm, with thunder and heavy rain.
July 4
A great thunderstorm with intense lightning and very heavy rain. One very loud explosion shook windows. It was probably that which damaged buildings in King's Hedges Road.
July 5
A medium-sized bat was found in a little-used attic with a small open window in

[6048-6049]
Leckhampton. When the light was switched on a-bout 8.30 p.m., it flew up and down. There was much dung near the window. A large mass of hay in the next attic resembles a great bird's nest; it is situated just under the window, but the louvres would not admit a very large bird.
July 6.
There was heavy rain all the afternoon.

Cladium forms dense
stands in wet open fen
(several inches of surface 
water now, after much 
rain) between the Jerusalem
woods and in the Poor's fen.
CHIPPENHAM FEN [DIAG]

[6058-6059]
Menyanthes and serratula
are local between the 
main drove and New Plan-
tation.
Calamagrostis epigeios
forms several small st[????]ds
in the N. corner of the
Poor's fen and the E. end
of the N. Moorwiefe, with the
water table just at the
surface. The different clonal
patches vary strikingly in 
flowering time.
Lithospermum ar[????]
grows near the spring area.
Several hares were
seen: one running about in
the cultivated grounds of
snailwell; four at the S.
of the 40 Acre Wood. In
the latter case, the first
popped out of the under-
growth by a cut drove at
about 20 ft away and
approached at full speed;
not until c.10ft away
did it turn aside some-
what leisurely. It was fol-
lowed by three others which
came out about 15ft away
and made off unhurriedly
down the drove.
Rosa rubiginosa is
scattered over the fen. The
glands have a glorious 
rich scent of stewed apples.
An Iris fl. was found
with the normal tri[????]culae
ovary but one extra style.
187: Brachythecium sp.,

[6060-6061]
dark woodland floor, New
Plantation. B. rutabulum,
salebrosum, or mildeanum.
July 8.
Roots from the horse-
chestnut tree in the
small court between
Biochemistry, Agriculture, and
Botany have been ex-
posed copiously in sewer-
age trenches up to
50 ft away from the
trunk, well outside the
canopy. The soil is here
about 8 ft of much
disturbed earth resting
on sand.
July 9
There is much de-
foliation of elms, es-
pecially U. carpinifolia
and I. glabra, in many
parts of the county. the
short shoots are most
affected, and some trees
in West Road show [????]
on the long shoots only.
The WS are never wi-
thered but sometimes partly removed, sug-
gesting caterpillars as
the agent.
July 10.
There is not much
evidence of Dutch elm
disease in Cambridge. 
[!!!!] Some small branches of 
the ancient elm in the 
bus station are affected.

[6062-6063]
July 11.
Lilium martagon [????]
grows abundantly in St
John's wilderness: There
are hundreds of plants
up to 4ft high with many
large fls[????] (much better 
than is usual in the
Alps). The sweetish fra-
grance of dead rats rea-
ches to Queens' Road.
July 12.
A sycamore in John's Wilderness is unhealthy
and dying back, espe-
cially at the top.
July 12.
Trifolium och[????]leucon
occurs in small quantity
by the roadside at the
point marked 173 in Steeple
Gidding.
Zannichellia grows in 
the small isolated pond
by the church in Little
Gidding.
Card[????] crispus is
very abundant in the 
Giddings and Sawtry, being
a serious arable weed. It
forms an avenue 6ft high
along the road by Cold-
harbour Farm.
In Steeple Gidding,
barley growing on a ridge-
-and-furrow system is
badly lodged in the furrows
but stands on the ridges.
Several hares were 
seen in the Giddings, in-

[6064-6065]
cluding one intending sui-
cide which raced along the
road for about 1/4 mile in
front of a car. The corpse
of another was found on
the road.
[!!!!] There was a violent
thunderstorm with lightning
and heavy rain near lit-
tle Gidding.
July 14.
Chamaecyparis spp at
the Botanic Garden are
slow to recover from frost
damage, and severely da-
maged trees show no sign
of growth though still alive.
July 15.
Fox-hole Heath
[????] abundant in
rye field opposite the [????] 
Cynoglosum ibid.
Lycopsis ab. barley field
Medicago hybrids, roadside
verge.
Heather on the rabbit
warren is slow to recover

Cirsium acaule. A form
occurs by the road junction,
738774, with several erect
stems to 20 cm high, each
with 1-4 [SYMBOL] sessile heads.
Medicago minima. Edge
of an abandoned field.
Lycopsis arvensis. adbun-
dant in abandoned
field.

[6066-6067]
1. Boletus bov[????]: a few
under pines, Fox-hole
Heath. Also on Laken-
heath Warren, by colon-
izing pines c. 6ft high
near Lakenheath Lodge.
scarce among pines on N. edge of Lakenheath
Warren; most frequent in
grass just outside the
canopy.
2. Marasmius epiphyllus.
Once seen on pine needles,
Wangford Warren.
3. Lycoperdon cadatum.
several, mostly old but
a few young, in various
parts of Lakenheath Warren.
Grouped, but not in de-
finite rings.
Lakenheath Warren
Carex ericetorum (?): patch
c. 15 in diam. grassland A
going off in the middle and
being colonized by Hieracium
pilosella.
Botrychium; a few in-
tact fronds and nume-
rous petioles in the less
intensely rabbit-grazed
parts of Grassland A. Not
found in more intensely 
grazed parts. Extremely nu-
merous and well-developed
fronds in the enclosure
Anti[????] onotium:
abandoned field S. of the
warren.
Vulpua bromides ibid.
Botrychium is ex-

[6068-6069]
tremely palatable to rabbits
("a kind of super-asparagus
Dr Coombe). It grows 
rather abundantly outside
the Grassland A enclosure,
but all the fronds are
ripped off. Several have
come up inside the wire
cage, c.1ft diam., around
the silene stites plant just
outside the enclosure.
The warren on Fox-
hole Heath is actively
occupied. Three rabbits
were seen there in 
broad daylight in the course
of a few minutes. One
was sitting at the mouth
of a hole into which it
disappeared when it had
been approached by crawling to 15ft away. Another, when
started, passed by several 
open holes and made off
into the plain. Many holes
have been enlarged and
the characteristic "rabbit-
-proof" plants have mostly
disappeared, either by digging
up or by burying, as a 
consequence.
This heath is closely
intersected with hare
tracks.
The warren is closely
intersected with shallow [????]
[????] in blown sand, about
3 in. deep. The surface
is heaved up along the
[????] and the dead

[6070-6071]
Polytrichum juniperinum,
which is the chief surface
vegetation, has been dis-
lodged. There are occasional
exit holes to the surface.
Underground mouse [????]
are also frequent.
A plant of Cirsium
vulgare with one slightly
fasciated head was found
on Lakenheath warren.
The upper leaves of Lyc-
opsis are frequently palmate
and amplexicaul, as if
they were three or four
fused [????] leaves.
189: Grassland A, 
Lakenheath Warren.
190: Anlacomnium palustre,
frequent in the S. part of
[DIAG] Lycopsis arvensis
[DIAG]
Wangford Warren, 779806
Forms of Dicranum
scopanium which tend to
D. rugosum are frequent

[6072-6073]
on the S. border of Wang-
ford Warren. The undu-
late WS, tomentum, and
apical tuft are represen-
ted, but not the large
size.
[DIAG] Lakenheath
Eriswell
78
The heather stripes on
Eriswell High Warren are on
part of the largest remaining
patch of heathland. They
occur on a long W.
facing slope and to some
extent on a S. facing slope
as well. The heather is
in narrow strips with Galium
verum. The interstices are
tall Festuca spp and Aven[????].
The wavelength is about 
16ft. The strips are very
regular on the slope. On
the plateau, they disappear
into irregular patches
and bands of heather.
On the edge of the pla-
teau, anastomoses are fre-
quent, and there [DIAG]
is one beautifully
formed arch of
heather connecting two
strips round the head of
a third.
Botrychium has a
faint juicy rather non-

[6074-6075]
descript flavour (cf asparagus).
Nine hare tracks
converge on a gap in the
rabbit-fence between La-
kenheath and Eriswell
warrens, and there is a large semicircular
gap in the barley crop
on the Eriswell side.
Filipendula hexapetala
occurs abundantly in
heathland at the far end
of Lakenheath Warren.
A dense stand of
broom c. 6ft high in the 
N.E. corner of Eriswell is
largely dead, killed by frost, 
as shown by surviving
branches in the interior
of bushes.
A light fasciation 
was seen in a single head
of Cirsium vulgare, Laken-
heath.
Several red squirrels
were seen in Wangford.
July 16.
A few bats have been
seen in Leckhampton.
July 17
The Ceanothus in the 
Old Court is completely
recovered from the winter.
July 18
Neither the bay-tree
in College nor that at
Leckhampton shows any
sign of life.
July 19
Inocybe fastigiata is

[6076-6077]
abundant in grass along
the E. edge of Hardwick
Wood. Spores guttiform, [????].
Inula Helenium occurs
about 100 yards N.W. of
Wood Farm, Hardwick, by
the track.
The following plants
are much reduced this
year and hard to find
in the fields on the
way to Hardwick Wood,
though sometimes present
on the track:
Kickxia elatine & K. spuria
Papaver spp
Sison amornum
Papunculus arvensis
scandix pecten [SYMBOL]
July 20
The second suspicious
horse-chestnut in Leckhamp-
ton is more suspicious than
ever, with very small leaves
in the crown.
July 21
Orobanche spp are
frequent in Hinxton and
Great Chesterford, as follows.
(1) A single clump of 5
O. elat[????], of very different
ages, on Centaurea scabissa
on a broad roadside verge
S. of Hinxton Grange entrance,
496460 (E. of road). One
was picked. The site is
being road-widended.
(2) Several O. [????]
([????][????] of various ages,

[6078-6079]
some possibly from last
year) on both sides of the
road from Stump Cross to
Great Chesterford. One plant
2ft from the nearest 
Centaurea.
(3) O. minor, very luxuriant
on Trifolium pratense on
a rubble tip on the E.
side of the same road,
about halfway along.
At least 12 infls.
Scirpus lacustris,
Ranunculus aquatilis ssp
, and sparganium
ramosum occur in the
Cam at Ickleton.
The beech stump at
Little Shelford is very
decayed, much of the
squamosus areas having
disappeared altogether. The
Ganoderma sporophore has
laid down some more tubes.
July 22.
A large willow (S. frag [????])
has been dead some months
at the N.W. of the junction
of Bin Brook and Grange Road, on the banks of the
beck.
July 23
A considerable outbreak
of dry rot has been found in the top storey
of the College, on the
street side directly above
the Porters' Lodge. It covers
the outer walls of the
two small rooms on

[6080-6081]
this floor. There are
two ornate windows
each of two large
lights and four small
ones at the top, the
latter being boarded up.
On the inside, the 
window case only in-
cludes the two big lights.
The lintels (about
6"x6") of the insides of both windows are 
half rotted through, and
the cases partly de-
stroyed. The plaster of 
the wall and the
woodwork it rest on
have also been removed.
This part of the New
Court has its original
roof, no attics having been 
added. This rests on
the top of the outer
walls behind the para-
pet. The sole plate is
destroyed and some of
the principals of the roof
are attacked at their
ends. some bonding
courses in the wall
have also been destroyed.
No floor seems to be
endangered, though the 
ceiling joists have been
rotted at their ends.
The rot is typically
[????], with abundant 
felty surface mycellum
and brown stringy
strands over the brickwork
