the tree is reduce by about 2ft.
The roses are very good this year but suffer some-what from mildew.
June 24.
Polypo[????] squamosus is fruiting abundantly on a big elm stump in Grange Road. There are about 20 sporoph[????]res up to 2ft diam.
June 2[????] [DIAG]
There was a sudden thunderstorm with heavy rain and a brilliant largely single rainbow, with well-marked inner fringes, over the old court about 8 p.m.
[6044-6045]
June 26.
A duck with six smll ducklings was seen in Jesus Ditch, and one with one small duckling in Trinity Hall backs.
June 27.
The defunct College bay tree shows 34-38 annual rings some of the suckers are still alive, but without growing.
June 28.
The large fig tree in St Edward's churchyard shows no sign of life. The smaller but fairly old one on the wall of the Old Court in the Tutor's garden put forth some very small and late leaves, but has now been cut down.
June 29.
There has been very heavy rain today and yesterday.
June 30.
There is a fine stand of Onopordon, up to 6ft high, on the roadside at Chalk Hills, Sawston (481504) and a smaller stand opposite Pampisford station (519487).
A Taxodium was planted with other trees in a patch of scrub opposite the gates of Pampisford Hall, but after reaching about 40ft is now now dead.
Cardu[????] crispus occurs by the roadside in the

[6046-6047]
same place.
Malva sylvest[????], growing in a dense pig-[????] at Pampisford, has not been touched.
Amisantha gussonii grows at Pampisford Hall. New grid-square record.
July 1
The fig tree in St Edward's churchyard has some very late and small shoots, scattered over the upper branches; this sug-gests that the trunk has been damaged.
July 2
The Leckhampton wi-staria has now produced almost the full number of shoots, though none is flowering. There is no sign of life in the smaller Wistaria.
July 3
A great storm, with thunder and heavy rain.
July 4
A great thunderstorm with intense lightning and very heavy rain. One very loud explosion shook windows. It was probably that which damaged buildings in King's Hedges Road.
July 5
A medium-sized bat was found in a little-used attic with a small open window in

[6048-6049]
Leckhampton. When the light was switched on a-bout 8.30 p.m., it flew up and down. There was much dung near the window. A large mass of hay in the next attic resembles a great bird's nest; it is situated just under the window, but the louvres would not admit a very large bird.
July 6.
There was heavy rain all the afternoon.

Cladium forms dense
stands in wet open fen
(several inches of surface 
water now, after much 
rain) between the Jerusalem
woods and in the Poor's fen.
CHIPPENHAM FEN [DIAG]

[6058-6059]
Menyanthes and serratula
are local between the 
main drove and New Plan-
tation.
Calamagrostis epigeios
forms several small st[????]ds
in the N. corner of the
Poor's fen and the E. end
of the N. Moorwiefe, with the
water table just at the
surface. The different clonal
patches vary strikingly in 
flowering time.
Lithospermum ar[????]
grows near the spring area.
Several hares were
seen: one running about in
the cultivated grounds of
snailwell; four at the S.
of the 40 Acre Wood. In
the latter case, the first
popped out of the under-
growth by a cut drove at
about 20 ft away and
approached at full speed;
not until c.10ft away
did it turn aside some-
what leisurely. It was fol-
lowed by three others which
came out about 15ft away
and made off unhurriedly
down the drove.
Rosa rubiginosa is
scattered over the fen. The
glands have a glorious 
rich scent of stewed apples.
An Iris fl. was found
with the normal tri[????]culae
ovary but one extra style.
187: Brachythecium sp.,

[6060-6061]
dark woodland floor, New
Plantation. B. rutabulum,
salebrosum, or mildeanum.
July 8.
Roots from the horse-
chestnut tree in the
small court between
Biochemistry, Agriculture, and
Botany have been ex-
posed copiously in sewer-
age trenches up to
50 ft away from the
trunk, well outside the
canopy. The soil is here
about 8 ft of much
disturbed earth resting
on sand.
July 9
There is much de-
foliation of elms, es-
pecially U. carpinifolia
and I. glabra, in many
parts of the county. the
short shoots are most
affected, and some trees
in West Road show [????]
on the long shoots only.
The WS are never wi-
thered but sometimes partly removed, sug-
gesting caterpillars as
the agent.
July 10.
There is not much
evidence of Dutch elm
disease in Cambridge. 
[!!!!] Some small branches of 
the ancient elm in the 
bus station are affected.

[6062-6063]
July 11.
Lilium martagon [????]
grows abundantly in St
John's wilderness: There
are hundreds of plants
up to 4ft high with many
large fls[????] (much better 
than is usual in the
Alps). The sweetish fra-
grance of dead rats rea-
ches to Queens' Road.
July 12.
A sycamore in John's Wilderness is unhealthy
and dying back, espe-
cially at the top.
July 12.
Trifolium och[????]leucon
occurs in small quantity
by the roadside at the
point marked 173 in Steeple
Gidding.
Zannichellia grows in 
the small isolated pond
by the church in Little
Gidding.
Card[????] crispus is
very abundant in the 
Giddings and Sawtry, being
a serious arable weed. It
forms an avenue 6ft high
along the road by Cold-
harbour Farm.
In Steeple Gidding,
barley growing on a ridge-
-and-furrow system is
badly lodged in the furrows
but stands on the ridges.
Several hares were 
seen in the Giddings, in-

[6064-6065]
cluding one intending sui-
cide which raced along the
road for about 1/4 mile in
front of a car. The corpse
of another was found on
the road.
[!!!!] There was a violent
thunderstorm with lightning
and heavy rain near lit-
tle Gidding.
July 14.
Chamaecyparis spp at
the Botanic Garden are
slow to recover from frost
damage, and severely da-
maged trees show no sign
of growth though still alive.
July 15.

rye field opposite the [????] 
Cynoglosum ibid.
Lycopsis ab. barley field
Medicago hybrids, roadside
verge.
Heather on the rabbit
warren is slow to recover

scarce among pines on N. edge of Lakenheath
Warren; most frequent in
grass just outside the
canopy.
2. Marasmius epiphyllus.
Once seen on pine needles,
Wangford Warren.
3. Lycoperdon cadatum.
several, mostly old but
a few young, in various
parts of Lakenheath Warren.

finite rings.
Lakenheath Warren
Carex ericetorum (?): patch
c. 15 in diam. grassland A
going off in the middle and
being colonized by Hieracium
pilosella.
Botrychium; a few in-
tact fronds and nume-
rous petioles in the less
intensely rabbit-grazed
parts of Grassland A. Not
found in more intensely 
grazed parts. Extremely nu-
merous and well-developed
fronds in the enclosure
Anti[????] onotium:
abandoned field S. of the
warren.
Vulpua bromides ibid.
Botrychium is ex-

[6068-6069]
tremely palatable to rabbits
("a kind of super-asparagus
Dr Coombe). It grows 
rather abundantly outside
the Grassland A enclosure,
but all the fronds are
ripped off. Several have
come up inside the wire
cage, c.1ft diam., around
the silene stites plant just
outside the enclosure.
The warren on Fox-
hole Heath is actively
occupied. Three rabbits
were seen there in 
broad daylight in the course
of a few minutes. One
was sitting at the mouth
of a hole into which it
disappeared when it had
been approached by crawling to 15ft away. Another, when
started, passed by several 
open holes and made off
into the plain. Many holes
have been enlarged and
the characteristic "rabbit-
-proof" plants have mostly
disappeared, either by digging
up or by burying, as a 
consequence.
This heath is closely
intersected with hare
tracks.
The warren is closely
intersected with shallow [????]
[????] in blown sand, about
3 in. deep. The surface
is heaved up along the
[????] and the dead

[6070-6071]
Polytrichum juniperinum,
which is the chief surface
vegetation, has been dis-
lodged. There are occasional
exit holes to the surface.
Underground mouse [????]
are also frequent.
A plant of Cirsium
vulgare with one slightly
fasciated head was found
on Lakenheath warren.
The upper leaves of Lyc-
opsis are frequently palmate
and amplexicaul, as if
they were three or four
fused [????] leaves.

Lakenheath Warren.
190: Anlacomnium palustre,
frequent in the S. part of
[DIAG] Lycopsis arvensis
[DIAG]
Wangford Warren, 779806
Forms of Dicranum
scopanium which tend to
D. rugosum are frequent

[6072-6073]
on the S. border of Wang-
ford Warren. The undu-
late WS, tomentum, and
apical tuft are represen-
ted, but not the large
size.
[DIAG] Lakenheath
Eriswell
78
The heather stripes on
Eriswell High Warren are on
part of the largest remaining
patch of heathland. They
occur on a long W.
facing slope and to some
extent on a S. facing slope
as well. The heather is
in narrow strips with Galium
verum. The interstices are
tall Festuca spp and Aven[????].
The wavelength is about 
16ft. The strips are very
regular on the slope. On
the plateau, they disappear
into irregular patches
and bands of heather.
On the edge of the pla-
teau, anastomoses are fre-
quent, and there [DIAG]
is one beautifully
formed arch of
heather connecting two
strips round the head of
a third.
Botrychium has a
faint juicy rather non-

[6074-6075]
descript flavour (cf asparagus).
Nine hare tracks
converge on a gap in the
rabbit-fence between La-
kenheath and Eriswell
warrens, and there is a large semicircular
gap in the barley crop
on the Eriswell side.
Filipendula hexapetala
occurs abundantly in
heathland at the far end
of Lakenheath Warren.
A dense stand of
broom c. 6ft high in the 
N.E. corner of Eriswell is
largely dead, killed by frost, 
as shown by surviving
branches in the interior
of bushes.
A light fasciation 
was seen in a single head
of Cirsium vulgare, Laken-
heath.
Several red squirrels
were seen in Wangford.
July 16.
A few bats have been
seen in Leckhampton.
July 17
The Ceanothus in the 
Old Court is completely
recovered from the winter.
July 18
Neither the bay-tree
in College nor that at
Leckhampton shows any
sign of life.
July 19
Inocybe fastigiata is

[6076-6077]
abundant in grass along
the E. edge of Hardwick
Wood. Spores guttiform, [????].
Inula Helenium occurs
about 100 yards N.W. of
Wood Farm, Hardwick, by
the track.
The following plants
are much reduced this
year and hard to find
in the fields on the
way to Hardwick Wood,
though sometimes present
on the track:
Kickxia elatine & K. spuria
Papaver spp
Sison amornum
Papunculus arvensis
scandix pecten [SYMBOL]
July 20
The second suspicious
horse-chestnut in Leckhamp-
ton is more suspicious than
ever, with very small leaves
in the crown.
July 21
Orobanche spp are
frequent in Hinxton and
Great Chesterford, as follows.
(1) A single clump of 5
O. elat[????], of very different
ages, on Centaurea scabissa
on a broad roadside verge
S. of Hinxton Grange entrance,
496460 (E. of road). One
was picked. The site is
being road-widended.
(2) Several O. [????]
([????][????] of various ages,

[6078-6079]
some possibly from last
year) on both sides of the
road from Stump Cross to
Great Chesterford. One plant
2ft from the nearest 
Centaurea.
(3) O. minor, very luxuriant
on Trifolium pratense on
a rubble tip on the E.
side of the same road,
about halfway along.
At least 12 infls.
Scirpus lacustris,
Ranunculus aquatilis ssp
, and sparganium
ramosum occur in the
Cam at Ickleton.
The beech stump at
Little Shelford is very
decayed, much of the
squamosus areas having
disappeared altogether. The
Ganoderma sporophore has
laid down some more tubes.
July 22.
A large willow (S. frag [????])
has been dead some months
at the N.W. of the junction
of Bin Brook and Grange Road, on the banks of the
beck.
July 23
A considerable outbreak
of dry rot has been found in the top storey
of the College, on the
street side directly above
the Porters' Lodge. It covers
the outer walls of the
two small rooms on

[6080-6081]
this floor. There are
two ornate windows
each of two large
lights and four small
ones at the top, the
latter being boarded up.
On the inside, the 
window case only in-
cludes the two big lights.
The lintels (about
6"x6") of the insides of both windows are 
half rotted through, and
the cases partly de-
stroyed. The plaster of 
the wall and the
woodwork it rest on
have also been removed.
This part of the New
Court has its original
roof, no attics having been 
added. This rests on
the top of the outer
walls behind the para-
pet. The sole plate is
destroyed and some of
the principals of the roof
are attacked at their
ends. some bonding
courses in the wall
have also been destroyed.
No floor seems to be
endangered, though the 
ceiling joists have been
rotted at their ends.
The rot is typically
[????], with abundant 
felty surface mycellum
and brown stringy
strands over the brickwork

[6082-6083]
It may have started
in the gyp room, or in 
the boarded-up windows,
or under a leaky gutter.
July 24
Wandlebury.

1. Puccinia taraxaci. Fre-
quent on dandelions.

2. Pluteus cervinus Oc-
casional on rotten elm
and beech.

3. Polyponus giganteus. One
tuft on a beech stump.

4. Stemonitis fusca. Abun-
dant on beech stumps.
The sporocarp is formed
as a white mass of
the same size and
shape as the ripe one,
and ripens without
altering shape.

5. Ustulina. New sporophores
are frequent on beech
stumps. They appear as
a thin resupinate mid
gray crust, margins lighter,
carbonaceous and [????]-
ing when removed,
loosely adherent to the
bark and growing over
algae [????]. The surface
is densely covered with
conidia which can be
blown off as a white dust.
The stroma contains

[6084-6085]
black preformed perithe-
cia whose contents are
gelatinous and show
no sign of asci.

6. Pleurot[????] cornucopiae.
In very large numbers
on two big fallen elm
trunks and an elm
stump on the Ring. The
P. is centrally, excentic-
ally, or marginally
stalked, according to the 
elevatio of the substrate.
None were found resupin-
ate.

7. Auricularia mesenterica.
Abundant on rotten
elm.

8. Xylaria hypoxylon
Scarce, comidial.

9. X. polymorpha. Scarce,

One troop, on an elm
stump.

11. C. micaceus.
In vast numbers, of 
various ages, within c.
6ft all round a large
beech stump in the pan-
handle. Mostly in clusters
on the ground above
buried roots; some at
the base of the stump,
but not far above ground

[6086-6087]
level.

12. C.radiatus. A few
large ones on sundry
beech logs.

12. Diatrype disciformis
Frequent on small dry
beech branches.

14. Oudemansiella radicata.
Frequent in a small
area at the base of
the pan-handle.

15. Calocera viscosa.
Some young ones on 
a rotten conifer log in the
pan-handle.

16. Stereum hirsutum.
On logs in the northern copse.

17. Puccinia [????] 
Æcidia on the Ws of
Tuosilago; uredosori &
teleutoson on the WS &
culms of Poa sp. im-
mediately nearby.

18. Venturia [????]
Abundant in the old kitchen-garden

19. Xylaria carpophila. p.6095.
July 25.
Azara macrophylla has
been killed to the
ground by the frost, but
is shooting from the base

[6088-6089]
(Bot. Gard).
July 26.
Dersingham Fen.

1. Boletus scaber. [????] under
birch, one in the middle
of the open fen.

Juncus bulbosus
grows in about 2ft of
clear water in the mud
at the bottom of the [????].
Small sterile tufts 2 1/2m. high.
There is a small area
of iron pan, with sparse
Eriophorum, just N. of
the island of [????] 
on which is the middle
railway gate.
The fen birch woods
in the S. of the fen are
degenerating, perhaps be-
cause the dense ground vegetation hinders seed-
lings. The ground cover
is tall Molinia with
hummocks of Polytrichum
commune (lower levels)
and P. formosum (higher).
There are abundant
small birches (mainly B.
pubescens) in the more
open parts of the fen.
Myrica grows right up
to the edge of the fen in the N.
[!!!!] July 27.
The Calystegia in the
S. back border is C.Xlucara,
agreeing with the descrip-
tion in [????] and inter-
mediate between C. sepium

[6090-6091]
and C. sylvestris.
Mildew is abundant
on the roses, though this
is generally a poor year 
for it.
The small cypress in the
front did not recover from the
frost and has been remov-
ed.

A curious mutant has
a tendancy to the partial or
complete suppression of one
of the corolla lobes, the
upper in some flowers,
the lower in others. Some
are almost normal,
some have an extra
small upper calyx-lope.
In extreme cases, the
corolla is widely split
to the base down one
side.
All the foxgloves
are otherwise deep to
rather pale pink, with 
numerous halved spots.
The [!!!!]row of tall Cu-
pressus macrocarpa in
the garden of No. 68 is

size downwards, but
the largest are not
full-sized. There is a
noticeable gap in the canopy
of the avenue.

The great cedars at Bayfordbury have with-
stood the winter well.
August 1.
Green and black aphids
have been very abundant
in the hot dry weather.
The green have been

Calystegia soldanella
ascends when growing
among tall vegetation, but
makes no attempt [????].
Bryomia is rather abun-
dant on open dunes at

weak though it flowers well.
Toads are abundant
on the dunes and marshes.
Several plants of Verbascum
pulverulentum were seen in
Heacham and Snettisham.
August 3.
In vast numbers in 
the inner filmy-fern house,
Botanic Gardens, on peat
mixed with soil. Temperature
and humidity very high.
3/4-3-3/6 (top).
P. at first barrel-shaped
(of Coprinus comatus),
then nearly flat. Ground
colour bright lemon-yel-
low, solid in the middle
of the P. but breaking up
into ridges at the margin,
which is deeply striate
between the gills with
whitish paper-thin tissue
between the ridges. Central
patch buff. Scales many, 
shaggy (like Coprinus co-
matus but smaller), den-
sest and largest in the
middle but extending right
to the margin along the
ridges, middle ones tipped
with buff.
S. sulphur yellow

[6102-6103]
slightly bulbous below,;
[????] slightly scaly at top and 
base; ring horizontal, fixed,
chartaceous, concolorous, just
above the middle
L. free, thin, not crow-
ded, very pale yellow. Sp. pale gray.
Pin-head primordia
appear in vast numbers, 
the smallest about 1/10
mm diam. These mature
in succession so that 
the sporophores, though
touching, are not unusually
crowded. The develop
into clavate fruit-bodies,
the stipe developing first.
These rapidly expand,
and then suddenly collapse.
The old sporophores
are semi-deliquescent,
running together to form
a sheet over the surface
of the ground, pale brown
with black remains of the
umboes. Many of the later
sporophores are smothered
by this sheet. Up to about
150 sporophores mature
at one time, with thou-
sands of primordia. The
young sporophore is coa-
ted with a yellow eggy
gluten.
Leucocoprinus luteus.[DIAG]

except for a few epicormic
shoots, and one very un-
healthy and dying at the top.
2. Cotoneaster simonsii.
[!!!!] Two bushes have succumbed
to the frost, one after
some early growth (cf
Cupressocyparis). Other,
sheltered by these two,
are recovering.
3. [!!!!]  Colletia armata. Cut
almost to the ground
by frost, but shooting
vigorously. The young twiges
have spathulate thin
leaves.
