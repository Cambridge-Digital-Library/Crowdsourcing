Limits of Trees in Val Badia.
Min Ash c. 2000m
Alnus incana ) 1550m - not quite
Aspen        ) to Corvara
Ash (cultivated) 1750m.
Ash (native) 1000m (Langega -
but rare in the native woods of
lower Gadertal.
Tilia platy.  ) 970m (Neupalfrad)
Polinus avi.  )
Tilia cor. 950m
Oak & beech are absent.
No hawthorn seen.
Hazel 1050m - quite common
in the lower valley.

iime wood.
On S.E. facing side of gorge in
Montal, 850m.
[18058-18059]
  Tilia cor. dominant - mainly
an overgrown coppice stools, c.
3-4ft down, but on rock slopes
so steep that coppicing hardly
seems possible. Much commoner
than platy.
Hazel ab.
Cherry freq.
Spruce ab.
  Very steep ?quartzphyllite rocks.

  In Sonnenburg & St Lorenzen
there are many hedges, chiefly
on old S-facing lynchets,
mainly hazel with some cherry.

Elm and Robinia ascend 
(as planted trees) to Bruneck. 

Maize in lower Pustertal is 
8059
locally severely frosted. No ewvi-
dence of drought.
  Ash is abundant along the
river in lower Pusterthal.
  Black elder ascends to
810m. at Pflaurenz.
  Dogwood ascends to 780m.
at St Sigmund.
  Autumn colours of cherry
are particularly brilliant.
  Hazel and lime leaves are
now mainly yellow.  Most of 
the lime leaves have fallen.
  Many ashes are now largely
leafless.
  Alnus incana remains fgreen
up to its upper limit. Young
twigs seem to have been frosted
earlier in the month.
[18060-18061]
8060
  An Auwald of Alnus
incana poles has been felled
and neatly corded at 
[???? Oberwialt].

The Gaderbach has been
in spate earlier thi syear, prob.
because of melting snow
early in Sept. Msny fringing
alders and other trees have
been uprooted.

  Small patches of lime-wood
on S.facing slope. Nederviatl,
750m. surrounded by Pinus
sylvestris much invaded by
Robinia.
  Highest oaks & chestnuts
appear to be 750m. at
Niederviatl.
8061
  Lime becomes frequent
on the S. aqcing side below
Niederviatl.
  Fraxinus Ornus as far as
Schabs (750m.).

Many hedges & hedge trees
at Neustift bei Brixen.

DED possible at Brixen.

  Lime is frequent as far S.
as Waidbruck.
  A fine covered bridge crosses
the Eisack in one span below
Castelouth.
  The ground beneath the 
motorway in the Eisack gorge,
where it stands on piers,
[18062-18063]
8062
is not wholly vegetated; but
Ostrya and similar vegetation,
surviver unharmed.
 Another covered bridge at
Atzwang; inbtermediate pier of
masonry founded in a huge 
boulder.
  Another covered bridge carries
a motor road at Steg in Vols.
Two concrete piers; very wide
timber middle span.
  Phragmites fens remain
by the Adige above Trent.
  Huge and fairly recent
Bergshirz S. of Castello Pietra
near Rovereto. Cone of house-
sized limestone blocks below
a scar in the cliff.
Pinus nigra is common  in
8063
the Roverto area and as groups of
trees among the sibljak on rocks.
  Elms - mainly small and
Verona-type - are fairly abun-
dant by the railway from Rove-
rto southward. Probably no DED.
  Probably slight DED in one
tree at San Ambrogio.
  Vineyard trees are frequent
between S. Ambrogio and Verona.
Mostly fruit-treew,. generelly kept 
as small pollards, not supporting 
the vines.
  Arundo Donax on the outskirts 
of Verona.
  The [!!!!]Adige has been
about 6 ft above its present high
level. A few vineyards have been
flooded but apparently without
[18064-18065]
8064
harm. All the big rivers between
Verona and Milan are very high,
and have been higher; the
Iseo is now running deep through
the Auwald.
2 October.
Foret de Chantilly
  In the railway cutting, solid
limestone rock is exposed at c.
8-12 ft below the surface.
  Tilia confirmed as abundant,
though probably not dominant, through-
out the stone-quarrying area N. of
Chantilly up yo the river before
Creil.
DED.
Chantilly to Amiens at least
5%.
8065
Amiens 60 - patchy.
Remains at c. 70 for first
half of way to Etaples - then
rapidly diminishes to 10. None till Boulogne
Bou.logne 5% - much new
singeing.
Then none to Calais.
  Near Hesdigneul is a big
wood dominated by ash. No limes
seen. Partly coppiced.
  Many pollard willows & hornbeams
in hedges round Hesdiguel; a few
shredded elms.
