Nowellia is, how-
-ever, not one
of the more
hygrophytic bryophytes, since
it grows mainly on
branches well clear of
the ground. The presence
of Armillaria may well
be important. Most of
the trees concerned
seem to have died about
the same time. Rhizo-
morphs cannot, of course,
be[!!!!] seen in them,
but more recently dead
trees show them under
the bark. Perhaps a
deterioration of drainage
during the agricultural
depression or the war

[5882-5883]
5882
resulted in [????] simultan-
-eous death of many
trees in this wet bottom,
and the rapid fall of
the bark resulting from
Armillaria attack produced
a kind of substratum
suitable for Nowellia. None
of the more recently
killed trees seems to
have reached a state suit-
able for colonization by
Nowellia.
Nowellia does not seem
to have any dispersal
mechanism here.  It does
not usually occur on the
same log with Lophocolea
spp, though these are
abundant on other logs.
5883
The largest patch of Now-
ellia is about a foot
square.

1. Ganoderma lucidum.
Several from last
year on an elm or oak
stump near the Nowellia
area.

2. Hypholoma fasciculare.
One tuft.

3. Agaricus arvensis.
One.  [probably campestris agg.]

4. Xylaria hypoxylon.
Abundant.

5. Stereum hirsutum.

[5884-5885]
5884
Abundant, mainly oak.

6.Auricularia mesenterica.
Very abundant, mainly
elm.

7.Daldinia concentrica.
Scarce, ash.

8.Armillaria mellea.
Rhizomorphs are abun-
dant on logs in the
Nowellia region and for
a short distance round.
None were seen in other
parts of the wood and
it is unlikely that the
fungus is as common
as at Buff Wood or
Chippenham Fen.

5885
9. Mitrophora gigas.
A small group.

10. Polyporus squamosus.
Probably the main
killer of large elms.
One very large tree
is lying on the ground
broken in pieces, with
the top lying over the 
bottom half.  It is
unlikely that this is
due to human activity.
Probably the tree broke
up in its fall like a
falling wall. The process
may have been assisted
byy the top half colliding
with a neighbouring tree.

The ground flora of
the wood is of the usual
boulder-clay types:
Primula elatior (no [!!!!]
[!!!!] primrose and only two
plants of [!!!!] cowslip.),
Mercurialis, Scilla, Hedera,
Carex sylvatica. They
form a very complex
mosaic. The shrubs
are relatively thin
in cover, and although
most spp are present, some
(Viburnum lantana, Euony-
mus) are rare.
There are several

[5888-5889]
5888

very fine maples.
The national Conser-
vation Corps has recently
done some clearing,
cutting down some fairly
large trees.
[DIAG]

5889
A small tuft of
Sedum telephium was
found in the middle of
a disused drove.
A nettle with helical
[!!!!] phyllotaxis was found
in Orwell Wood.
[DIAG]

[5890-5891]
5890
A length of stem has
twisted ridges, and a
groove runs round it
in a continuous helix.
The groove bears leaves
and stipules continuously
without any gaps. The
abnormal part bears
14 leaves, each with a
pair of stipules, in each
turn of the helix.  It
begins and ends abruptly.
Above the upper end is
a normal, though slightly
twisted, internode, followed
by a normal pair of
leaves. The helical nettle
from Cadsden differs in
having internodes, and in
continuing to the tip

5891

of the shoot.
Viola hirta is the com-
monest sp. in Orwell Wood
(May 5).  It is commonly
parasitized by 1. Puccinia
violae, which forms acci-
dia on the underside of
the leaf and sometimes
on the upperside too. 23
Arum seedings (see
overleaf for plant at least
2 years old) are abundant
in Orwell Wood. One leaf
(+ 1 shaeth). The main veins
are shown in details. There
are many small reticula-
tions and blind endings.
There is a very fine
marginal vein and an
extremely narrow wing.

[5892-5893]

An elm seedling was
found at Orwell. The ve-
nation of cotyledons and
leaves is remarkably com-

5893
[DIAG]
plex and
not shown
in detail.
Note that

[5894-5895]
5894

the leaves are inserted
opposite to each other
and directly above the
cotyledons.
Seligeria paucifolia
is abundant on loose
bits of chalk on the
steep slope in Hill Plan-
tation, often forming a
dense turf.

2 (May 5). On straw in
the clay lump of an
early 19th cent. farmhouse,
now derelict, below Hill
Plantation. Frequently
buried in the clay.
Black mycelial cushions,
c. 1/8 in. diam.
Hyphae black, much

5895

branched.
Perithecia irregularly
globula, about 350 [SYMBOL]
diam., chestnut brown,
irregular hyphae sprouting
from the surface, contain-
ing vast numbers of
ascospores.
Spores lemon-shaped,
purple, 11 x 8 {SYMBOL], no visible
differentiation.
Chaetomium sp.
26

3. (May 5). About five under
various trees in different
parts of the wood. Up
to 4 - 7 - 1 1/2 (top) 2 1/2 (bottom).
P. globular, divided by
anastomosing ridges into

[5896-5897]
5896

fields about 3 in. diam,
these in turn ridged
and puckered; with a hole
in the top leading into
the hollow interior; khaki;
thin, light, brittle.
S. as in Mitrophora gi-
gas, but larger, bloated,
tapering above.
Morchella esculenta.

PLAN OF TREES CUT DOWN
ON THE SITE OF NEW LECK-
HAMPTON HOUSE.
The plan on p. 5862 is geo-
graphically more accurate.
Page numbers are given.
In the descriptions, the total
diameter is quoted, but increments
over periods of years are given
as the thickness of the shell.
