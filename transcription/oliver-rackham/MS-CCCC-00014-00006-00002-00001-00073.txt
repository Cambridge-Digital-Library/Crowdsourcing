Nowellia is, how-
-ever, not one
of the more
hygrophytic bryophytes, since
it grows mainly on
branches well clear of
the ground. The presence
of Armillaria may well
be important. Most of
the trees concerned
seem to have died about
the same time. Rhizo-
morphs cannot, of course,
be[!!!!] seen in them,
but more recently dead
trees show them under
the bark. Perhaps a
deterioration of drainage
during the agricultural
depression or the war

[5882-5883]
5882
resulted in [????] simultan-
-eous death of many
trees in this wet bottom,
and the rapid fall of
the bark resulting from
Armillaria attack produced
a kind of substratum
suitable for Nowellia. None
of the more recently
killed trees seems to
have reached a state suit-
able for colonization by
Nowellia.
Nowellia does not seem
to have any dispersal
mechanism here.  It does
not usually occur on the
same log with Lophocolea
spp, though these are
abundant on other logs.
5883
The largest patch of Now-
ellia is about a foot
square.

1. Ganoderma lucidum.
Several from last
year on an elm or oak
stump near the Nowellia
area.

2. Hypholoma fasciculare.
One tuft.

3. Agaricus arvensis.
One.  [probably campestris agg.]

4. Xylaria hypoxylon.
Abundant.

5. Stereum hirsutum.

[5884-5885]
5884
Abundant, mainly oak.

6.Auricularia mesenterica.
Very abundant, mainly
elm.

7.Daldinia concentrica.
Scarce, ash.

8.Armillaria mellea.
Rhizomorphs are abun-
dant on logs in the
Nowellia region and for
a short distance round.
None were seen in other
parts of the wood and
it is unlikely that the
fungus is as common
as at Buff Wood or
Chippenham Fen.

5885
9. Mitrophora gigas.
A small group.

10. Polyporus squamosus.
Probably the main
killer of large elms.
One very large tree
is lying on the ground
broken in pieces, with
the top lying over the 
bottom half.  It is
unlikely that this is
due to human activity.
Probably the tree broke
up in its fall like a
falling wall. The process
may have been assisted
byy the top half colliding
with a neighbouring tree.
