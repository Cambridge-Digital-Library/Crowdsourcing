Nowellia is, how-
-ever, not one
of the more
hygrophytic bryophytes, since
it grows mainly on
branches well clear of
the ground. The presence
of Armillaria may well
be important. Most of
the trees concerned
seem to have died about
the same time. Rhizo-
morphs cannot, of course,
be[!!!!] seen in them,
but more recently dead
trees show them under
the bark. Perhaps a
deterioration of drainage
during the agricultural
depression or the war
