Nowellia is, how-
-ever, not one
of the more
hygrophytic bryophytes, since
it grows mainly on
branches well clear of
the ground. The presence
of Armillaria may well
be important. Most of
the trees concerned
seem to have died about
the same time. Rhizo-
morphs cannot, of course,
be[!!!!] seen in them,
but more recently dead
trees show them under
the bark. Perhaps a
deterioration of drainage
during the agricultural
depression or the war

[5882-5883]
5882

resulted in [????] simultan-
-eous death of many
trees in this wet bottom,
and the rapid fall of
the bark resulting from
Armillaria attack produced
a kind of substratum
suitable for Nowellia. None
of the more recently
killed trees seems to
have reached a state suit-
able for colonization by
Nowellia.
Nowellia does not seem
to have any dispersal
mechanism here.  It does
not usually occur on the
same log with Lophocolea
spp, though these are
abundant on other logs.

5883

The largest patch of Now-
ellia is about a foot
square.

1. Ganoderma lucidum.
Several from last
year on an elm or oak
stump near the Nowellia
area.

2. Hypholoma fasciculare.
One tuft.

3. Agaricus arvensis.
One.  [probably campestris agg.]

4. Xylaria hypoxylon.
Abundant.

5. Stereum hirsutum.

[5884-5885]
5884

Abundant, mainly oak.

6.Auricularia mesenterica.
Very abundant, mainly
elm.

7.Daldinia concentrica.
Scarce, ash.

8.Armillaria mellea.
Rhizomorphs are abun-
dant on logs in the
Nowellia region and for
a short distance round.
None were seen in other
parts of the wood and
it is unlikely that the
fungus is as common
as at Buff Wood or
Chippenham Fen.

5885

9. Mitrophora gigas.
A small group.

10. Polyporus squamosus.
Probably the main
killer of large elms.
One very large tree
is lying on the ground
broken in pieces, with
the top lying over the 
bottom half.  It is
unlikely that this is
due to human activity.
Probably the tree broke
up in its fall like a
falling wall. The process
may have been assisted
by the top half colliding
with a neighbouring tree.

[5886-5887]

The ground flora of
the wood is of the usual
boulder-clay types:
Primula elatior (no [!!!!]
[!!!!] primrose and only two
plants of [!!!!] cowslip.),
Mercurialis, Scilla, Hedera,
Carex sylvatica. They
form a very complex
mosaic. The shrubs
are relatively thin
in cover, and although
most spp are present, some
(Viburnum lantana, Euony-
mus) are rare.
There are several

[5888-5889]
5888

very fine maples.
The national Conser-
vation Corps has recently
done some clearing,
cutting down some fairly
large trees.
[DIAG]

5889

A small tuft of
Sedum telephium was
found in the middle of
a disused drove.
A nettle with helical
[!!!!] phyllotaxis was found
in Orwell Wood.
[DIAG]

[5890-5891]
5890

A length of stem has
twisted ridges, and a
groove runs round it
in a continuous helix.
The groove bears leaves
and stipules continuously
without any gaps. The
abnormal part bears
14 leaves, each with a
pair of stipules, in each
turn of the helix.  It
begins and ends abruptly.
Above the upper end is
a normal, though slightly
twisted, internode, followed
by a normal pair of
leaves. The helical nettle
from Cadsden differs in
having internodes, and in
continuing to the tip

5891

of the shoot.
Viola hirta is the com-
monest sp. in Orwell Wood
(May 5).  It is commonly
parasitized by 1. Puccinia
violae, which forms acci-
dia on the underside of
the leaf and sometimes
on the upperside too. 23
Arum seedings (see
overleaf for plant at least
2 years old) are abundant
in Orwell Wood. One leaf
(+ 1 shaeth). The main veins
are shown in details. There
are many small reticula-
tions and blind endings.
There is a very fine
marginal vein and an
extremely narrow wing.

[5892-5893]

[DIAG]
An elm seedling was
found at Orwell. The ve-
nation of cotyledons and
leaves is remarkably com-

5893
[DIAG]
plex and
not shown
in detail.
Note that

[5894-5895]
5894

the leaves are inserted
opposite to each other
and directly above the
cotyledons.
Seligeria paucifolia
is abundant on loose
bits of chalk on the
steep slope in Hill Plan-
tation, often forming a
dense turf.

2 (May 5). On straw in
the clay lump of an
early 19th cent. farmhouse,
now derelict, below Hill
Plantation. Frequently
buried in the clay.
Black mycelial cushions,

Hyphae black, much

3. (May 5). About five under
various trees in different
parts of the wood. Up

P. globular, divided by
anastomosing ridges into

[5896-5897]

these in turn ridged
and puckered; with a hole
in the top leading into
the hollow interior; khaki;
thin, light, brittle.
S. as in Mitrophora gi-
gas, but larger, bloated,
tapering above.
Morchella esculenta.

ON THE SITE OF NEW LECK-
HAMPTON HOUSE.

Pine 1. A big tree with many
rather heavy branches,
doubtless owing to its iso-
lated situation. The other
pines have small cones
and no low branches
96 in. circum. 30 in. diam.
of stump. 1887. [SYMBOL] uniform
except for slow growth
1887-1907. Very little heart
wood (distinguished by ab-

cutting). Considerable
rather hard butt rot.
The root system is
branched, with no tap
root; the root ball
(as uprooted by a winch)
10ft diam. 4 [SYMBOL] ft deep.
Most of the main roots

5899

have a considerable
white mycelial sheet
over the surface and
among the bark, but
are apparently not rotted.
No rhizomorphs could
be found, and the myce-
lium was not strongly
luminous, but Armillaria
is not to be excluded. Height

c. 1873. Slow to 1890, uniform
thereafter.  Sapwood from
1951. Slight butt rot. Small
root ball.
Cedar (C.atlantica). Height

shorter than the big pine,
but about the same

[5900-5901]

26 in. dia  1876. Uniform
but gradually slowing after
1946. Sapwood from c. 1923.
Pine 2. About 50ft high. Root
ball 7ft diam., 3ft deep.
Cut at 32ft up: 1914.

1879-1939). Very narrow
1939-46; 1[SYMBOL] in. rad. 1939-62.
1900, 1920, 1921 were very
thin years. Heartwood
to 1889
Pine 4. Similar to above. Cut

5901

at base: c. 1881, 22 in. Slow
after 1920, very slow after
1940. Sapwood after 1920.
Acacia 1. 14-16 in. diam. 1905.
Very slow up to 1912, uniform
thereafter. Sapwood (lemon
yellow, as against khaki
heartwood) after 1958. 1922,
1944 were very thin years.
A slender tree about as
tall as the pines.
Sycamore 1. (Acer [SYMBOL]). 13-14 in.

May 9.
A squamous type of
rot has developed in
the chestnut trees lopped
on May 7 (p.5873), on the
tissues damaged and ex-
posed by a previous lopping.
Most of this decayed
[!!!!]wood[!!!!] has been cut off,
but some remains.
A small tuft of Hypho-
loma fasciculare was
found between the swim-
ming pool and the chest-

May 10.
There is a fine hybrid
swarm of cowslips
in the S. half of
Leckhampton.  One parent

5911

is the ordinary wild
type, the other differs
in the bloody crimson
corolla. The wild type
predominates, pure crim-
son being rare.  The inter-
mediates have orange
and various shades
of reddish-brown corollas.
They show slightly in-
creased vegetative vigour.
May 11.
The roses in the garden
have suffered considerably
in the winter. Some shoots
have been killed down
to the crown. Part of the
damage may be directly
due to frost, but fungus
parasites seem to have

[5912-5913]
5912

been at work, usually
entering by a frosted
bud or through the
dead base of a leaf
which failed to abscide
owing to frost. Old
and young branches
have been equally af-
fected.

The largest of the

The Harleston sycamore
is very late in opening
its lvs. The buds are
still closed, while those

The Fuchsia has been
killed down to the
ground, including branches
c. 1 [SYMBOL] in. diam. dating
probably from 1954. It
is shooting from the base.
The Cotoneaster under
the dining-room window
is almost dead.
Both plants of Cerato-
stigma are shooting
from the base, having
been killed above ground.
They were hastily pro-
tected in winter by
cutting down their own

litter on top.
The only confier
much affected is the

front Chamaecyparis;
the yews have been
only slightly browned.
The artichokes are
coming up.
May 13.
The timbers taken
out of the roof of the

watch beetle (also incendiary
bombs), but little fungal attack.
