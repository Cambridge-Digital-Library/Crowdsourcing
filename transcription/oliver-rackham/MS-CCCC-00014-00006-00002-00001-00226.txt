Marsh Wood, Polstead. Gone.

At A there is a 
short length of 
hedge domina-
ted by Tilia
cordata.
Grove B is intact - tho'cut 
into by road - widening - and is 
ash - birch without lime. 
Watson's Corner 
Crescent-shaped wood to N.E. 
survives: much elm.
Wood along road to E. survives: 
mainly suckering elm.

Dec. 25.           64th
A large black-birch tree
on the steep slope below Bishop-
bridge Roadstill has most of 
its leaves, many of which are green
in the middle. 

Dec. 26. 
Mousehold.
PHYTOPHTHORA. Seven dried-blood
exudations, all old, on Betula
pubescens about 1/4 mile along
Valley Drive. Highest is some
7 ft above tree. Tree young - 
- mature, apparently healthy. 

At the N. corner of the Heath 
there is about 50 ac. of furze & heather,
still largely uninvaded. This
area is cratered with small 
gravel-pits. 
Furze cover patchy, more con-
tinuous around edges.
Calluna covers about 1/6 of the 
total area, extending on the 
N.E. into light birch. Bushes
low, mostly in the young or

middle-aged state, flat
topped, probably eaten
to some extent by
rabbits. No bush
more than about
2 ft high; the
big old bushes
of the Breck-
land are absent.
Agrostis tenuis
v. ab., co-dominant
with the heather in most
of the non-furze area. 
Erica cineria loc. ab., more 
abundant than Calluna in 
the N.W. of the patch. 
Bracken frequent, but fronds
sparse and small, rarely dom-
inant.

[17546-17547]

Rumex acetosella v. ab. esp. 
as coloniserof burnt ground. 
No Roff zone observed round
Calluna bushes
Polytrichum spp. abundant
but only in small patches. 
Lichens very much less 
prominent that on most of
the Breckland. Nothing except 
small cladonias seen. 
This area corresponds to Grass-
land E on Lakenheath Warren, 
but has much more furze, less
bracken, and practically no
lichens. On sandy gravel. 
Invasion is mainly on the 
E., mainly by birch; in the 
W. and middle are scattered 
sapling trees, about half of which
are oak. 

About 1/6 on this open area
has been burnt this summer.
Some of the fires in the E. have 
invaded birch forming an almost 
closed canopy. Birches up to c. 
3in. dia. appear to have been
killed to ground level. Many
have small coppice shoots from 
the collar, actively growing until
now, but very chlorotic. 
Erica cinerea has the habit 
of a small Calluna. Frequently
still in the flower. 

There is another smaller 
Calluna area S. of Gurney Road.
Also subject to birch invasion
but still mostly open. Part of 
thishasbeen burnt.

[17548-17549]
Invasion over most of the 
Heath is chiefly birch, over
a long period of years. Oaks
are constantly present; 
within some 300 yds of the NE
boundary they become dominant
owing to the many big trees 
along Heartsease Lane. 
Hawthorn invasion confined to 
patches along the W. side, 
especially in the bottom of the 
main dry valley, associated 
with ivy and Anthriscus.
  Although Pinus sylvestris
and nigra occur in many 
small groups, presumably
planted, no young onesare to
be seen: contrast Lakenheath 
Warren. 

  Few rhododendron bushes 
near the junction of Gilman
and Gurney Roads. No young
ones. 
  Furze is occasionally in
flower. 
  Tencrium is abundant in 
places S. of Gurney Road.

Thorpe Marshes
   South and East of Whitlingham
Station the marshes are in present 
use (grazed today by sheep). Ditches 
and drovesas on 2 1/2" map. 
   West of Whitlingham Station 
the marsh is disused - not yet 
overgrown with trees. 

[17550-17551]

   Azolla was apparently seen 
in quantity, as a red surface 
layer, in a ditch alongside the 
small improved pastureN.W. of Whit-
lingham Station. 

Weston Ward
   Many trees have been blown
down in apparently the same
S.W. gale about ayear ago. 
(1) A big oak on the gravel
hillside, which in its fall brought 
down another oak and partly
uprooted a third.  All these 
have a root-mat about 2 ft
deep, with few or no roots
directly under the trunk. 
Roots of the first tree to fall
were partly rottedon the 
downslope (windward)side. 

(2) The last remaining part of
the forked (? pollard) beech at 
the bottom of the slope. 
(3) The beech with 1820 graffito. 
Rooted apparently in silt, orange 
- yellow colour, with very few 
small stones (specimen col-
lected). Root-mat about 1ft
thick, spreading sideways. 
Below the trunk and central 
portion of the mat are numerous
deeper roots of varying dia-
meters, all of them dead and
long-decayed, some represented 
only by channels on the silt. 
The living roots are all thin. 
[DIAG]


[17552-17553]
Crown twigs show irregular growth 
with periods of very short internodes.
This strongly suggests that the 
tree grew fairly fast when young
and then had a long period with 
a greatly-reduced root system. 
  This apparently leaves only
one surviving native beech.  
(4) Big standard hornbeam.

2 January 1976. 
   An exceptionally severe gale 
suddenly arose in the evening. 
I went out at about 11p.m.
by which time most of the 
damage had been done. Sheep's 
Green full of fallen trees. Every
shop awning left out in the 
town had been torn to shreds. 
Streets hazardous from falling
slates and especially from 
corrugated iron and plywood
blown from building sites. 
The electricity went off for 
about 10min. 
   At that time it was possible 
with caution to bycycle around
the town. In the lime-tree
avenue on the windwardside
of Leckhampton the big trees 

[17554-17555]
could be felt bending with every 
gust, but none blew down. 


Jan 3. 
Trees blown down. 
(1) Southern of two great elms
on King's Piece. Two main
trunks both broke off at fork
c. 60 ft up, where they were 
each some 18" dia. One
fell some 15ft to E. and
shatteredon impact; the other
fell upwind into ditch to W. 
Wholly invaded by wetwood
with sound shell about 1 1/2"
thick; prob squamosus abo. 
This tree hasbeen visibly 
hollow at this level for years. 
[SYMBOL]4
(2) Half of forked main trunk 
from tall Up, one of those on 
Clare Piece. Split some 4 ft 
long, formed some years ago

[17556-17557]
[DIAG]
at narrow crotch and never
healed. Timber
with severe
though inactive
wetwood
no squamosus.
Fallen trunk hit the ground
10 p. downwind. It was 
about 14" dia.

(3) Bough c. 7" across from 
another of these procera elms,
outside Clare back gate. 
String active wetwood, no
other evident weakness. Not 
a narrow fork. 

(4) Bough c. 12" across from 
some 30ft up another of the 
same elms, third from the N. 

in the eastern of the two [????]
Very narrow crotch with 
included fold of bark. No
previous split  [SYMBOL]3 [DIAG]
but
section
evidently
very
weak. 

(5)
Next elm to the N. 
Pollarded once many years
ago. Two of the four pollard 
poles have fallen, one c. 18", the 
other 12" dia. Similar weak-
ness to the above, but more
severe, with a decayed cavity
containing roots. 

[17558-17559]
On Sheep's Green.  [SYMBOL]2 
Between Fen Causeway and the
first path, W. of the channel. 
(6) Sx alba, 2ft dia., well
defined rotten core honeycombed 
with what appear to be death 
watch beetle holes. Shell of
about 2" sound wood. Snapt
off about 3 ft up. 

(7) Sx alba, c. 18 in., shattered 
by fall of above. 

(8) Lombardy 2 1/2ft dia, 40p.
high, broken off slanting from
7 ft to ground. One big
buttress on W. side rotted away:
about 1/3 of section is slightly 
delignified, little discoloured, 
with mycelial sheets. 

(9)Lombardy snapt off 8ft high,
c. 3ft dia. Small pockets of rot
low down on W. side, without 
cubical cracking, much riddled
by beetle. More extensive decay
on S. side near base in angle. 
This tree and the preceding
hadabout 2/3of the section
more or less undamaged, but
with weaknesses in the windward
side. 35 p. high. 

(10) Mod. sized Sx alba, has
lost the top of the trunk, 
1 1/4' dia., at about 20 ft up. 
Extensive core of pinkish rot 
with white flecks. 

(11) Mod. sized willow badly 
sprung by fall of (9).
