23 October.   REWLEY HOUSE
               OXFORD
  Extra-Mural weekend on the
history of woods & hedges.
  Lecture last evening. About
75 people. About 65 people came
on today's excursion.

  Burleigh Wood, Cassington
         & Bladon.
  Woodbank is now clearly
visible round N. and E. bounda-
aries.
  Small area of aspen.
  Interior successfully conif-
erized; little trace remains of
2917
previous woodland except round
edges.
 
    Pinsley Wood.
  Many similar deciduous trees;
no underwood appears to remain. 

       Woodstock Park.
  Entered at the usual place,
Point 373; went as far as High
Lodge and a ittle beyond.
Surprisingly less wet than on
previous visits, despite recent
rains.
   Ancient oaks unchanged.
   Many dead oaks in rthe 
High Lodge area & below. These
appear to be at least 30 years
dead. Not pollards; probably of
B-generation.
[22918-22919]
2918
  Many recent plantations
of fancy trees.
  Old Oaks appear to stop at
the gate at Point 373. West of
here none were seen. The park
has a boundary belt of tall
well-grown beeches, prob. early
19th-cent., now much died-back
and many dead doubtless thro'
1976 drought.
  Grassland is mechanically 
mown. The only young trees
are ashes protected by low boughs
of oaks; there are a few oak-
lings but these are unlikely
to survive.
  A-generation oaks occasionally
reach 5 ft dia. Some are very
tall. Staghead is evidently of
several dates on different trees.
2921
  Occasional patches of mercury,
sometimes mixed with bracken.
No maple seen (but cf p. 424).
  Note the hilltop ponds at
High Lodge.

S.E. of Woodstock Park. All exo-
tic trees; some oaks may remain
in former field boundaries.
Boundary wall of dry limestone
rag, c. 6 ft high, with mortared
coping, well maintained.
Numerous internal walls.

Elms. The East Anglian elm,
by Burleigh Wood is well alive.
Hedge near here, and hedge-
row suckers elsewhere in Ox-
fordshire, appear unaffected by
disease. Most Up are felled.
[22920-22921]
2920
      Notoaks Wood.
  Boundary banks (p.18767)
are now well visible owing
to felling of bushes. Old wood-
bank is set with oak and
maple stubs.

     Cornbury Park.
  Thickly set with exotic
trees, but may have some old
oaks.

        Wychwood Forest.
  No coppicing since previous
visit. Several copse-banks
visible; all the lights and plains
appear ro be overgrown. Little
u/w structure survives.
  Sycamore u/w has grown 
well since last visit (p. 425).
2921
Leafield Barrow is prominent
to W. of the village.

24 Oct. Lectures on hedges at
Rewley House.
  The River Thames is much in
flood.
Elms. Hedges ast Thame full
of Up suckers; no disease.
