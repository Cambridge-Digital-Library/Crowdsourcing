November 30.  "[SYMBOL]"
Hayley Wood.
Visited with Abbotsley [????]
District Pigeon [????] Rabbit Clearance
Society's chairman, Mr Sharp, and 
Mr Cooper, of Pest Control Services.
We met Mr Cox, who reported 
damage to crops by rabbits 
leaving the wood on the W. and 
S.W. sides.
We inspected the whole of 
the boundary on the N. and 
W. sides and the W. half of 
the S. side.
Rabbit holes are numerous 
on the W. and S. sides in the 
low bank formed by turning
the earth from the boundary
ditch into the wood.
On the N. side, we found


[7638-7639]
recent holes visible from the rail-
way, but there were signs that
rabbits did emerge from the wood
on this side, though not to any
great extent.
In the interior of the wood,
we found no holes, apart from a 
few in the banks around Hay-
L[????]y Lane. The water level is now
high and rising fast, and most
of the area will soon be unin-
habitable.

Under the great oak which
stands just outside the wood
in the middle of the S.side, we
found a paunch which we a-
greed was that of a fallow 
deer slain within the week. Near-
by, we foudn two deer snares.
one set in such a way as to
catch a deer as it left the
wood and jumped the ditch.
Some blood on the logs in the
bottom of the ditch showed that
one had already been killed there.
The snares were impounded.
They consist of a running 
noose of stout 4-strand
galvanized fence-wire formed
into a circle about 2ft diam.
and propped up in a vertical
plane. The end of the wire
is made fast to a stout
log. One was fitted with a 
swivel.
Mr Cooper says he has seen 
muntjac tracks in the wood.

Funaria hygrometrica occurs


[7640-7641]
in dense stands on bonfire
sites of the 1965 plot.
An oak in the middle 
of the N.quarter has been
snapped off about half-way
up recently. It was brown-
-rotted in the heart.
Mnium undulatum is 
rather scattered and local in 
the N. quarter.

Pleurotus cornucopioides. Still flour-
ishing on an elm log.

December 1.
Mnium undulatum is very
local in Madingley Wood: it
forms dense patches under
spruces near the middle of 
the "pan-handle" and scattered
tufts occur on the ride
leading down to the latter
from the Coton gate.
December 2.
The following mosses were
plasmolyzed:
Mnium undulatum,
Eurhynchium swartzii,
Funaria hygrometrica,
Rhytidiadelphus squamosus.
All went at about 1M 1½M
in potassium chloride, but sucrose
had no effect even at 2½M. There
was no sign of recovery. LiCl
had much the same effect as
KCl; CaCl2 caused prosenchy-
matous cells to plasmolyze
from the sides as distinct from
the ends as with KCl; ethylene
glucol had no effect. In some,


[7642-7643]
such as the Rhytidiadelphus,
there is much variation between
the middle, the wings, tip,
base, and auricles. The [!!!!]suction[!!!!] osmotic
pressure may be increased
by about ½osm. by leaving
the moss in a covered dish
exposed to sunlight for a day.
[Diag]

December 3.
The youngest sporophores of 
the great ring of Clitocybe nebularis
at Madingley Wood are still
mature.
December 4.
Rhytidiadelphus squamosus
is very abundant from end to
end of Le[????]champton, coming
up into the terrace lawn in front
of the house (thought not
apparently yet in the new
lawns). It is very luxuriant
under tall bushes where the
mower does not reach. It forms
dense pure stands here.
December 5.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).
Following heavy rain for 
over 24 hours. water has been


[7644-7645]
coming down all round the
trunks of trees instead of in 
flow lines only. About ¼ of
the coppice area is under
water, including some bonfire
sites.

1. Stool ash. Felled by axe. 9in.
1898[SYMBOL]1. Fast growth till 1920,
thereafter gradually slowing.
1910 very narrow.

2. Coppice oak from a stump
closely resembling the others
in the wood. 11 x 7½ in. (markedly
excentric). Much heart-wood.
1917[SYMBOL]1. 1936 narrow. 1951-5
wide. Not butt-rotted. A small
crooked tree.

3. Ash. 9in. 1900. uniform
except for 1911-15 (very narrow),
1926 (very wide), 1944-5 (narrow),
1959 - (narrow).

4. Stool maple. 9in. 61 years.

The pond is nearly up to 
the level of the surrounding
land on the N.W.
December 6.
The river is in spate, almost
up to the edge of the Anchor
quay. Part of Sheep's Green is 
under water.
December 1.
Cold-front weather with a 
hard frost
December 8.
Dry rot on the street side
