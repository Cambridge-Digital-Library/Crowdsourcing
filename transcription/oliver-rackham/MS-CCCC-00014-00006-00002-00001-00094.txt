[7637]
November 30.  "[SYMBOL]"
Hayley Wood.
Visited with Abbotsley [????]
District Pigeon [????] Rabbit Clearance
Society's chairman, Mr Sharp, and 
Mr Cooper, of Pest Control Services.
We met Mr Cox, who reported 
damage to crops by rabbits 
leaving the wood on the W. and 
S.W. sides.
We inspected the whole of 
the boundary on the N. and 
W. sides and the W. half of 
the S. side.
Rabbit holes are numerous 
on the W. and S. sides in the 
low bank formed by turning
the earth from the boundary
ditch into the wood.
On the N. side, we found


[7638-7639]
recent holes visible from the rail-
way, but there were signs that
rabbits did emerge from the wood
on this side, though not to any
great extent.
In the interior of the wood,
we found no holes, apart from a 
few in the banks around Hay-
L[????]y Lane. The water level is now
high and rising fast, and most
of the area will soon be unin-
habitable.

Under the great oak which
stands just outside the wood
in the middle of the S.side, we
found a paunch which we a-
greed was that of a fallow 
deer slain within the week. Near-
by, we foudn two deer snares.
one set in such a way as to
catch a deer as it left the
wood and jumped the ditch.
Some blood on the logs in the
bottom of the ditch showed that
one had already been killed there.
The snares were impounded.
They consist of a running 
noose of stout 4-strand
galvanized fence-wire formed
into a circle about 2ft diam.
and propped up in a vertical
plane. The end of the wire
is made fast to a stout
log. One was fitted with a 
swivel.
Mr Cooper says he has seen 
muntjac tracks in the wood.

Funaria hygrometrica occurs


[7640-7641]
in dense stands on bonfire
sites of the 1965 plot.
An oak in the middle 
of the N.quarter has been
snapped off about half-way
up recently. It was brown-
-rotted in the heart.
Mnium undulatum is 
rather scattered and local in 
the N. quarter.

Pleurotus cornucopioides. Still flour-
ishing on an elm log.

December 1.
Mnium undulatum is very
local in Madingley Wood: it
forms dense patches under
spruces near the middle of 
the "pan-handle" and scattered
tufts occur on the ride
leading down to the latter
from the Coton gate.
December 2.
The following mosses were
plasmolyzed:
Mnium undulatum,
Eurhynchium swartzii,
Funaria hygrometrica,
Rhytidiadelphus squamosus.
All went at about 1M 1½M
in potassium chloride, but sucrose
had no effect even at 2½M. There
was no sign of recovery. LiCl
had much the same effect as
KCl; CaCl2 caused prosenchy-
matous cells to plasmolyze
from the sides as distinct from
the ends as with KCl; ethylene
glucol had no effect. In some,


[7642-7643]
such as the Rhytidiadelphus,
there is much variation between
the middle, the wings, tip,
base, and auricles. The [!!!!]suction[!!!!] osmotic
pressure may be increased
by about ½osm. by leaving
the moss in a covered dish
exposed to sunlight for a day.
[Diag]

December 3.
The youngest sporophores of 
the great ring of Clitocybe nebularis
at Madingley Wood are still
mature.
December 4.
Rhytidiadelphus squamosus
is very abundant from end to
end of Le[????]champton, coming
up into the terrace lawn in front
of the house (thought not
apparently yet in the new
lawns). It is very luxuriant
under tall bushes where the
mower does not reach. It forms
dense pure stands here.
December 5.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).
Following heavy rain for 
over 24 hours. water has been


[7644-7645]
coming down all round the
trunks of trees instead of in 
flow lines only. About ¼ of
the coppice area is under
water, including some bonfire
sites.

1. Stool ash. Felled by axe. 9in.
1898[SYMBOL]1. Fast growth till 1920,
thereafter gradually slowing.
1910 very narrow.

2. Coppice oak from a stump
closely resembling the others
in the wood. 11 x 7½ in. (markedly
excentric). Much heart-wood.
1917[SYMBOL]1. 1936 narrow. 1951-5
wide. Not butt-rotted. A small
crooked tree.

3. Ash. 9in. 1900. uniform
except for 1911-15 (very narrow),
1926 (very wide), 1944-5 (narrow),
1959 - (narrow).

4. Stool maple. 9in. 61 years.

The pond is nearly up to 
the level of the surrounding
land on the N.W.
December 6.
The river is in spate, almost
up to the edge of the Anchor
quay. Part of Sheep's Green is 
under water.
December 1.
Cold-front weather with a 
hard frost
December 8.
Dry rot on the street side

[7646-7647]
of E staircase has consumed
several bonding courses on 
the outside wall of three
storeys, and has caused several
floor joists to be plated.
December 9.
The Leckhampton Primulas 
are developing leaf rosettes.
December 10.
Owls have not been much
heard recently in Leckhampton.
December 11.
The sedum from the
Lamfenjoch rapidly shrivels in 
a warm room.
December 12.
Polystictus versicolor.
Abundant on an old
pear butt with roots which
has been lying about for

some years out of doors at 
Coton anbd was now split up 
for firewood. Many sporophores
on downward-facing surfaces
and in this case sessile
at an excentric point on the 
back, or [!!!!]to[!!!!] stalked from the 
back. Occasionally there
[Diag]

[7648-7649]
is a perfectly central stalk
from the back. Dorsal stalks
are clothed like the back.
Colours fawn. P.5. pale pink.
very chatoyant.
This fungus is apparently
responsible for a softish pink
rot. Armillaria appeared
to be in some areas of the 
stump demarcated by zone
plates.
December 13.
A remarkable Chrysanthemum
was among a bouquet pre-
sented to Mrs Evans at a 
function. The others are 
a standard double commercial
variety with curling yellow
florets with small ragged scale
on the surfance. The largest

(about 4 in. diam) is completely
divided through the middle,
one half being similar to the
others in all respects, the
other half having pure white
smooth florets similar in 
shape. Some of the white
florets nearest the line of
junction have traces of 
yellow near the base. The 
junction line is straight
and diametric. There is
no visible difference in the 
bracts or the stem: the 
secondary heads have all 
been removed when young.
This specimen probably came
from a funereal set-piece
dismbembered for the occasion
and it would be diccicult to 


[7650-7651]
trace its origin.
December 14.
The chimerical chrysanthemum
was photographed and pressed.
December 15.
Akebia in Leckhampton
loses its leaflets.
December 16.
A soft damp brown rot
was found in an oaken
sill of the wall on the
N. side of Q staircase passage
in the Old Court during
renewal of the floor. The 
sill had been below the 
level of the former brick
floor. It is not clear whether
any studs were attached to
it.
December 17.

The rotten sill was removed
and replaced by brickwork
December 18.
The Cam is again very 
high.
Norton Wood, W. Suffolk,
is of oak standards with 
birch coppice. Undergrowth
less dense than is usual
in Cambs.
There is very considerable
flooding of  wet meadows
in Suffolk:
(i) Valley of Barnham Water
at Tostock.
(ii) Valley at Wetherden.
(iii) Gipping valley from
Haughley southwards. The
water is up to ¼ mile
wide, in places (as just




[7652-7653]
above the Fisons works at Bram-
ford) flowing and moving
continuously all across the
meadows. The river is 
rather clear, except where 
it suddenly contracts as 
at Bramford. It is not
embanked in any way.
December 19.  [Diag]
There is still
a large area of heath in 
Bixley, Foxhall. Purdis-farm,
and Nacton. It is mainly furze.
It extends into the municipal
boundary of Ipswich.
December 20. [Diag]
The river reached the 
top surface of the Anchor
quay but has since gone
down.

December 21.
The weather is now less
wet.
December 22.
Gulls are about in Norwich
December 23. [Diag]
Honesty seedlings are numerous.
December 24.
Both large sycamores in 
The front flowered abundantly
this year.
December 25
A definite coal-tit was
seen to come to a bag of 
pea-nuts on the trellis: the 
first [!!!!] seen in the garden.
December 26.
Collybia relutipes occurs on 
a poplar in Morse Avenue.
The trunk is still alive,

[7654-7655]
though moribund from repeated
lopping.
December 27.
A log cut from the [????]ew in
the front garden during
recent trimming was 2½ in
diam, 12 years old, with about
6 years of heart-wood.
December 28.
Following several days of 
hard frost, the ground was 
frozen to 1½ in. deep (bare
ground in several places in
the garden).
December 29.
Roses are flowering at
G[????]leston despite the frost.
The Lothingland sea-cliffs
consist of sandy gravels and 
sands overlying clay. The spring

line (clearly visible today because
of an accumulation of massive
ice) is some 6ft from the surface
near Corton church, but sinks
northwards and disappears
under the beach against G[????]leston
golf links. The rate of erosion
appears to be greatest
where the springs are lowest.
Run-off from fields has
led to some wash-outs.
The small sycamore
wood on the cliff top opposite
Hopton has been badly 
damaged following the fellling 
of a strip about 6 yards
wide along the cliff. Much
of the rest of the wood has 
died.
Smymium is vigoroulsy mak-


[7656-7657]
ing new growth. One plant
was found flowering. The old
f[????]s have a strong characteristic
carraway-like flavour.
December 30.
A rook alighted in the big oak tree about 100 yards S.
of the E.end of the garden.
Collybia [????]elutipes is turgid
after the frost.
December 31.
An hornbeam tree was seen
in a hedge at Uggeshall.
Holly trees are common in 
Blything.


January 1.
The river is again [Diag]
high after heavy rain.
January 2.
Cnsiderable changes were 
made among the pot plants
thus:
[!!!!] Repotted. 1. Aloe from 4 in.
to 6 in. Roots formed a 

[Diag]

loose cage around the sides


[7658-7659]
and bottom of the pot. 7 leaves
photosynthetic, remains of 8
old ones. There is one 
stolon about 2in. long from
the collar, about to break
through the surface.
2. Gasteria ("Bishop's"), from Mrs
Tuck. From 4" to 6". A mass
of fibrous roots concentrated at
the sides and bottom of the 
pot. The main rosette has
12 active leaves in three
twisted rows. Around it are
six stolons, of which one is
about to break through,
and the other five bear
5,4,4,3,3 aerial leaves. The 
leaf arrangement does not
develop until the fifth leaf
(see sketch).

The following weed
seeds were sown in [!!!!]

shallow seed-pots, in a
mixture of sand and Leck-
hampton soil(as was used
for potting the succulents) and 
placed out on the  balcony
under a net:
