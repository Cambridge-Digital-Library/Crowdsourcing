Rhine-
field walk
is a part
of the Forest with avenues
of exotics planted among
native woodlands. These in-
clude Sitka Spruce, Coriscan,
Douglas, and Sequoia, all 
of remarkable size. The
Douglas grows into a big
tree, with a wide squarish
crown and a rugged trunk
about 3ft down. Nearby, on
the Christchurch-Lyndhurst 
road, is a belt of Corsican 
the highest in the country,
which reached 130ft some 
years ago.
The Hatchet Pond is 
a curious lake, quite deep

[7878-7879]

but fluctuating.
There are large quantities
of Spartina in the Beaulieu
River.
Pulmonaria longifolia (an-
gustifolia) is very local in
a hedge-bank and at the 
edge of a wood at Newlands,
St Leonnard's. It grows in
otherwise unremarkable mar-
ginal vegetation including
Primroses and Potentilla 
fragariastrum. 
Elm and ash are almost 
absent from the New Forest. 
The New Forest ends 
abruptly at the Wilts border 
on the N. On the W. it 
extends as far as the  
Avon, and continues little 
changed in the Dorset heaths. 
March 22 (cont. from p. 7775). 
Crousa Downs
The fields in the S. apex of 
the Kestlemem's triangle of 
roads, around 766189, are closely 
strewn with weathered gabbro 
boulders, which occupty roughly 
1/8 of the total area. These  
mostly lie flat and project  
up to 3ft out of the 
ground. They are in long-heath 
which is burnt annually, 
some of it having just been 
fired. The fire destroys  
the epiphytes on all but
the top surfaces of the
larger boulders. Consequently
there is a poor development
of lichens, though [!!!!]Rh[????][!!!!] Hedingia

[7880-7881]

is abundant.
At the N. end of these
fields is a pair of gabbro
boulders about 12ft high
standing on edge and leaning
towards each other but
not quite touching. In 
front is a circle [!!!!][????][!!!!] of boulders
probably artificial. Spheenophorus
occurs abundantly on the
big boulders.
March 23 (cont. from p. 7785.)
Lanyon Quoit, the mega-
lithic chamber from a vanished 
long-barrow, is not remarkable
for its epiphytes.
The Porthmeor stream
(p.7777) is a much smaller
and narrower stream than
that at Lanyon Farm, and
runs in a little ravine filled
and concealed with short
tortuous trees, mainly Salix
atrocinerea.
Cam Galva (p.7782) has
a number of flat blocks
of granite on top of parts
of its ridge (in other parts, 
the blocks have fallen 
as the joints are not so
horizontal and vertical and
so much less stable). These 
have small hollows (a[!!!!] few
in. across and deep) dis-
solved out by rain, and
usually filled with water.
At Hayle are extensive 
mud-flats, but without any
well-developed salt-marsh
vegetation.

[7882-7883]

March 24 (cont. from p. 7796).
Around Enys Head (as
around Coverack) there are 
large areas of Prunus scrub 
on seaward-facing slopes.
This forms win-joined
hedge-like masses, rarely
over 3ft high, but intricate 
and impenetrable.
Allium babingtonii is 
frequest in the ravine 
below Poltesco.
The geology of Kennack 
is very complex. The western 
cliffs are mainly serpentine, 
but with several systems of 
dykes; the latter are mainly
gabbro, up to 2ft thick, 
varying in colour and some-
times with fine crystals. The 
serpentine and gabbro, where 
cooled by neighbouring dykes, 
are [????]ally rendered soft and 
easily weathered. Crig-a-tana 
and Cae[????]ve[????]acks (both visited
at ELWS) are serpentine with 
dykes.
In the eastern bay are
small dunes of calcareous
sand composed mainly of
shell fragments. These lie on 
a Pliocene raised beach 
([????] much the same way 
as Upton Towans are on an 
old marine platform). Recent
washing of sand from the 
beach has revealed a peat 
bed with Cladium in the 
eastern bay.

[7884-7885]

A large quantity of [????]-
-balls and several miserable
carcases of birds were 
washed up on the eastern
beach.
Arthropyrenia is a curious 
immersed black lichen 
found only on the shells of 
Balanus perforatus and 
other barnacles.
Gongylanthus was not 
found on the eastern cliffs, 
despite careful search, though 
Juncus capitatus occurs.
Orobanche alba was found 
on the eastern cliffs. 
Allium babingtonii occurs 
at Kennack. 
Cyperus longus is said to 
grow in a little fen at the 
mouth of the Gwenter beck.
Mullion Cove shows the 
usual zonatin of Xanthoria 
and other lichens, mainly on 
serpentine. 
Mallow and beet years 
are said to alternate on 
Mullion Island, as on other 
islands around this coast. 
At Gunwalloe, there is 
again an extensive area 
of sandy Towans on in-
land rocks. The cliffs between 
Poldhu Cove and Gunwalloe 
Church-cove are of a very 
rotten red rock. There is a 
small area of dunes on 
Gunwalloe Castle. 
March 26.
Heathfires on gabbro (p. 7827).

[7886-7887]

These are rarely hot 
enough to damage the 
crousas, though they are 
occasionally spalled on the 
surface. Most of the rock 
vegetation is, however, con-
sumed, except on the 
larger blocks.
Sphagnum on Goonhilly Downs
(from p. 7819).
S. subsecundum var. 
auriculatum is frequent in 
isolated hummocks in 
peaty heath, but does not 
form any bogs. The only 
other Sphagum in the district 
was seen at Hayle Kimbro 
Pool, where there are about 
6 tussocks as shown on 
p. 7820.
March 27. (cont. from p. 7832)
Atlantic Gale.
Today was the height 
of the gale, which had been 
gradually increasing, for some 
3 days. The wind was 
remarkably strong, uniform, 
free from gusts, and 
warm. On Kynance Cliff, 
it was someties neces-
sary to sit down for a 
while to avoid being 
blown inland. The sea was 
very high, unbroken water 
driving up the cliffs and 
running back some 60ft above 
sea level at Venton Hill Point 
and on the Lion Rock. At the 
Apron, p. 7804, a small hanging 
gulley runs down towards 

[7888-7889]

the sea. At the head of this,
over 200ft above the sea, 
spray was coming over like 
fine rain. Everywhere else 
along Kynance cliffs, one's 
spectacles [!!!!] were salted 
up so as to impede vision 
within a few minutes. 
The wavelength of the 
big waves is up to 100 
yards -- see photograph of 
Kynance Bay. At Kynance 
Cove, reflexion from the shore 
gives rise to fine cross 
seas. 
The gale was remarkably 
silent: on the cliffs, nothing 
could be heard of the 
mighty waves below. Faint 
sounds could be heard by 
putting one's ear to the ground 
over Pigeon Ogo.
Ogo Pons ia a medium-
-sized conical stack or small 
island, some 60ft high, through 
which is a small cave 
going right through. In a 
high sea, water is forced 
out with great violence from 
the other end. 
Some of the Xanthoria 
Zone was getting washed 
with continuous water today. 
March 28. (contd. from p. 7840.)
Arum italicum is frequent 
around the coast, as at 
Chynhalls Point. It occurs 
in clefts of serpentine and 
under the edges of Prunus 
scrub, usually within 1/4 mile 

[7890-7891]

of the sea.
Asplenium marinum was 
found in rock clefts near 
the sea, but well outside the 
spray zone, at Chynhalls 
Point and Gwennap Head.
The finest plants of 
Erica vaguns are in the 
hedges along the road out 
of Coverack to the N., where 
it often exceeds 5ft high, 
as it escapes fire.
Tol Pedn Penwith (= Carn 
Guthensbra[SYMBOL]^[SYMBOL]s?) 
consists of vertical granite cliffs some 
200ft high, with a columnar 
structure (the joints being 
mainly vertical). They are 
densely covered with a 
turf of Ramalina curnowii.
The rotten granite at Porth-
gwarra Cove is many feet 
thick. Tunnels and caves 
have been dug in it in 
many places, and one of 
these, some 20 yards long, 
is used as a slipway for 
boats.
At Porthgwarra is a 
huge rounded boulder about 
15ft diam. perched on the 
hillside above the cliffs on 
Carn Scathe.
Where the Penzance-
St Buryan road crosses the 
eastern branchof the Lamorna 
river, 427273, is a damp 
hollow by the bridge with 
Sibthorpia growing on the rocks.
cont. p. 7894

[7892-7893]

March 29 (cont. from p 7850)
A prostrate ecotype of privet 
occurs in Lawarnick Pit 
amont serpentine boulders.
A large adder was seen 
at Kynance.
Scilla verna and S. autum-
nalis are both abundant 
all around the coast; often 
occurring together. Both have 
stomata just visible with the 
naked eye and easily with 
a X20 lens. S. autumnalis 
has slightly larger leaves 
with stomata confined, as 
regards the back, to longitu-
dinal bands. S. verna has 
almost uniformly scattered 
stomata. Isoetes is smaller 
and has narrower, straighter,
and more yellowish-green leaves.
Asparagus Island is 
about 100ft high. It is 
divided by a deep fissure 
into two parts. The N.W. 
part is precipitous and 
was not visited. The S.E.
part is slightly larger, pre-
cipitous all round, but with 
about an acre of luxuriant 
turf on the top, which 
slopes steeply N.E.  On the 
turf are old cultivation 
beds, around which the 
Asparagus occurs. At the 
top of the turf is a 
rocky ridge covered with 
lichens, which falls ab-
ruptly to the sea on the S.W. 
The crags were somewhat 

[7894-7895]

difficult to climb this year 
because the sand has 
receded at the base. 
The turf descends to about 
40ft from the sea on the 
N.E. side.
The Gull Rock (not visi-
ted) is a precipitous stack 
about 150ft high, the home 
of vast flocks of sea birds. 
A deep channel a few ft wide 
separates it from Asparagus 
Island. It is densely covered 
in Xanthoria.
None of the other Kynance 
stacks, ecept perhaps the Lion 
Rock, has any flowering plants.
March 28 (cont. from p. 7891).
Cynrdon Dactylon at Marazion
The classic site, where it
was first found by Ray, was 
on dunes by the present site 
of Marazion station. After the 
railway was built, the 
dunes were swept away 
by the sea, and it became 
reduced as it could no 
longer mover inland onto 
fresh unstable sand. It 
survived until recently at 
the eastern end of its 
site, where the railway does 
not come between the road 
and the sea, around 512312.
However, this year, winter 
storms have seriously eroded 
the dunes, reducing them 
to a narrow strip of rather 
[????] old dunes between the 
sea and the road. Despite 

[7896-7897]

a long search, no Cynrdon 
was found. 
Tragopogon porrifolius grows 
in the garden at the 
Channel View. 
March 30 (cont. from p. 7853).
Chaerophyllum is already 
flowering on the N. coast 
of Cornwall.
March 31 (cont. from p. 7853).
Cranborne Chase, in 
the parishes of Ebbesborne 
Wake and Tollard Royal, 
contains extensive coppice 
with standards woods. The 
structure is simple, dom-
inated by oak and hazel. 
The hazl is cut to 
within about 2in. of the 
ground with small saws. 
Coppicing is practised over 
a considerable area. The 
hazel is converted into 
hurdles on the spot. The 
longitudinal stacks are 
wedged into holes in a 
baulk of timber lying on 
the ground; they are then 
interwoven with pliable twigs. 
There are considerable 
ash woods in some of 
the N. facing steep hollows 
at the heads of dry valleys.
Hambledon Hill, Child-
-Okeford, is a vast and 
complex hill-fort. On it is 
a wood composed mainly 
of yew, covering perhaps 
20 acres. This is a largely 
[????]pine[????] stand, probably un-

[7898-7899]

even-aged, at least at 
the edges. It is now sur-
rounded for the most part 
by cultivated land.
The Hod, Steepleton Iwerne, 
is another hill-fort of the 
Pre-Roman Iron Age, with 
a Roman camp in one corner. 
The steep banks, up to 40ft 
high, have good chalk turf 
with abundant Carex humilis, 
especially on the S. facing 
slopes, and Neckera pumila. 
Carex humilis is now flow-
ering. 
There are large patches 
of nettles on some parts 
of the outer earthworks.
The W. side falls to 
the Stour in an almost 
precipitous slope. The lower 
pats of this are ash wood. 
Above is a rough chalk 
grassland, ungrazed save 
by rabbits owing to the 
perilous slope. This is 
being invaded by ash and 
hawthorn, some of which 
has recently been felled, 
probably by the Dorset Nat-
uralists who own the site. 
There are a few middle-
-aged yew trees and 
many small ones, up to 
2ft high but several years 
old.
At Knowlton, between 
Wimborne and Cranborne, 
is a ring earthwork, said 
to be an henge monument, 

[7900-7901]

inside which is a derelict 
Norman church. Carex 
humilis formerly grew on the 
bank, but since the site 
has been possessed by the 
Ministry of Works it has 
become overgrown with tall 
ungrazed grass and could 
not be seen.
There is very litle 
chalk grassland in the Salis-
bury district, all the 
downland now being arable 
save the steepest slopes 
and ancient earthworks.
Old yew trees are fre-
quent in the district. Where 
they stand in pastures, they 
are fenced.
April 1.  (cont. from p. 7854)
There are some fine 
ash-woods in steep hollows 
S.W. of Bullbarrow, in the Dor-
set Downs.
At Cerne Abbas is a 
very vigorous growth of 
Polypodium all over the 
roof of a monastic building, 
forming a close cover. [SYMBOL]ϕ[SYMBOL].
[????]T[????] hares were seen on 
Chesil Beach. One made 
for the Fleet and splashed 
across one end in shallow 
water.
There are a few sarsen 
stones on the coastal 
chalk range behind Portisham.
Portland.
The Isle is a most 
singular formation, mainly 

[7902-7903]

of white limestone, a hori-
zontal slab of which forms 
the top of the Island and 
descends by cliffs about 
150ft high at the N. end 
gradually descending to sea 
level at the Beal. The 
cliffs are precipitous or over-
hanging where the [SYMBOL]^[SYMBOL] soft Jurassic 
strata underneath have been 
eroded, and the island 
thus has a curious resem-
blance to the Chambotte, 
N. of Aix les Bains. It is 
largely treeless and grassy. 
Most of the interior is quarried 
away. Towards the S. end 
about a third of the island 
is cultivated with remarkable 
lynchets which are still in 
use.
Natural vegetation is 
entirely coastal. About 3/4 mile 
N.E. of the Beal is a stretch 
of low cliffs which are 
rather unstable. The 
world poplation of Limonium 
recurvum occurs on rock 
ledges at the extreme 
brow of these cliffs and 
just below, extending for 
some 20 yards along the 
cliffs. Inula crithmoides 
occurs on nearby cliffs 
in similar situations. 
There is marked solefluxion 
in the rubbly deposits, 
about 3ft deep, which over-
lie the cliffs in some pla-
ces. [SYMBOL]ϕ[SYMBOL].

[7904-7905]

In Dr Coombe's garden at 
Homington, Fritillaria Imper-
ialis is coming into flower. 
Epimedium spp have suffered 
severely from frost. The Gew 
Graze juniper retains its 
prostrate habit. Asparagus is 
just coming up. 
Dr Coombe is growing 
Dio[????]a indoors in a pot 
of peat. The plant is as yet 
very small. The young leaves, 
when 1/4in. diam., have 
prominent marginal bristles; 
the facial bristles are colour-
less, just visible with a lens.
Mistletoe is abundant 
on willows at Homington.
The water-meadows in 
the Salisbury valleys are 
traditionally drowned in winter 
by controlled flooding from 
an intricate system of parallel 
watercourses. This is rarely 
done at present as the 
whole system of levels has 
to be set out each year. 
Beech is rare and 
probably always planted in 
the district. 
April 3 (cont. from p. 7864).
Yarnbury Castle.
This gigantic hill-fort 
has some excellent chalk 
grassland. In the ditch 
is a considerable area of 
old juniper scrub, not much 
regenerating. 
About 1 1/2 miles S. of  

[7906-7907]

Homington is Great Yews 
Wood, an almost pure stand 
of yews. 
Ceterach is confined to 
a bridge at Homington. 
The neighbouring farmer 
keeps a flock of Jacob sheep, 
which often graze the 
marshes at the bottom of 
the garden. They are very 
variable in colour, variously 
ring-straked and spotted with 
brown. They usually have 
four horns, but the number 
varies and they are often 
deformed. 
April 4 (cont. [SYMBOL]^[SYMBOL]from p. 78680.
At Tisbury is a gigantic 
pear tree with a trunk 
some 2ft diam. 
The crags around Wookey 
Hole are densely hung with 
ivy, which forms trailers many 
feet in length dangling into 
space.
The Mendip plateau is 
an undulating land, with 
occasional woods, mainly 
rather poor grassland. There 
is a total absence of surface 
water. Small and rather 
uninteresting dolines are 
frequent.
Cheddar Gorge is remar-
kable for its ivied preci-
pices and jagged pinnacles. 
It has fine screes nd 
scree woods.
Burrington Coombe re-
sembles Cheddar Gorge but 

[7908-7909]

is less precipitous. There are 
many yew trees, including a 
fine open hanging yew wood 
on scree. 
April 7. 
Large areas of heath and 
woodland survive between Alder-
shot and Woking.
April 8. [DIAG]
Ranunculus Ficaria is 
flowering abundantly in 
Leckhampton.
April 9.
The Passiflora shows no 
sign of life, though the 
Clematis is starting to 
grow.
Eccremocarpos scaber was 
planted in a box of earth 
mixed with peat and leaf 
mould on April 7. Owing to 
various delays, it was rather 
dried out in its package 
by the time it was planted. 
April 10.
A vey warm sunny 
day.
The great blackberry at 
Coton was trained into 
position. It fruits on the 
old wood; all the old 
shoots are cut out afer 
fruiting, down to the stock.
About 10 p.m. there 
was a very severe storm 
with thunder and lightning. 
Probably 1/4 in. of rain fell in 
10 minutes. Water flooded 
Selwyn Gardens from one 
side to the other, and 

[7910-7911]

flooded some of the paths 
in Leckhampton. The storm 
was very local, however.
April 11.
The swans are on their 
nest in Queens' Grove.
April 12.
Hayley Wood (with the Pages).
The oxlips are still not 
quite at the height of 
their flowering. They are 
unimpressive this year, per-
haps because (as a result 
of the long season) few 
are out at any one time.
Sedum telephium was 
redisovered near the 1966 
coppice area. About 15 
shoots; no in[????] yet. The 
site has become appreciably 
lighter 
through
coppicing.

All the sempervivum 
pots were put out on the 
balcony under a bird net. 
The ducks have reap-
peared in the New Court: 
a drake and two ducks. 
One of the ducks has a 
nest under the windows of A staircase, in the 
same bay as last year.

[7912-7913]

April 14.
Hayley Wood (prospecting for 
Nature Trail).
Lepidozia is showing the 
effects of coppicing: the 
mats are shrivelled and 
whitish at the edges, though 
large areas are still alive. 
Ptilidium is less affected. 
Cornus is abundant in 
the wood throughout, usually 
thin and straggly in shade. 
Ivy occurs as a carpet 
round the bank between 
the triangle and Hayley Lane 
(Post A); otherwise, only on 
certain trees in the wood 
(for instance, one about 50 
yds S.E. of the centre). 
Arctium occurs only in 
Hayley Lane. 
A single oxlip plant was 
found in the E. hedge of 
Hayley Lane just N. of the 
junction of the Mela[????]rum 
hedge. 
Nettles occur in occasional 
patches in the Triangle 
and the adjoining part of 
Hayley Lane, and in the central 
clearing.
There are one or two 
big elms by Hayley Ditch 
next to the 1964 plot.
Elm suckers occur at 
the edge of the great elm 
area, but are always weak 
and suppressed, doubtless by 
shade. 
Prunus spinosa is scarce 
in the wood.

[7914-7915]

Crataegus oxyacanthoides 
is much the commoner sp. 
in the wood; hybrids are 
quite frequent. C. monogyna 
is much commoner in the 
Triangle.
The elms of the elm 
area overtop by many feet 
the few oaks that remain. 
Anemone is fairly well 
distributed in the oxliip and 
intermediate zones. 
Sanicle is very abundant 
in the Triangle; it also occurs 
along Hayley Ditch, in the 
intermediate associations. 
Galeobdolon is locally 
abundant, as in the area 
to the S.E. and S. of the 1966 
plot, with the Scilla-Primula 
association, of which it may 
represent a more shady 
[????]cies.
Arum is abundant with 
oxlip-bluebell, but rarely flowers 
except in the Triangle. 
Lysimachia nummularia 
occurs in the N.E. ride and 
Hayley Ditch Ride, but not 
apparently off rides. 
Both wood violets are 
equally common.
Co[????]opodium is quite 
abundant in the middle 
[????] of Hayley Ditch rides 
and in the N.W. part of 
the 1964 plot. 
Ajuga is associated 
with bluebell-mercury, espe-
cially in lighter areas and on 

[7916-7917]

rides. 
Vicia saepium is frequent 
in grass at the sides of the 
S.E. ride along its whole length.
Ranunculus ficaria is 
abundant in wetter places, 
mainly with oxlips. Diploid, 
without bulbils.
Viburnum lantana is 
scarce. 
The two small Carex 
riparia swamps at Post H 
(N.E. ride) each coincide in 
extent with a ring of poplars. 
The Triangle contains 
many small oaks with 
narrow crowns. Brachypodium 
sylvaticum is abundant, 
though much of the ground 
is still bare.  Ash seedlings 
(mostly about 6 years old) are 
extremely dense. 
There was some snow 
for much of the day; in-
deed, we left Hayley Wood 
in a blizzard. None lay, 
however. 
April 15.
Three Passiflora plants 
(bought in a pot in Cam-
bridge market) were planted 
in a tub. 
April 16.
Dacrymyces deliquescens 
was found still alive on 
rotten wood in Leckhampton.
April 17.
Fulbourne Pit, 514566.
[!!!!]This is a flat-bottomed 

[7918-7919]

pit about 8ft deep. It seems  
to have been recently cleared 
out by the Trust, and the 
vegetation sithed. In it are 
two barrow-like structures, 
probably islands left by 
the diggers, one with two 
poplars, the other with th[????] 
limes.

Its most interesting 
feature, despite the artificial 
surface, is a number of 
springs of considerable size 
in the chalk, which lies just 
beneath the surface, rather 
like the Nine Wells of Great 
Shelford. There are 8 of  
these, with 2 [!!!!] well-de-
fined sources.  Most are 
gathered into a group near 
the N.W. corner of the fen.
The vegetation consists 
mainly of tall semi-aquatics,
Physcomitrium pyriforme 
is abundant on wet earth 
in the S. part of this pit. N[????]S.
