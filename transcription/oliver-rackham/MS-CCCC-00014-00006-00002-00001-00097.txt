Rhine-
field walk
is a part
of the Forest with avenues
of exotics planted among
native woodlands. These in-
clude Sitka Spruce, Coriscan,
Douglas, and Sequoia, all 
of remarkable size. The
Douglas grows into a big
tree, with a wide squarish
crown and a rugged trunk
about 3ft down. Nearby, on
the Christchurch-Lyndhurst 
road, is a belt of Corsican 
the highest in the country,
which reached 130ft some 
years ago.
The Hatchet Pond is 
a curious lake, quite deep

[7878-7879]

but fluctuating.
There are large quantities
of Spartina in the Beaulieu
River.
Pulmonaria longifolia (an-
gustifolia) is very local in
a hedge-bank and at the 
edge of a wood at Newlands,
St Leonnard's. It grows in
otherwise unremarkable mar-
ginal vegetation including
Primroses and Potentilla 
fragariastrum. 
Elm and ash are almost 
absent from the New Forest. 
The New Forest ends 
abruptly at the Wilts border 
on the N. On the W. it 
extends as far as the  
Avon, and continues little 
changed in the Dorset heaths. 
March 22 (cont. from p. 7775). 
Crousa Downs
The fields in the S. apex of 
the Kestlemem's triangle of 
roads, around 766189, are closely 
strewn with weathered gabbro 
boulders, which occupty roughly 
1/8 of the total area. These  
mostly lie flat and project  
up to 3ft out of the 
ground. They are in long-heath 
which is burnt annually, 
some of it having just been 
fired. The fire destroys  
the epiphytes on all but
the top surfaces of the
larger boulders. Consequently
there is a poor development
of lichens, though [!!!!]Rh[????][!!!!] Hedingia

[7880-7881]

is abundant.
At the N. end of these
fields is a pair of gabbro
boulders about 12ft high
standing on edge and leaning
towards each other but
not quite touching. In 
front is a circle [!!!!][????][!!!!] of boulders
probably artificial. Spheenophorus
occurs abundantly on the
big boulders.
March 23 (cont. from p. 7785.)
Lanyon Quoit, the mega-
lithic chamber from a vanished 
long-barrow, is not remarkable
for its epiphytes.
The Porthmeor stream
(p.7777) is a much smaller
and narrower stream than
that at Lanyon Farm, and
runs in a little ravine filled
and concealed with short
tortuous trees, mainly Salix
atrocinerea.
Cam Galva (p.7782) has
a number of flat blocks
of granite on top of parts
of its ridge (in other parts, 
the blocks have fallen 
as the joints are not so
horizontal and vertical and
so much less stable). These 
have small hollows (a[!!!!] few
in. across and deep) dis-
solved out by rain, and
usually filled with water.
At Hayle are extensive 
mud-flats, but without any
well-developed salt-marsh
vegetation.

[7882-7883]

March 24 (cont. from p. 7796).
Around Enys Head (as
around Coverack) there are 
large areas of Prunus scrub 
on seaward-facing slopes.
This forms win-joined
hedge-like masses, rarely
over 3ft high, but intricate 
and impenetrable.
Allium babingtonii is 
frequest in the ravine 
below Poltesco.
The geology of Kennack 
is very complex. The western 
cliffs are mainly serpentine, 
but with several systems of 
dykes; the latter are mainly
gabbro, up to 2ft thick, 
varying in colour and some-
times with fine crystals. The 
serpentine and gabbro, where 
cooled by neighbouring dykes, 
are [????]ally rendered soft and 
easily weathered. Crig-a-tana 
and Cae[????]ve[????]acks (both visited
at ELWS) are serpentine with 
dykes.
In the eastern bay are
small dunes of calcareous
sand composed mainly of
shell fragments. These lie on 
a Pliocene raised beach 
([!!!!] much the same way 
as Upton Towans are on an 
old marine platform). Recent
washing of sand from the 
beach has revealed a peat 
bed with Cladium in the 
eastern bay.
