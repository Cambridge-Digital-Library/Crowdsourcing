   Moorland.        1987
Considerable area on the summit
of Cammenellis. A few acrea
in hollow just N. of Pt 711 (Nine
Maidens Downs). 681372. Also around
Hangman's Barrow.
Porkellis Moor, in the Cober
Valley, appears to be intact.

Manaccan Plum. A rare cultivar
on the wall of a cottage at Carne.
Manaccan Fig-tree.  Has been
coppiced since 1970 - now not
as tall, but much more spreading.
The stool base has not changed 
much. Some stubs, cut recently,
in 1970, are now [????worm] eaten.

Manaccanite. In a low
roadside cliff on the N. side of
Gillan Creek is said to be 
a mannacanite mine - a shift
going some 10 ft in and then
stopping; later used as a cellar
with a door.  Manaccanite is
a titanium ore, found only
in stream depsits - but people
thought they could mine it.
771250
  The lane down to Helford past
Halvose is well constructed be-
tween walls; not quite wide
enough for vehicles.

Cob buildings. Much of Helford 
village is so built, abundant in
Manaccan & St Martin. Usually
[28028-28029]
8028
there is a stone plinth (which
may be the whole lower storey). The
cob usually overhangs the plinth.
