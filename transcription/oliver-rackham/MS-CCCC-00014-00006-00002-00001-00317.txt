Chinese Dinner given by the
Chens (4 Oct.) including
Auricularia approximating to
auricula-judea. Brought from
China in dried state. When 
hydrated and cooked (stir-fried?)
it has a somewhat crisp texture.
Not much flavour.
Sparassis probably crispa. Comes
from China in a dried state, like
a hard rigid sponge, about 1/3 of
its hydrated diameter. Cooked in
a starchy sauce. Has a delicate
rather primrose-like flavour. Tex-
ture rather stiffer than macaroni.
Cream-coloured when cooked.
Sea-cucumber. Comes dried,
abut 3" x 3/4", grey-black, as
[24730-24731]

as hard as wood. It is hydratrd
and the innards removed. The edible
part is the body wall, which has 
the texture, and somwhay of the 
taste, of roast pigskin, but rather
more gelatinous. The tube-feet are
visible when cooked.
