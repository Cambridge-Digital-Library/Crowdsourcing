Chinese Dinner given by the
Chens (4 Oct.) including
Auricularia approximating to
auricula-judea. Brought from
China in dried state. When 
hydrated and cooked (stir-fried?)
it has a somewhat crisp texture.
Not much flavour.
Sparassis probably crispa. Comes
from China in a dried state, like
a hard rigid sponge, about 1/3 of
its hydrated diameter. Cooked in
a starchy sauce. Has a delicate
rather primrose-like flavour. Tex-
ture rather stiffer than macaroni.
Cream-coloured when cooked.
Sea-cucumber. Comes dried,
abut 3" x 3/4", grey-black, as
[24730-24731]

as hard as wood. It is hydratrd
and the innards removed. The edible
part is the body wall, which has 
the texture, and somwhay of the 
taste, of roast pigskin, but rather
more gelatinous. The tube-feet are
visible when cooked.

  The Omnitheater is a special
movie-house with a huge
screen in the form of an inclined
saucer. On it are projected
films through a fish-eye lens,

whole hemisphere.
  A film of abstract designs
generated by computers - mathema-
tical art-forms of moving and
swirling perspective shapes.
  Then a film of the Grand Canyon
and the story of its discovery &
exploration. It is of a variety of
[24802-24803]
4802
rocks including soft limestone.
The landforms are strongly remin-
iscent of the Dolomites (e.g. Sella,
Cooda d'Aritnailes). Pines come
up to the edge of the Canyon in
places. The bottom is largely tree-
less.
The 19th-cent. explorers tried
to descend the Canyon with four
whaleboats and 10 men, the
leader having lost a hand. One
boat & one man were lost. Three
men abandoned the expedition near
the end and were not seen again.
  Magnificent photography, in-
cluding scenes from an aircraft

  I was supposed to be entertained
to dinner beforehand, with Jeni and
4 others. We could not get into the
restaurant intended "because of a
football match". We tried another,
got up to look like a Dublin pub.
Here we managed, with difficulty

to procure drinks, but after 3/4 h
they stil had not provided any
food & we had to walk out. Jeni
and I ended by eating at our
own expense at a Chinese restaurant
after the lecture.

has been grazed and sometimes 
cut for fuel. No stumps or coppice
stools seen.

       Plateau
Typ8icsl structure as odf p.4812.
Sugar Maple. Probably the
commonest tree. Forms nearly
4815
half the big trees in rhe N.W. of
the plateau, more thsn half in the
S.E. Trees are of all ages, from
collapsed remains to saplings.
  Seedlings said to carpet the
ground.
  Sapling usually form a near-
continuous ground cover, persisting
many years in shade.
  Pole-sized trees prob. less prom-
inent than the other classes.
  Full-grown trees of many ages.
They run to about 80 ft high,
2 1/2 dia. Many are pollard-like
at c. 60 ft up through breakage
of top. Many are [????sny] (not the
oldest). Generally rather gnarled
with a combination of frost-crack,
lightning, suaring scars, and
burn-scars st base. They are
[24816-24817]

[DIAG]

said all to be hollow. They
usually break off high in storms
and fall to pieces piecemeal,
not making a big gap. Fallen
4817
trunks quickly disintegrate.
The hollow interiors are said to 
be hybernacula for coons.
No tip-up mounds seen.
Basswood. About 1/4 of the
canopy in the N.W., less in the
S.E. Probsbly slightly

[DIAG]

gregarious. Said all to be T.
americana.

Big trees are as tall as
Acer saccharum but seldom as
thick, may be younger. Perhaps
a few of the younger generation
but as saplings.
Probably about half are sny,
  Most dead trunks break 
off to form volis; the stump
then dies but the tree is
continued by self-coppicing.
Usually the spouts arise before
the main stem has broken; they
may vary widely in size. Self-
coppicing is highly characteristic 
of this tree. The biggest lime
rings are about 4 ft dia. Nearly
always there are at least remains
of the original tree.
  Frost ribs rare.
  No lightning seen.
4819
  Trunks are gnarled.
Quercus rubra.
