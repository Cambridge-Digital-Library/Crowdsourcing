ξ. F. taxifolius On twigs

[TABLE] Evidence of rabbits,
including fresh bur-
rows is abundant.

These are other 
holes used by foxes,
and a group of very
large ones made by badgers.

1. Auricularia auricula judae
Occasional, on elm.

2. Coprinus micaceus
A row on the ground
along a lying pole of
elm.

3. Nectria cinnabarina 
Occasional.

4. Nectria sp. Ash canker
is occasional.

[5702-5703]

5. Ustilina.
Occasional
on elm stumps.

6. Xylaria hypoxylon.
Frequent.

7. Stereum purpureum.
Flourishing on a young
beech cut off about
3ft from the ground.
Mostly resupinate. The 
tree still has some
living [????] on its remain-
ing twigs. Soredia of
a green lichen which
have fallen from the
trunk onto the hyme-
nium are growing.

8.Fomes annosus. A case

of great interest as there are
no conifers in the wood.
Philip Lloyd has an experi-
ment in a small open patch
with hawthorn bushes in
the middle. Some of these
were cut down in the
summer; black zone lines, not
characteristic of this sp., were
found in them, and some 
were moribund. At the same
time two rain gauges
were sunk in the ground
aboit 10ft apart and within 
a few ft of the stumps
and of uncut bushes.
Sporophores have recently 
been developed in both
holes, squeezed between
the rain-gauge and the

[5704-5705]

earth. The largest was
about 2 in. diam, rather
thin, misshapen from the
confined space but with
well-developed tubes and
characteristic colouring.
It had a small living
root embedded in it.

9. Mycena galericulata. Fre-
quent on stumps.

10. Diatrype stigma. On elm
twigs.

Nine wells, [!!!!] Great Shelford.
[TABLE] A small fragment (a few
acres) of unenclosed 
land around the six
watercourses. The only

open land remaining is
in the S.W. corner where
there is a small patch
around the monument.
The rest is covered 
by very large hawthorn
and elder trees, with a 
few small beeches recently
planted.
[TABLE] There is a large Euonymus
bush near the pillar.
[TABLE] Iris foetidissima occurs
in this wood.
[TABLE] The Naturalists' Trust
is cleaning a small area
of wood to extend the
open area around the
monument.
