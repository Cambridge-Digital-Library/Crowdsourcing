a green lichen which
have fallen from the
trunk onto the hyme-
nium are growing.

8.Fomes annosus. A case

of great interest as there are
no conifers in the wood.
Philip Lloyd has an experi-
ment in a small open patch
with hawthorn bushes in
the middle. Some of these
were cut down in the
summer; black zone lines, not
characteristic of this sp., were
found in them, and some 
were moribund. At the same
time two rain gauges
were sunk in the ground
about 10ft apart and within 
a few ft of the stumps
and of uncut bushes.
Sporophores have recently 
been developed in both
holes, squeezed between
the rain-gauge and the

[5704-5705]

earth. The largest was
about 2 in. diam, rather
thin, misshapen from the
confined space but with
well-developed tubes and
characteristic colouring.
It had a small living
root embedded in it.

open land remaining is
in the S.W. corner where
there is a small patch
around the monument.
The rest is covered 
by very large hawthorn
and elder trees, with a 
few small beeches recently
planted.
[TABLE] There is a large Euonymus
bush near the pillar.
[TABLE] Iris foetidissima occurs
in this wood.
[TABLE] The Naturalists' Trust
is clearing a small area
of wood to extend the
open area around the
monument.

December 2.
[TABLE] More hawthorn trees

[5706-5707]

were cut down of Nine 
Wells. The largest , al-
though of venerable appear-
ance, were less than
40 years old. The stumps
were not treated.
[TABLE] A hard frost.
December 3.
[TABLE] Another hard frost,
with fine growths of ice
crystals on trees &c.
December 4.
[TABLE] Another hard frost,
with a misty day without
thawing except in the
sun. The ice crystals
reached about 1/2 in.long.
December 5.
[TABLE] A very hard frost,
but thawing during the

midday. The river is 
thinly frozen above the
Granta weir, [!!!!] at the back
of New Hall, and below
King's Bridge.
December 8.
[TABLE] After a further
intense frost (this and
the previous reaching
II°F.), the river
was frozen about 1/2 in. thick
as far as Queens' Bridge.
Queens' Ditch and King's 
Ditch were heavily frozen,
and there was skating 
on them. The ice
creaked and moved very
slightly when walked on.
December 7.
[TABLE] A slighter frost at

[5708-5709]

night. The lead made
by a punt going up
the river froze over.
Skating continued later
in the day there was
a rapid thaw.
December 8.
[TABLE] The thaw continued
all night. By 11 a.m.,
the ice was still
fairly thick on Queen's
Ditch, and a short
stretch of river in King's
was still completely
frozen.
[TABLE] The leaves of the elms,
which had been killed 
by the intense cold, were
rapidly removed by
a strong wind.

December 26.
[TABLE] A light but prolonged
fall of snow in the
morning left a layer
about 1/2. in. deep.
[TABLE] The pond by the Valley
Drive is dry. A crop of
corn has been taken
from the field by it.
[TABLE] There was a slight
thaw in the afternoon
but a hard frost again
at night.
December 27.
[TABLE] The frost continues,
apart from the a slight thaw

[5718-5719]

in the afternoon. A little
snow fell in the morning.
[TABLE] Gulls, starlings, sparrows 
and a robin have been 
feeding greedily on fat
put out on the back
grass.
December 28.
[TABLE] The river froze over
just above the Cow Tower 
and froze (apart from
small leads along the banks)
at Riverside. The ice
was continuous at Duke
Street bridge, but not

attached to the bank
because of the tide.
Piling operations kept
the water clear at River-
side Road.
December 30.
[TABLE] Snow fell lightly
but continuously between
about 11.30 a.m. and
5 p.m., and was driven 
by a strong east gale.
The more exposed sites
were kept clear, and 
small drifts up to 1ft
deep were formed in the
lee of fences  & c. In
the drive, there were
beautiful transverse dunes,
ornamented with minute
ridges.

[5720-5721]

Only sheltered roofs
were covered, and strong
gusts continually swept
clouds of snow off them.
The small flakes 
found their way into
the garage and coal-
house in small drifts,
and also into ill-fit-
ting windows facing E.,
but not into the summer-
house. Depth on the
back grass about 3 in.
December 31.
[TABLE] Viburnum tinus
at Rockland appears to
have suffered from the
frost.
[TABLE] The great ash affected
by Armillaria in Surlingham

wood came down in a 
gale about a fortnight
ago.
[TABLE] There are many hare
tracks over the fields by
the path. The hares 
seem to have been digging 
in the snow.
[TABLE] Nettles at Hellington
are still standing
with [????] and inf[???]

[TABLE] Heracleum Mante-
gazzianum at Wheat-
fen is beginning to
decay ; most of the
stems have already
fallen.
[TABLE] There has been a

[5722-5723]

very strong E.wind
all day. In the
morning, there were no
deep drifts any-
where in the district,
though ditches were
filled on high ground,
and there was
about 1 ft of snow 
on very exposed parts
of the Hellington B[????]
to Rockland road.
Much of the same 
road was swept 
clear and very slip-
pery with thick clear
ice. The path over
the fields to Wheat-
ten, sunk some 2
ft below the ground

level was filled flush 
with snow. Beautiful,
cornices hung on some
hedges. Most of the
fields were 50%
clear. Rockland 
Broad appeared to 
be entirely frozen,
with snow in patches.
Home Dike was 
almost clear at
the top, and Claxton
Run quite clear
other dikes thickly
iced but sagging in
the middle. No
river ice at the Thope
Station, but a big 
dam of loes is said
to have formed at

[5724-5725]

Coldham Hall
[TABLE] No more snow fell
during the day, but the 
high wind continued all
day, and a big drifts
accumulated. On the
Surlingham-Rockland,
road, along an exposed
hedge, [SYMBOL] (317055) large ones formed
of the cornice type ; they
were some 6ft high and
the talus extended across
the road to about 1ft
deep; it was just passable
for vehicles at 7.30 p.m.
In addition to being iced,
Hellington Hill was almost
blocked by very large
cornices. The road is very
sunk at this point

[DIAG]
[DIAG]
SECTION OF CORNICE DRIFT 
[TABLE](vertical scale somewhat 
exaggerated
and bordered by hedges.
The cornice consists of
a firm compact top,
starting about 1ft lower
than the hedge and 
slightly rising outwards
to an abrupt cliff

[5726-5727]

edge, which is always
present though rarely
exceeding 1 ft high and
sometimes only a fraction
of an inch. There is 
a long [SYMBOL] loose talus slope,
in this case extending
right across the road.
There is an abrupt
junction, usually with 
a little crevasse, where
the talus meets the
cliff. It is not clear
how this structured is
formed. Clouds of snow
blow off the edge of
the cliff, but the cliff
face appears to be
perfectly stable. The
whole structure appears

to grow outwards from
the hedge.
[TABLE] On the exposed
ground at the top of the
hill (314029) the dune
drifts were much larger,
covering the road to a
depth of 2ft, deeper
in places. This type
consists of long gentle
ridges coming through
gaps in a hedge in
the direction of the
wind.
[TABLE] Cornices of varying
size lined most of the
road from Hellington to
Trowse Fork, especially
in the Claxton Valley.
The road was in

[5728-5729]

places only just pas-
sable for vehicles. The
lowest of[????]t[????] bus was de-
layed 1 1/2 hours being
stuck in drifts near
Loddon.
[TABLE] On the Howerston-
- Yelverton heights, the
wind was blowing
a lot of snow into
the air, and electric
pylons were shorting.
Flashes played round 
the insulators, each
consisting of a num-
ber of beads of dis-
charge, doubtless due
to ice bridges across
the insulator rings.
The discharges were

momentary accom-
panied by crackling.
[TABLE] All the coypus
are said to be dead,
partly from cold and 
partly from starvation.
The guinea-pigs 
are left outside in
their hutch, and do
not seem to mind the
weather.
[TABLE] The Claxton Run
is still almost free
of ice.
[TABLE] Sorbus aucuparia

[TABLE] The snow is ra-
pidly disappearing

[TABLE] There are no
large drifts in Mouse
hold, though cornius
some 2ft deep have
formed on Heartsease
Lane. The N.side
of St James's spur
is almost bare.
[TABLE] Not much river
ice at Riverside
Road, due to spring
tides and piling ope-
rations. The river is 
quite frozen, over
at St George's pool
and downstream to-

wards Fye Bridge
with swans standing
on the thick ice. The
edges of the ice ex-
tend right up to the
piling, but there is 
always a marginal 
crack doubtless due
to the tide.
January 2.
[TABLE] The road from
Norwich to Cambridge 
via Kenninghall is
almost free from 
drifts, owing to its
orientation. There
have been dunes
of perhaps 2ft thick
near New Buckenham,
and cornices in

[5732-5733]

the sunk road at
Garbolsham. There
are small roadside
cornices in many
places between
Bury and Newmarket.
Many of the trans-
verse roads, espe-
cially in that dis-
trict , are filled up
flush.
[TABLE] About 6 in. of snow
has fallen in Cam-
bridge, rather more 
than at Norwich and
much more evenly
distributed. The river
is frozen to a con-
siderable depth ; the 
surface is rather too

rough for skating, but
a bike was seen on
the ice under Garrett
Hostel Bridge and a 
man walked out into
the middle from Clare
Fellow's Garden. A little
snow fell during the
day.
Several [DIAG]
tracks on Leck- [DIAG]
hampton lawn [DIAG]
suggest hares.[DIAG]
The stride is [DIAG]
as much as [DIAG]
5ft.[DIAG]
[TABLE] The pool at [DIAG]
Leckhampton is thick-
ly frozen and was
walked on.

[5734-5735]

[TABLE] There are no reports
of burst pipes in the 
College, but the water 
is turned off. The
bath downpipe out-
side my window is
blocked.
January 3. [DIAG]
[TABLE] There was a slight
thaw during the day.
[TABLE] The Granta Pool
is frozen over and
was cautiously walked
on. The branch flow-
ing into it from the
bathing place is clear.
The Anchor Pool is
clear ; the ice ex-
tends as far as 
Silver Street bridge,

New Hall, and to
within a few yards
of the mill-race.
January 4.
[TABLE] A slight fall of snow
in the morning, which
soon turned to rain.
The temperature re-
mained well below freez-
ing, and all objects
soon became coated
with ice : roads, cars,
walls, posts, lamp
standards, trunks and
branches of trees.
Many evergreen trees
were endangered by
ice forming on both
sides of their leaves.
When removed, then

[5736-5737]

ice formed a good
impression of the leaf.
Ice casts could be
thus obtained of whole
shoots of yew complete
with needles. Deciduous
trees were sheathed
in ice from trunks
to twigs, owing to
the fireness of the
rain. Cars looked as
if varnished, with 
frozen trickles running
down. The ice layer
was 1/2 in. thick on
wall-tops ; but usu-
ally much thinner. At
night a thaw set in,
but the thicker casings
were not affected.

Two gray squirrels
were seen on the same
tree in Leckhampton,
in the chestnut avenue.
[TABLE] The children's bathing
pool was walked on.
[TABLE] At Norwich and
here, there has been 
very little snow on 
buildings and trees,
doubtless because of
wind.
January 5.
[TABLE] The thaw continued,
becoming more gradual.
[TABLE] The snow now has
an ice crust which in
some places can be
walked on with care
without going through.

[5738-5739]

[TABLE] The ice has begun
to go from the river,
almost entirely by
melting from below.
[TABLE] The snow on Grant-
chester, Meadows is
about 1 1/2 ft deep in
hollows. There is not
much ice, owing to the
not very high water
table, but all the dykes
are passable on frost.
[TABLE] The Grantchester 
road has been con-
siderably encumbered
by snow. A drift about
1 1/2ft  deep was seen
in the middle of the vil-
lage. Cornices up to
3ft high line the

roadfrom the end of 
the village to the first
playing fields. They
rarely have a well-de-
veloped cliff face. The
road appears to have
been drifted over at
the top of the hill.
The ditch has been
filled up flush almost
as far as the Barton 
Road junction.
January 6.
[TABLE] The thaw has al-
most stopped. Most
of the ice has melted
on the river, except
between Magdalene and
Jesus and detached
floes elsewhere.

[5740-5741]

A search was made
for soil structures in
the district. Conditions
were poor : uneven de-
position of snow due
to drifting, and insuf-
ficient melting.
[TABLE] At Grantchester,
there are some ridges
running N. and S. on
a roughtly level field
at 433 561, to the S. of
the road. They appear
to be cultivation ridges,
like those in Grantchester 
Meadows. Most of the 
fields in the Fulbourn
district are irregularly
marked, doubtless because
of irregular micro-relief

and drifting factors.
An exception is one at
525554, which shows
stripes running N.W-S.E,
with the contours. These
are probably cultivation
ridges. At Fleam Dike,
in the big field 551542
there is no trace of
the complex system
of trackway markings
sometimes visible in
the crop, but only
faint and wholly irregu-
lar marks. The field
N.-W. of Worstead Lodge,
526563, shows promi
-nent roundish spots,
but as it is sloping
these can hardly be

[5742-5743]

polygons. In the Granta
Valley, the only notable
phenomenon seen was a
similar one in the field
on Littletrees Hill (492
530).
January 7.
[TABLE] A slight fall of snow.
[TABLE] The thaw continued
slowly. Large ice floes
became detached from
the river bank.
January 8.
[TABLE] A hard frost which 
just froze the sur-
face of the river. The
weather turned sunny,
but the ice did not 
melt entirely.
[TABLE] A hard crust has

formed on the snow. In
Leckhampton, it can be
walked on with care in
places.
January 9.
[TABLE] Another hard frost
followed by sunshine.
January 10.
[TABLE] The branch of the
river which runs through
the children's pool was
walked along. The ice
was thick, but creaked in places. Se-
veral skaters were out.
This branch presents 
a curious appearance 
where it passes under
the Bishop's mill-race ;
the water has sunk

[5744-5745]

from under the ice,
and the mill is jammed
with slabs of ice up
to 4 in. thick.
[TABLE] The S.end of Cru-
soe's Island, beyond
the road bridge, was
explored by crossing
on the ice. The pollard
willow at the tip is
unusually large but
not otherwise remarkable.
[TABLE] The middle of
Crusoe's Island was
explored over the ice,
but nothing remarkable
was found.
[TABLE] The Granta pool
is frozen over, and the
fast stream that runs

into it from the bathing
pools is beginning to
freeze.
[TABLE] The river is hardly
strong enough to walk in.
[TABLE] The weather was
sunny with a shower
of snow.
January 11.
[TABLE] Sunny weather again
followed a hard frost
(19°F at Harlton). There 
was a little snow.
[TABLE] The river was crossed
on the ice at King's.
About 200 skaters were
out. The ice was thick 
and clear, but moved
slightly when persons
passed and was badly

[5746-5747]

cracked near the banks.
The ice was thin 
under the bridges.
There were a few
skaters out opposite
Trinity Hall ; and
somebody went out
at Coe Fen, but the 
ice there was hardly
thick enough. The
Granta pool was
also used.
[TABLE] The stream running
into the Granta pool 
is frozen over. The
ice does not extend
upstream of Silver street
bridge.
[TABLE] The ice of a 
small dyke on Sheep's

Green was examined.
It was just weak
enough to fall through.
There was about 2 in
thick of compact ice,
not solid but with air
pockets. Under this were
blades of ice extending
about 1 1/2 in. downwards and
forming an irregular 
spongy structure full of
water.
[TABLE] Abundant ice crystals
formed on solid objects
during the night.
[TABLE] There is little river
ice at Norwich.
January 12. [TABLE] [DIAG]64 H.L[DIAG]
A thin layer of snow
fell in the night.

[5748-5749]

[TABLE] The river froze 
thinly above Bishop Bridge.
[TABLE] The garden is still
snow-covered. Gulls,
blackbirds, starlings, spar-
rows, robins and tits devour
fat &c.

[TABLE] A lime tree at the
entrance to Valley Drive 
appears to be still
alive, the bark having
been taken off some
years ago for several
in. all round the trunk
except for a strip about
1 in. wide. There is great
regeneration of phloem

over the cut surface.
[TABLE] Nectria grows on
the trunk of an apparently
living Cercis some 10ft
high in Gooseberry Gar-
dens.
January 13.
[TABLE] Further slight snow-
fall. There is now
about 1 in. of new snow
[TABLE] Many dead bees 
were found among the
snow on the alighting
board and for about
5 yards around the hive.
[TABLE] A bottle of mills,
when seen at 9 a.m.,
had the cap carried
up on a pillar of ice
projecting about 3/4 in.

from the mouth? The
bottow was neatly 
cracked off. The contents
were almost solid, tho'
there was a small
trickle from the crack.
[TABLE] A large Alsatian hound
scavenges in gardens.
January 14.
[TABLE] The river at River-
side was entirely frozen
over this morning, with
a light covering of snow,
and a gap about 
1 in. at the edge.
There was rather less
ice at Riverside Road.
[TABLE] The Yare is largely
frozen, though with several
gaps. The Tas is mainly

clear. The Little Ouse
is quite clear. Eriswell
Lode and Mildenhall
Drain are completely frozen.
The Great Ouse at Ely
is entirely and thickly
frozen and has been
skated on.
[TABLE] Countless rabbit and
have tracks have been
seen in the snow, par-
ticularly in the breck
and around Ely. In
the N.E breck, the
around is completely
covered with footmarks
on the ploughed strip just
inside the "rabbit-proof"
fence of the forest.

[5752-5753]

[TABLE] The tarmack pave-
ment at the Heartsease 
has been lifted and
cracked by the frost.
[TABLE] Some flagstones on the
N.side of the New Court
have been raised nearly
1 in. by solefluxion.

Artichokes [TABLE] c. 1 lb

[TABLE] A small hole was
dug with hammer and
chisel in the frozen
ground of the back
border, under a coton-
easter bush. The ground
was frozen solid to
a depth of 6 1/2 in, under
2 in. of snow. the earth

contained small lenses
of ice crystals. the
depth on open wind-
swept land must be
at least 1ft.
January 15. [TABLE] [DIAG]
[TABLE] The ice is now 
bearable from about 
100 yards N.of Magdalene
Bridge (where a factory 
discharges hot water)
to Queens' Bridge, though
it is rather week in
Queens'. The three-
arched bridges are
all rather weak and
the middle arches are
partly unfrozen (rather
surprising). The one-arch
bridges are frozen up,

[5754-5755]

though all of them did
so somewhat later than
the open water, and the
Bridge of sighs is 
still rather weak.
The ice is cracked 
in many places, es-
pecially under bridges, but
does not move. The
Anchor Pool remains un-
frozen. The upper river
is frozen almost down
to the weirs, and is
bearrable.

[TABLE] In the night and
early morning, a very
strong N.E. wind ; it has 
rarely been so cold.
The wind later shifted 
to S., but it remained
well below freezing.
[TABLE] A lot of sand has
blown over the old

snow in the N.E. Breck.
[TABLE] There was a slight
snowfall during the night,
but owing to the wind
it settled in a few places 
only up to 6 in. deep.
[TABLE] The ground was found
to be frozen to a depth
of 6 in. under about 3/4 in.
of firn between the Tirolese
trees in the N.border,
and to the same depth
under 2 1/2 in. of snow at
the N.W. corner of the
rose garden. In the
latter place, lenses of ice
crystals were found in the
top 2 in.

[TABLE] Very little ice has 
formed on the river of
Norwich, though there
is a thin coating right
across at Riverside 
and above Bishop Bridge.
[TABLE] Difts have formed
all along the line from
Norwich to the Fens,
mainly of the comice
type, most pronounced 
in shallow cuttings. They
covered the line near
Wymondham and in
much of the breck (not
Bridgeham Heath, where
the heather holds snow).

[!!!!] [TABLE] An average of about
4 in. of snow has fallen
