1. Auricularia auricula judae
Occasional, on elm.

2. Coprinus micaceus
A row on the ground
along a lying pole of
elm.

3. Nectria cinnabarina

[5702-5703]

5. Ustilina.
Occasional
on elm stumps.

6. Xylaria hypoxylon.
Frequent.

7. Stereum purpureum.
Flourishing on a young
beech cut off about
3ft from the ground.
Mostly resupinate. The 
tree still has some
living [????] on its remain-
ing twigs. Soredia of
a green lichen which
have fallen from the
trunk onto the hyme-
nium are growing.

8.Fomes annosus. A case

of great interest as there are
no conifers in the wood.
Philip Lloyd has an experi-
ment in a small open patch
with hawthorn bushes in
the middle. Some of these
were cut down in the
summer; black zone lines, not
characteristic of this sp., were
found in them, and some 
were moribund. At the same
time two rain gauges
were sunk in the ground
aboit 10ft apart and within 
a few ft of the stumps
and of uncut bushes.
Sporophores have recently 
been developed in both
holes, squeezed between
the rain-gauge and the

[5704-5705]

earth. The largest was
about 2 in. diam, rather
thin, misshapen from the
confined space but with
well-developed tubes and
characteristic colouring.
It had a small living
root embedded in it.

9. Mycena galericulata. Fre-
quent on stumps.

10. Diatrype stigma. On elm
twigs.

Nine wells, [!!!!] Great Shelford.
[TABLE] A small fragment (a few
acres) of unenclosed 
land around the six
watercourses. The only

open land remaining is
in the S.W. corner where
there is a small patch
around the monument.
The rest is covered 
by very large hawthorn
and elder trees, with a 
few small beeches recently
planted.
[TABLE] There is a large Euonymus
bush near the pillar.
[TABLE] Iris foetidissima occurs
in this wood.
[TABLE] The Naturalists' Trust
is cleaning a small area
of wood to extend the
open area around the
monument.

December 2.
[TABLE] More hawthorn trees

[5706-5707]

were cut down of Nine 
Wells. The largest , al-
though of venerable appear-
ance , were less than
40 years old. The stumps
were not treated.
[TABLE] A hard frost.
December 3.
[TABLE] Another hard frost,
with fine growths of ice
crystals on trees &c.
Decenber 4.
[TABLE] Another hard frost,
with a misty day without
thawing except in the
sun. The ice crystals
reached about 1/2 in.long.
December 5.
[TABLE] A very hard frost,
but thawing during the

midday. The river is 
thinly frozen above the
Granta weir, [!!!!] at the back
of New Hall, and below
King's Bridge.
December 8.
[TABLE] After a further
intense frost (this and
the previous reaching
II°F.), the river
was frozen about 1/2 in. thick
as far as Queens' Bridge.
Queens' Ditch and King's 
Ditch were heavily frozen,
and there was skating 
on them. The ice
creaked and moved very
slightly when walked on.
December 7.
[TABLE] A slighter frost at

[5708-5709]

night. The lead made
by a punt going up
the river froze over.
Skating continued later
in the day there was
a rapid thaw.
December 8.
[TABLE] The thaw continued
all night. By 11 a.m.,
the ice was still
fairly thick on Queen's
Ditch, and a short
stretch of river in King's
was still completely
frozen.
[TABLE] The leaves of the elms,
which had been killed 
by the intense cold, were
rapidly removed by
a strong wind.

[5710-5711]

[TABLE] At the foot of the

the lake, is a small 
moribund horsechestnut
with signs of Armillaria
about 3ft from the ground.
A dead pine, with no
pathological symptoms, is
a few feet away.

[TABLE] A large branch fell
from one of the elms 
in Trinity Piece, a medium-
sized old tree not re-
cently pollarded.The
branch was much de-
cayed with a squamosus
type rot from a knot-hole
at the base.
