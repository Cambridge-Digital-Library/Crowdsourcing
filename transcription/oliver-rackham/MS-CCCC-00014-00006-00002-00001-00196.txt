Papworth Wood cont.
19[SYMBOL]71
Elm A
(Old), (mature), [SYMBOL] poles [SYMBOL], (suckers)
Suckers (+).
Tk straight
Sk fluted
Bran. ascending, elbowed.
Tw. not thin, subpinnate
Lvs. sl. concave, nearly all
fallen.
Epic. few, in 2 rows.

No wet-wood or Dutch elm
disease seen in any of the
clones. Occasional dead trees
apparently due to shadig.
Trees beyond the wood-bank
at the N.W. corner of the wood
are partly dead, perhaps due to
waterlogging or poisoning by

the ditch, which is an overflow
from Papworth Hospital rubbish
top and smells of carbolic.
Most of the elms of all
three [!!!!]coppice[!!!!] are once-cuts
from a clear felling. Usually
only one pole per stump, oc-
casionally more. Most of the
trees must have been c. 9 in.
dia. at felling. One large
tree of A exists; this is broken
at the top and probably escaped
cutting fro this reason.
Two giant elms just outside
the wood, probably the remains
of a hedge, appear to be B and
are perhaps the origin of that
clone. Bark very thick Fluted
reticulations are due to a suc-

5361

cession of 3-4 successive
layers which have cracked 
in different directions. Each
layer consists of about 8 rhyti-
domes.
All three elm clones are
evenaged stands with very
little understorey. Ash and
maple frequent in mixture.
One birch.
Oak frequent, mever
dominant but coexisting
with the elms (some tendency
to be overtopped, but as yet
none of the oaks is going 
back). Poles evidently of
the same age as the elms.
About 2/3 of the oak poles
are maidens, 1/3 coppice.

[15362-15363]
5362
Maiden oaks occur in small
groups. One 1-year seedling seen.
Oak stumps frequent, in
about the same condition as
those in Hayley.
No acorns lying.

D.E.C. found Lepidozia
reptans in quantity on an oak
stump.
Dryopteris dilatata ([SYMBOL]) [????]
in several places usually on
oak stumps or stools.
One sapling yew about 
6 ft high near the N.E. corner.
Iris foetidissima found
by             . One sterile tuft
near the N.E. corner.
Honeysuckle curiously

5363
local.
Glechoma is usually the
apparent ground dominant.
Deschampsia local.

Features (cf p. 9029-30).
12. Wood-bank very well
developed on the N. (espe-
cially where it does not
ab[????] on the stream) but
remarkably slight elsewhere.
13. Evidence of acid vegetation:
(a) Area with bluebell &
primroses & not much else.
(b) Mnium hornum on
ground well away from stools.
(c) Oak regeneration. (d) Brambles.
These features are wide -
spread but particularly

[15364-15365]
5364

concentrated in the N.E.
corner.
14. Oak regeneration from
seed much the nest in W.
Cambs.
15. Elms form a tight strand
excluding most other vege-
tation.
16. Middles of the wetness
range.
17. Remarkable sharp
boundaries between elm
clones, the best seen this 
year.

Possible historical sequence:
(a) Medieval Papworth Wood.
(b) Emparked (explains boun-
dary irregularities and ab-

5365
sence of wood-banks on E.
and S.W.).
(c) Grazing eliminates most
of the ancient woodland
plants (leaving Crataegus
oxy., Viola reich., Hyperic.
hirs., Ranunc. auric., [!!!!]all[!!!!] most
of which are rare).
(d) N.E. third of park be-
comes mixed coppice within
a larger park (hence
truncation boundary to S.W.).
Remainder of park is further
cleared and becomes site
of Hall and gardens.
(e) Elm invasion.
(F) Felling in 1930s promotes 
elm at the expense of most
remaining features of the

[15366-15367]

5366
old wood.

Papworth Agnes
Barn-field Lane contains 
several ancient closes of
pasture with a variety of
pollarded and other elms.

There appears to be no
elm disease in either Papworth.

October 31.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).

Four deer were seen just
inside the Wood on the S. side
of the E. Section. 
A large stag with antlers
in velvet was seen alone

5367
in the E. Section near Post
F. All these deer were seen
close to and made off at some
leisure.
The trenches in Hayley
Lane are partly filled in.

Elm Records.
"Hayley Lane S." is what
used to be thought to be
Ulmus glabra.
The Hayley Lane hedge just
N. of the B1046 consists for
a few yards of an elm of
leaf-fall class 5. Further N.
it reverts to elm of leaf-fall
class 1, [!!!!]be[!!!!] with a[!!!!]n[!!!!] few trees
of 5.
