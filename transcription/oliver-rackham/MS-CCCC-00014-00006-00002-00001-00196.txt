Epic. few, in 2 rows.

No wet-wood or Dutch elm
disease seen in any of the
clones. Occasional dead trees
apparently due to shadig.
Trees beyond the wood-bank
at the N.W. corner of the wood
are partly dead, perhaps due to
waterlogging or poisoning by

the ditch, which is an overflow
from Papworth Hospital rubbish
top and smells of carbolic.
Most of the elms of all
three [!!!!]coppice[!!!!] are once-cuts
from a clear felling. Usually
only one pole per stump, oc-
casionally more. Most of the
trees must have been c. 9 in.
dia. at felling. One large
tree of A exists; this is broken
at the top and probably escaped
cutting fro this reason.
Two giant elms just outside
the wood, probably the remains
of a hedge, appear to be B and
are perhaps the origin of that
clone. Bark very thick Fluted
reticulations are due to a suc-

5361

cession of 3-4 successive
layers which have cracked 
in different directions. Each
layer consists of about 8 rhyti-
domes.
All three elm clones are
evenaged stands with very
little understorey. Ash and
maple frequent in mixture.
One birch.
Oak frequent, mever
dominant but coexisting
with the elms (some tendency
to be overtopped, but as yet
none of the oaks is going 
back). Poles evidently of
the same age as the elms.
About 2/3 of the oak poles
are maidens, 1/3 coppice.

[15362-15363]
5362
Maiden oaks occur in small
groups. One 1-year seedling seen.
Oak stumps frequent, in
about the same condition as
those in Hayley.
No acorns lying.

D.E.C. found Lepidozia
reptans in quantity on an oak
stump.
Dryopteris dilatata ([SYMBOL]) [????]
in several places usually on
oak stumps or stools.
One sapling yew about 
6 ft high near the N.E. corner.
Iris foetidissima found
by             . One sterile tuft
near the N.E. corner.
Honeysuckle curiously

local.
Glechoma is usually the
apparent ground dominant.
Deschampsia local.

Features (cf p. 9029-30).
12. Wood-bank very well
developed on the N. (espe-
cially where it does not
ab[????] on the stream) but
remarkably slight elsewhere.
13. Evidence of acid vegetation:
(a) Area with bluebell &
primroses & not much else.
(b) Mnium hornum on
ground well away from stools.
(c) Oak regeneration. (d) Brambles.
These features are wide -
spread but particularly

[15364-15365]
5364

concentrated in the N.E.
corner.
14. Oak regeneration from
seed much the nest in W.
Cambs.
15. Elms form a tight strand
excluding most other vege-
tation.
16. Middles of the wetness
range.
17. Remarkable sharp
boundaries between elm
clones, the best seen this 
year.

Possible historical sequence:
(a) Medieval Papworth Wood.
(b) Emparked (explains boun-
dary irregularities and ab-

5365
sence of wood-banks on E.
and S.W.).
(c) Grazing eliminates most
of the ancient woodland
plants (leaving Crataegus
oxy., Viola reich., Hyperic.
hirs., Ranunc. auric., [!!!!]all[!!!!] most
of which are rare).
(d) N.E. third of park be-
comes mixed coppice within
a larger park (hence
truncation boundary to S.W.).
Remainder of park is further
cleared and becomes site
of Hall and gardens.
(e) Elm invasion.
(F) Felling in 1930s promotes 
elm at the expense of most
remaining features of the

[15366-15367]

5366
old wood.

Papworth Agnes
Barn-field Lane contains 
several ancient closes of
pasture with a variety of
pollarded and other elms.

There appears to be no
elm disease in either Papworth.

October 31.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).

Four deer were seen just
inside the Wood on the S. side
of the E. Section. 
A large stag with antlers
in velvet was seen alone

5367
in the E. Section near Post
F. All these deer were seen
close to and made off at some
leisure.
The trenches in Hayley
Lane are partly filled in.

Elm Records.
"Hayley Lane S." is what
used to be thought to be
Ulmus glabra.
The Hayley Lane hedge just
N. of the B1046 consists for
a few yards of an elm of
leaf-fall class 5. Further N.
it reverts to elm of leaf-fall
class 1, [!!!!]be[!!!!] with a[!!!!]n[!!!!] few trees
of 5.

SE & SE corner elms meet
only narrowly, as poles, and 
do not overlap.
SE elm is much less ag-
gressive than E or SE corner,
and mingles with other trees.
Mainly on the wood bank.
The S.E. corner elm extends
only a few yards into the
hedge that runs to the S.
The rest of this hedge is an
elm now leafless.

N.W. elm moderately aggressive,
overtopping oaks.
Triangle 2: leave med. size, rather
narrow. A small clone of 3-4
trees among Triangle 1.
Triangle 1 comprises most
of the elms in the S. part
of the Triangle; possibly also
those around Post M and in the
1971 plot. Presumably orig-
inates from the giant trees
now fallen. Very unaggressive
except into the Triangle.
The Triangle contains at
least two other elm clones.

Wet-wood of Ash. Φ9
One pole from a small
stool in the mid-NE region of
the current coppice plot. Pole
5 1/4" dia. over bark. One 
other pole from this stool,
apparently unaffected.
Wet-wood ridge 5/8" high,
3/4" wide.

[DIAG]

5373
Extending from c. 4ft to c.
7 ft from the ground, petering
out at both ends. Healed
over, no recent exudation.
The pole was felled at
base and a section imme-
diately cut from the middle 
with a chain-saw. Copious
flow from a cavity of brown
watery liquid. Pronounced lac-
tic smell later distinctly
carbolicky.
The main crack extending
into the ridge is up to 7 mm
wide. Numerous fine cracks.
Water-soaked region sharply
defined, dark chestnut brown,

[15374-15375]
5374
[DIAG]

around all the cracks except 
the main one, which extends
slightly beyond it into the ridge.

5375

1894 ± 3: first year's growth.
- 1908: rather fast, variable.
- 1942: slow decline.
- 1957: very slow.
- 1971: v.v. slow.

History of disease:
[!!!!]19[!!!!] Late 1961. Large shake sud-
denly splits trunk from pith
to surface and opens to c. 5 mm
wide. Copious stem flux (still
visible in band of dead
Protococcus). (Other shakes
never reach surface, though
some of them reach into post-
-1961 wood.)
1962. Crack remains open
and is bridged by callus and
new wood, [!!!!]tales[!!!!] forming the

[15376-15377]
5376
[DIAG]

beginnings of a ridge. This 
probably continues to heal
without disruption until [!!!!]196[!!!!]
late 1966.
Late 1966. Ridge splits again
as original crack widens to
6 mm.

5377
1967-1969. Crack heals over
without closing, adding to the
height of the ridge.
1970-71. Crack heals over
again following a further
disruption which widens the 
original cracks to 7 mm.
Seven bark ridges are
visible on each side of the
ridge. These are presumably
annual. They may be due
to bark expansion produced
by rapid growth of wood in
the ridge. Or (more likely)
they show that there were
minor reopenings of the fissure
in years other than the
major openings of 1961, 1967,
and 1969.

[15378-15379]
5378
No crown symptoms.
At stool level the pole
shows only black-heart, not 
wetwood. The disease pro-
bablly entered through a
large branch scar in the 
crown, which is black and
waterlogged.
Crickets are frequent in 
tall vegetation in Great Glade.
Some children who joined
the work-party were sent to 
find out what proportion of
oaks in the Wood has acorns
under them. 43 with acorns,
43 [sic] without.
Ash poles are often black
hearted but no other wetwood

5379
was seen in coppicing.
3 pole-sized oaks in 
the 1972 plot.

1. Armillaria mellea. Much
less frequent than in Buff
Wood.

2. A small tuft, apparently on
the ground (? buried wood).
A small Pholiota, pale
yellow-tawny, with dark innate
scales to P. and S. Edge of
P. with white remains of v.
Inocybe (Pholiota) terrigena.

There are now 4 plants of
Carex pendula.
Several of the minor rides
