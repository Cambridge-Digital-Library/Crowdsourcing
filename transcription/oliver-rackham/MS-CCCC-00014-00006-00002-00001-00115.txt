Similar vegetation with
big ash stools, extends down

Orchard.  Many apple, pear,
and plum trees.  Pear trees
quite as high as the 
canopy.  Apple and plum
trees less overgrown.
Dense stand of birches,
young ash, Cornus, Croxy.
&c.  Mercury & primrose
sparse.  Surrounded by old
wood but not mixed with
it.
This orchard is quite
recently abandoned:  a
ruinous shed still stands
beside it.
At the foot of the slope
is a tract of marshy
groubnd (below Barrow Ride)
with abundant nettles.
Large ash stools occur
[8808-8809]
8808
here also.
There is a 
considerable area of
scrub (Prunus spin-
osa, &c., now old
and decrepit)
alongside Leeds ride.
Barrow Ride runs
quite steeply uphill
and seems to be
an old field boun-
dary drift8
Bevill's Wood
is much more 
level.  It contained
a three-storeyed
coppice with standards, in-
cluding many big ash
stools.  It has now been
mostly cleared or drastically
8809
[DIAG]
thinned by the Forestry Com-
mission.
The big ash stools in Monks'
Wood are like those in Hayley, but
lower;  often quite healed over at top.

The Wood was visited
about 11 p.m. on a still
warm night.  Many small 
noises but little continued
activity:  perhaps the traffic
on the A1 prevents animals 
from coming out earlier.
8813
Carex pendula is re-
markably common in the
Wood.
There is a very thick tall
thorn hedge between the Ex-
perimental station and the
road.
March 21. Monks' Wood.
Two crab trees were
seen along the S.W. edge of the
wood.
The join onto the Old
Quarter is by no means
obvious.
Quarter Ride appears 
to be quite new:  it cuts
across ridge and furrow.
Service Ride is not visible.
Carex riparia is not fre-
quent, but occurs near B".

oak stools in the Wood

To the E. of East Field is
a dense area of thorn scrub
with few standards or
large coppice.
[8816-8817]
8816
East Field tends to be-
come overgrown and
has been flailed recently.
The Wood was visited
about 10.30 p.m. (Barrow
Ride- lakes - Main Ride
-Stocking-close Ride). Few
animals were stirring
(despite the full moon).
Pigeons were a nuisance
as they flew off very
noisily when approached.
The weather has been
very warm and hazy in
the daytime, and warm
& clear at night.

Ebbor Gorge
There is a fibe badger sett
on steep earthern slope above
the gorge on the E. side near
the entrance. Under elms,
elder, and venerable hazels.
4 occupied holes.  Bedding
thrown out.  Many worn  back
leading into the gorge at the
surrounding grassland.  Nettles ab.
Hazels frequently have
few trunks from a base,
to 8 in. diam., with smooth
bark later cracking like
Betula pubescens.

Chrysosplenium grows

This is a thick mat of
bryophytes on medium-sized
stable scree on a N.W. facing
slope.  Crust of humus covers
the boulders but does not
penetrate between them.  The
bryophyte mat thins out at
the edges and merges with
adjacent loose bare scree.

On the Ebbor Rocks them-
selves in the narrow ravine
there is little bare rock.  Tham-
nium forms a closed stand on
vertical faces.  Radula is densely
and closely oppressed to rock 
surfaces.
8853
Lecidea calcarea
Grows over all other crustose
lichens save Verrucaria
Glaucina, which it grows
over very slowly leaving
islands.  Occasionally has a sector
of a different colour - [SYMBOL]
Lecidea has very small
oblong apothecia which
become very sunken by the
overgrowth of the thallus
The latter is surprisingly
thick.
Verrucaria glauceria was
found only in the middle
of Lecidea calcarea, but
nonetheless appears to be a
relict plant not yet grown
over.
The maximum size of
Lecidea on small glaciated outcrops
to the S.E. of the gorge is 8 m.

[8854-8855]
8854
S.E. Ash woods F
Ash very uneven aged
A few old trees, but no sign
of coppice.
Hazels few and thin.
Oaks few but large.
ground flora mainly a car-
pet of mercury.  Bluebells fre-
quent.  Other ground flora
poor.
The upper end of the
gorge is surrounded by open
grassland with occasional
rock outcrops, some of which
contain large rounded lumps
of chert embedded in the
limestone.
Most of the woods in the gorge
are of the types described, but they
are often thin and there is much
open space.  Probably formerly grazed,
