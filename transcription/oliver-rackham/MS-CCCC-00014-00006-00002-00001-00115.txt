continuous.

Ground flat, but no sign

Similar vegetation with
big ash stools, extends down
the slope as far as Barrow Ride.
8807
Orchard.  Many apple, pear,
and plum trees.  Pear trees
quite as high as the 
canopy.  Apple and plum
trees less overgrown.
Dense stand of birches,
young ash, Cornus, Croxy.
&c.  Mercury & primrose
sparse.  Surrounded by old
wood but not mixed with
it.
This orchard is quite
recently abandoned:  a
ruinous shed still stands
beside it.
At the foot of the slope
is a tract of marshy
groubnd (below Barrow Ride)
with abundant nettles.
Large ash stools occur
[8808-8809]
8808
here also.
There is a 
considerable area of
scrub (Prunus spin-
osa, &c., now old
and decrepit)
alongside Leeds ride.
Barrow Ride runs
quite steeply uphill
and seems to be
an old field boun-
dary drift8
Bevill's Wood
is much more 
level.  It contained
a three-storeyed
coppice with standards, in-
cluding many big ash
stools.  It has now been
mostly cleared or drastically
8809
[DIAG]
thinned by the Forestry Com-
mission.
The big ash stools in Monks'
Wood are like those in Hayley, but
lower;  often quite healed over at top.

The Wood was visited
about 11 p.m. on a still
warm night.  Many small 
noises but little continued
activity:  perhaps the traffic
on the A1 prevents animals 
from coming out earlier.
8813
Carex pendula is re-
markably common in the
Wood.
There is a very thick tall
thorn hedge between the Ex-
perimental station and the
road.
March 21. Monks' Wood.
Two crab trees were
seen along the S.W. edge of the
wood.
The join onto the Old
Quarter is by no means
obvious.
Quarter Ride appears 
to be quite new:  it cuts
across ridge and furrow.
Service Ride is not visible.
Carex riparia is not fre-
quent, but occurs near B".
