live Up suckers.
Tingewick 99% - but Up
suckers appear quite undiseased.

Burton Hartshorn. Considerable

Many jettied houses have
brick-tiles. Often these are quite
good imitations of brickwork,
including flat arches to window
heads. Sometimes they are bevelled
at corners. Window rveals are
usually avoided by setting
window-frame flush with face 
of wall.
  Some houses have more ob-
vious tile-hanging. Occasional
use of alate slabs each fastened
on by two big    
nails or bolts   [DIAG]
at bottom.
  House at corner [DIAG]
of market square is of 3 3/4 storeys
with 3 jetties. Brick-tiling of top
storey is apparently modern, of
new tiles.
