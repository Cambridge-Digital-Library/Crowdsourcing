Swifts now very active in Canea.

Peteromarula. Winter semi-rosette
very abundant on the arsenals at
Canea, on the N-facing aeolianite
masonry between the arches. Each
wall receives the rainwater from
the valley bwtween two roofs, which
should dixcharge by a shoot, now
broken.

Adonis microcarpa. Earth of the

dinner-party. Fried in their shells
with some garlic. One pulls out the
body of the animal, discarding the

(I had 5; of 7 others, 5 had more,
one had none, and our host had 1.)
A sirocco day. Light wind from
the S., very warm, sea calm.
Jenny complains of dust. Cloudless.
Snails are in season & are sold

     Imbros Gorge cont.
The road runs high on the W.
side. The gorge is apparently
not very precipitous, it has
buttresses of rock separated by
gullies, many of which have pro-
digious screes. Not much is in-
accessible to goats.
The cliff odf p,    is at
point 244269; it is the on ly cliff of
E. and N. aspect seen.
Brassica cretica. 3-4 big plants on
E-facing limestone cliff. A big
stout plant with panicles of large
white flowers. Leaves spathulate,
strengly auricled. Flavour weakly
cabbge-like; said in Fl. Eur. to be
the origin of cauliflower.
Prasium majus. Seems to be
rare in W. Crete and confined to
2447
cliffs (Site p. 2442).

Ceterach. Two pl;ants seen of a fren
which resembles Ceterach in all re-
spects save the 2-pinnate leaves.
?Hybrid between Ceterach and
Asplenium adiantum-nigrum,
both of which are present. Both
individuals alike (Site p. 2442.)
   Cypress trees in this and the
Sphakianos Pharangi form up to
50% cover - not closed stands. Prin-
cipally on cliffs and on screes that
are otherwise vegetated-  to some 
extent also on loose screes.
  Cliffs are few in the Imbros
Gorge; the only one easily accessible
is that described. Specialized cliff
plants are mainly restricted to
this one cliff.

   Steep limestone hills with small

the Askyfou Plain but absent
N. of it.
   Grazing now probsbly more severe

than round the Omalos. Probably
slightly more fine material, but
soil does not appear ro be an
obstacle; many trees are on scree.
   Phillyrea freq. on N. side.
   Prickly-oaks are genetically
variable in colour and in time of
leafing. They are often not easily
distinguishable from Phillyrea
but none looks like Q. ilex.
   On both sidws of the pass
there are occasional very large
Q. coccifera trees stsnding isola-
ted in hollows.
