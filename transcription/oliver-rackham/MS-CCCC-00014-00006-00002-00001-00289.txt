Swifts now very active in Canea.

Peteromarula. Winter semi-rosette
very abundant on the arsenals at
Canea, on the N-facing aeolianite
masonry between the arches. Each
wall receives the rainwater from
the valley bwtween two roofs, which
should dixcharge by a shoot, now
broken.

Adonis microcarpa. Earth of the 
Venetian fortifications, Canea.

English garden snails and may be 
the same species. They formed the
2nd course at  [SYMBOL]  [SYMBOL]
dinner-party. Fried in their shells
with some garlic. One pulls out the
body of the animal, discarding the
rear end. It tasted rather like the
muscles of cold mutton from near the

(I had 5; of 7 others, 5 had more,
one had none, and our host had 1.)
A sirocco day. Light wind from
the S., very warm, sea calm.
Jenny complains of dust. Cloudless.
Snails are in season & are sold
in great quantities in boxes: shops 
are crawling with them.

Deepest part is a channel at the

The Quercus ilex question.
   The Krapi and Xylodema area

searched the area on the ground &

and a few on the cliff in the Im-
bros Gorge.
   Several botanists concur with T-B.
T-B reports extensive defoliation 
by gipsy-moths c. 1912 which had, he
says, killed some of the ilexes.
   Was rhe "ilex" really a misiden-
2461
tification of Q. coccifera (or Phillyrea)
in its tree form?
1. No ilex now visible - despite T-B's
statement that a few trees escaped the
caterpillars.
2. No remains of ilex.
3. Abundani large Q. coccifera and
Phillyrea, whose appesranca closely
resembles T-B's description of the
"ilex" woods. But many, tho' not
all, of these trees would have
been topiary or saplings in T-B's 
time.
4. Atypical habitat for ilex - too
dry & windswept.
5. Ilex does occur in typical habi-
tat nearby.
6. Would gipsy-moth have killwd all
ilexes but not other trees?
7. How did it spare those at Askyfou
[22462-22463]

and in Imbros Gorge?
8. TB may have been unaware of 
coccifera as a tree - he says it is

   The concentration in numbers

may be some "coppicing" effect
due to burning. On the S. side of
hill is rather more macchia and
fewer orchids.

Quercus macrolepis.
   Closely resembles Q. pubescens in
size and habit, but can sometimes
be identified at a distsnce. Pubescens
more easily retains its dead leaves
esp. when young. Its twigs are gener-
ally thicker and its bark blackish.
Macrolepis has usually thicker twigs
and very lichenized bark. Twigs are
conspicuously whitish. Often retains
at least a few of the giant acorn-
cups. Earlier-leafing, at least on
few trees now in young leaf.
   Macrolepis begins abruptly c. 1 km
S. of Rethymno, across a small lime-
stone gorge from the main road. Marly
Limestone. Becomes rare on schist
and returns on fill, partly composed
of limestone, around Armenois.
   Q. pubescens is uncommon in
macrolepis territory.

Q. macrolepis behaves very like
Q. pubescens. On water-retaining soils
in cultivated zone. Evidently a fast
grower. No very old trees seen. Some irregular pollarding but no well-defined
pollards. Forms groves of big trees,
No definite evidence of cultivation.
Invades ex-cultivation, forming
definite woods, although not associ-
ated with Smilax etc. as is pubes-
cens in W. Crete.
   Old trees are often broad, spreading,
with arching branches, somewhat pen-
dulous with upturned twigs, rather
in the manner of Populus nigra.
   Commonest field tree in  Armenoi
