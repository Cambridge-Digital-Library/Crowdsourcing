Swifts now very active in Canea.

Peteromarula. Winter semi-rosette
very abundant on the arsenals at
Canea, on the N-facing aeolianite
masonry between the arches. Each
wall receives the rainwater from
the valley bwtween two roofs, which
should dixcharge by a shoot, now
broken.

Adonis microcarpa. Earth of the

dinner-party. Fried in their shells
with some garlic. One pulls out the
body of the animal, discarding the

(I had 5; of 7 others, 5 had more,
one had none, and our host had 1.)
A sirocco day. Light wind from
the S., very warm, sea calm.
Jenny complains of dust. Cloudless.
Snails are in season & are sold

The Quercus ilex question.

and a few on the cliff n rhe Im-
bros Gorge.
Several botanists concur with T-B.
T-B reports extensive defoliation 
by gipsy-moths c. 1912 which had, he
says, killed some of the ilexes.
   Was rhe "ilex" really a misiden-
2461
tification of Q. coccifera (or Phillyrea)
in its tree form?
1. No ilex now visible - despite T-B's
statement that a few trees escaped the
caterpillars.
2. No remains of ilex.
3. Abundani large Q. coccifera and
Phillyrea, whose appesranca closely
resembles T-B's description of the
"ilex" woods. Bur many, tho' not
all, of these trees would have
been topiary or saplings in T-B's 
time.
4. Atypical habitat for ilex - too
dry & windswept.
5. Ilex does occur in typical habi-
tat nearby.
6. Would gipsy-moth have killwd all
ilexes but not other trees?
7. How did it spare those at Askyfou
[22462-22463]
