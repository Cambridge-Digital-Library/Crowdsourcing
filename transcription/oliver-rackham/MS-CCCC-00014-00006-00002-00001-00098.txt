[TABLE] The folowwing minor rides
show wheel-marks:
North section, the two running
N.E. from the pond ride. The

second one of these can be
traced right up to the railway
near the W. corner of the
Triangle. It is visible as a
strip of very dense bushes
with wheel-ruts underneath.
West section, the west ride.
[TABLE]Deer have been eating
Juncus conglomeratus.
[TABLE]Salix cinerea x repens
[!!!!] is the large willow growing
in the northern pool.

Two large elms recently
felled at Long-stow:
1. Mean diam.2'4". 1830. Very
uniform save 1857-69 [????] ramur.
Polyporus rot.
2. 2'8". 1798. Very steady decline.
Somewhat foxed. U. carpinifolia

May 9.
[TABLE] Following two fine days,
the horse-chestnut just to
the S. of the pine at the
middle of the avenue on
the W. side shows slight
signs of wilting. The new
leaves are almost fully
developed. [TABLE]  [24 in Rishbeth
May 10.  [TABLE]          numbering]
[TABLE] The above horse-chestnut
shows no sign of further
wilting. Its neighbour on [25]
the S. [!!!!] in the same row
has very small leaflets. Another
just S. of the great beech
in the S. part of the same
row, which has previously died
back at the top, is much
[TABLE] [37]

worse this year and slightly
wilted all over.
May 11.
[TABLE] No further change in
these horse-chestnuts.
[TABLE] Some of the trees in this
avenue, especially those that
have slight crown symptoms,
have slime flowing from
the lower part of the trunk.
May 12.
[TABLE] Three plants of "trumpet
vine" (a climber with 2-pinnate
leaves and leaf tendrils) were
bought in the market and
put out in a box at Leck-
hampton.
May 13.
[TABLE] One gourd has germina-
ted.


[7962-7963]

May 14.
[TABLE] The gourd seedling has
two white patches on its
cotyledons----apparently
as a result of touching
the polythene bag in which it
was being germinated in bright
sunshine.
Hayley Wood [!!!!] Institute [!!!!] (Educational
Association).
[TABLE] Conopodium is about
to flower in the Ditch Ride
(several plants).
[TABLE] Milium effusum is
scattered in a number of the

lighter parts of the wood.

Madingley Wood (Educational
Association).
[TABLE] Much the greatest area
is pure mercury. Bluebells
are in scattered patches,
mainly in the new wood.
Nettles occur in large
areas, especially on the
W. side of the ride to the
S. gate. Primroses are
scattered in the S.W. field.
None of the [!!!!] wetter zones
is represented.
May 15.
[TABLE] Stellaria holostea occurs
by the road between Great
Eversden and Kingston.
[TABLE] Mercury grows in the
hedges along the S. part
of Crane's Lane (between Kingston

and Wimpole).

Eversden Wood.
Specimens:
Salix cinerea -- typical of
most of the Salix in the
wood.
S. cinerea x repens. S. repens
was not seen.
Quercus Robur
Carex riparia

[TABLE] This wood is very similar
to Hayley. Ther is somewhat
less standing water in the
wetter areas.
[TABLE] All the oaks have been
felled (1941 according to the
County Planning booklet).

All this has been coppiced
(apparently at the time of
felling the oaks) and is
now about 30ft high, forming
a much denser canopy than

Douglas with some [!!!!][????]Scots
and Cedrus atlantica
on compact gravel over clay.
Trees very widely spaced
(apparently through shortga
of seed), well over 100
ft high, sometimes over 3ft
diam., with very rugged
bark (in the case of Doug-
las) and enormous knots
where side branches have
been trimmed off. Cedars

rather similar in habit
but less branched below.
[TABLE] The understorey is
rather copious mainly
beech, young Douglas, and
Amelanchier. Occasional oak
and holly. Ther has
been some thinning in


[7978-7979]

recent years. All the
understorey is spontaneous.
[TABLE] The best trees (some
with over 7 tons of timber)
are at the bottom of the
slope. Those at the
top are no longer increasing
in height because wind
blast attacks their tops.
A bomb crater was colon-
ized by a dense stand
of young Douglas until this
was destroyed by heavy
snow in 1963.
[TABLE] Juncus effusus is
common on the ground.
Sphagnum occurs in flushes
Φ Pseudotsuga.

Mainly conifers.
Φ Pinus nigra, and P.

trus are abundant on the
ground.
[TABLE] Epiphytes Rhododendron

[TABLE] Lysimachia nemorum
is frequent, especially on
tracks.
[TABLE] A small herd of fallow
deer was seen here. They
were very amenable and
moved away slowly even

when approached by a large
party within 50 yards.
[TABLE] Bluebell is rather scarce,
mainly in hollows.

Mark Ash Wood.
[TABLE] Ther are four types
of land use in the New
Forest:
1. Open common.
2. Ancient & Ornamental Wood-
land (7,-9,000 acres)
with grazing rights.
3. Inclosures managed by
the Forestry Commission.
4. Private freeholds.

[TABLE] This wood is Ancient
& Ornamental. It is on
rather damp ground


[7982-7983]

with much Sphagnum
and Leucobryum especially
in flushes and hollows.
[TABLE] Beech is the dominant
tree, of immense height,
usually with a short
stout trunk and about
20 immense erect or
spreading branches. Most
of the trees have a pioneer
habit and were probably
pollarded, a practice prohibi-
ted by Act of Parliament in
the 18th cent.
[TABLE] Oak is less abundant
but similar in size. Not
commonly pollarded.
[TABLE] Yew is frequent: usu-
ally small to medium
trees.

[TABLE] Holly is characteristic
and is about the only
under-storey tree, usually
in small groups and
copses. Sometimes quite a
large tree. It is a food
of deer. The Bark is
commonly stripped off by
fallow stags. Trees are
felled in hard [!!!!]winter weather
to provide browse for the
deer (as was formely 
beech in dry summers).
[TABLE] In one flush, Sphag-
num (including SØ rubellum),
Polytrichum commune,
Vaccinium myrtillus, and
Erica tetralix are dom-
inant. Oak regenerates
freely in this area.


[7984-7985]

[TABLE] Oxalis is abundant on
the ground in drier areas.
[TABLE] Hypnum cupressiforme
is about the only epiphyte
on beech.
[TABLE]Beech regenerates only
under protection from graz
-ing, for instance in holly
thickets.
[TABLE] Beeches are said to
live for c.250 years, oaks
c.350 years. The exact
ages are indeterminate
because no trees are
allowed to be felled un-
less rotten. Most of
the trees that die are
hollow. Armillaria is a
common cause of
death.

[TABLE] Until recently, no felling,
inclusing, or planting were
allowed in these woods.
An act of 1949 was
designed to permit artifi-
cial regeneration in iso-
lated blocks of not more
than 20 acres. In 1951,
two clearings were made
and fenced in a good
mast year. These are
now a dense growth of
pole beech (Φ), but the
surrounding trees have
been damaged by wind
effects in the gap. To
prevent this from recurring,
enclosure are now made in
natural gaps. Trees are usually
self-sown, but planting is neces-


[7986-7987]

sary in areas of [!!!!] tacken; in
such places both oak and
beech are put in. Single
trees are also planted.
[TABLE] This part of the Forest is
chiefly of interest for organisms
living in rotten trees: wood-eating
beetles of national interest, and
hole-nesting birds. Hornets nests
are frequent.
[TABLE] Yew is eaten by deer and
commoners animals (Φ). They
are very rarely poisoned, unless
driven to eat too much.
[TABLE] Ivy is very scarce, except
in the crowns of trees, as deer
are partial to the foliage.
[TABLE] Hylocomium splendens is local.
[TABLE] One beech tree has a
branch which cornes down [!!!!]

[DIAG]

the ground and has rooted to
form a nearly independent
tree-a very rare occurence. It
is about to repeat this.

Oakley Inclosure.
[TABLE] A forestry Commission
inclosure with a great variety
of crops and practices.
[TABLE] A small herd (c. 20) of
fallow deer was seen here. Simi-
larly very tame. They included
a white doe and fawn.
[TABLE] Fallow deer are the most
numerous. White ones are fre-


[7988-7989]

quents: numbers of male and
female are about equal, but
their mothers are [!!!!]ally brown.
Red deer are very few. Roe
were absent in the Middle
Ages. Since 1900, their numbers
have been increasing, despite
losses of 30% annually by
lung-worms, and killing by
foxes and dogs. Last year,
the deer were numbered
and a big shoot was held,
the weaker individuals being
killed. 20-30 sika are killed
annually.
[TABLE] Deer poaching is done by a
few skilled locals with guns, by
gipsies with snares, and towns-
people with guns. When snares
are found, either there is an

ambush laid for the setter, or
the snare is cut and arranged
so that it looks as if still set.
[TABLE] Pedicularis palustris and
Ruscus are found in this
area.
[TABLE] Bracken is patchy, and
has been recently slightly
frosted in hollows in this area.
[TABLE] Beech mast is produced in
small quantities in one year
in four.
[TABLE] Acorns is produced one
year in two. In 1964, animals
died of excess of acorns.
[TABLE] Tsuga is succeeding on a
waterlogged day.
[TABLE] Poplars have been tried un-
successfully on wet ground in
the Bratley valley.


[7990-7991]

[TABLE] Felling of conifers is done
in hollow squares with 20
standards per acre to pro-
vide seed for the next crop and
to encourage crossbills.
[TABLE] Woodcock and snipe have
not recovered from the setback
of the 1963 winter.
[TABLE] [!!!!]Fomes is not important.
[TABLE] The deer eat the onter
bark of mountain ash, but
only where it occurs in open
stands. This is probably an
individual idiosyncrasy. It does
not harm the tree.
Boldenwood Farm.
[TABLE] This is a small enclosed
area of grassland.
[TABLE] Deer have always fed on
the fields, but the present

tenant has encouraged them
in the past two years and
has prohibited shooting and
disturbance. These is now
a resident herd of about 40
fallow deer (all bucks) which
spend most of their time her.
About 20 of these deer were
seen about 70 yards away.
They were quite unconcerned
when a large crowd looked
at them through a narrow
belt. When met in the forest,
the same animals are less
tame. They included Tinny,
a white buck of great size,
9 years old.
Bushy Bratley.
[TABLE] A mosaic of open Calluna
heath with occasional bushes,


[7992-7993]

and patches of dense holly
scrub.
[TABLE] Frangula (not Rhamnus)
occurs on the apparently dry
heath, manly isolated.
[TABLE] The scrub grows about 20ft
hight. It consists and mainly
of holly bushes and small
trees, but with much yew
and mountain ash. Pine
shows little tendency to in-
vade.

[TABLE] A witches-broom [DIAG]
was seen surroun-
ding a tall Douglas
near the top.
[TABLE] Some of the
big Douglases have been
felled. One log measured

74 "ft" long x 2'10" at the
large end. 106 years old.

Brownsea Island (Bryophytes p.8009)
[TABLE] The northern part of
the island, the Nature Reserve,
was perambulated.
[TABLE] The marsh at the E.
end was inclosed by a
wall erected by Waugh in
the 1850s as a preliminary
to digging for the china clay
which he supposed to lie
under the sea. It has
now long been derelict and
is mainly saltings. This is
the most interesting past as


[7994-7995]

a bird sanctuary.
[TABLE] Canada geese and goslings
were seen on the saltings.
[TABLE] There is a big fresh marsh,
much invaded by alder and
birch, running inland between
the church and the villa.
[TABLE] There are giant elms around
the village.
[TABLE] Birds on the saltings can
be watched from a public hide
(on the boundary of the re-
serve) with slot-machine
binoculars run by a commercial
firm.
[TABLE] Terns nest on artificial
island which have been
built of logs and gravel in
the salt marsh.
[TABLE] Oxford Wood (to the N.

of the villa) is a tall
wood of Pinus maritime and
other pines which escaped
the great [????] fore of 1936. It
contains about 70 herons'
nests like big rooks' nests
in the upper branches.
[TABLE] There are a few big Ar-
butus trees in this wood,
to 25 ft high.
[TABLE] The remainder of the
reserve (N. of the main E.-W.
path) was formely high
forest but was burnt out
in 1936. A very few living
trees, all Pinus maritima,
without lower branches,
remain on spurs between
gullies on the N. side. Many
of those that were killed


[7996]

still stand; the [DIAG]
sap-wood has
become eroded
to an alarming
extent near the
base, but the
tough heart-wood
supports the
weight of the trunk.
[TABLE] In place of the forest, there
is a dense stand of young
pines (P. maritima, sylvestris,
radiata) c.30ft high. Ther
are a few yews and young
oaks. Rhododendron forms
dense thickets over large
areas, growing 20ft high,
and largely excluding
pines and other vegetation.
Birch is frequent; bracken locally
dominant Cladonia sylvatica occurs
locally.
