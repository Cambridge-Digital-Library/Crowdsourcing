[TABLE] The folowwing minor rides
show wheel-marks:
North section, the two running
N.E. from the pond ride. The

second one of these can be
traced right up to the railway
near the W. corner of the
Triangle. It is visible as a
strip of very dense bushes
with wheel-ruts underneath.
West section, the west ride.
[TABLE]Deer have been eating
Juncus conglomeratus.
[TABLE]Salix cinerea x repens
[!!!!] is the large willow growing
in the northern pool.

Two large elms recently
felled at Long-stow:
1. Mean diam.2'4". 1830. Very
uniform save 1857-69 [????] ramur.
Polyporus rot.
2. 2'8". 1798. Very steady decline.
Somewhat foxed. U. carpinifolia


[7960-7961]

(Specimen taken).
May 9.
[TABLE] Following two fine days,
the horse-chestnut just to
the S. of the pine at the
middle of the avenue on
the W. side shows slight
signs of wilting. The new
leaves are almost fully
developed. [TABLE]  [24 in Rishbeth
May 10.  [TABLE]          numbering]
[TABLE] The above horse-chestnut
shows no sign of further
wilting. Its neighbour on [25]
the S. [!!!!] in the same row
has very small leaflets. Another
just S. of the great beech
in the S. part of the same
row, which has previously died
back at the top, is much
[TABLE] [37]

worse this year and slightly
wilted all over.
May 11.
[TABLE] No further change in
these horse-chestnuts.
[TABLE] Some of the trees in this
avenue, especially those that
have slight crown symptoms,
have slime flowing from
the lower part of the trunk.
May 12.
[TABLE] Three plants of "trumpet
vine" (a climber with 2-pinnate
leaves and leaf tendrils) were
bought in the market and
put out in a box at Leck-
hampton.
May 13.
[TABLE] One gourd has germina-
ted.


[7962-7963]

May 14.
[TABLE] The gourd seedling has
two white patches on its
cotyledons----apparently
as a result of touching
the polythene bag in which it
was being germinated in bright
sunshine.
Hayley Wood [!!!!] Institute [!!!!] (Educational
Association).
[TABLE] Conopodium is about
to flower in the Ditch Ride
(several plants).
[TABLE] Milium effusum is
scattered in a number of the

lighter parts of the wood.
[DIAG]


[7964-7965]

Madingley Wood (Educational
Association).
[TABLE] Much the greatest area
is pure mercury. Bluebells
are in scattered patches,
mainly in the new wood.
Nettles occur in large
areas, especially on the
W. side of the ride to the
S. gate. Primroses are
scattered in the S.W. field.
None of the [!!!!] wetter zones
is represented.
May 15.
[TABLE] Stellaria holostea occurs
by the road between Great
Eversden and Kingston.
[TABLE] Mercury grows in the
hedges along the S. part
of Crane's Lane (between Kingston

and Wimpole).

Eversden Wood.
Specimens:
Salix cinerea -- typical of
most of the Salix in the
wood.
S. cinerea x repens. S. repens
was not seen.
Quercus Robur
Carex riparia

[TABLE] This wood is very similar
to Hayley. Ther is somewhat
less standing water in the
wetter areas.
[TABLE] All the oaks have been
felled (1941 according to the
County Planning booklet).
About a third of them

*[DIAG] Oxlip dominant  [DIAG] Both
[DIAG]  Filipendula dominant

have coppiced from the stumps.
[TABLE] The original coppice
was Crataegus (mainly hybrids),
hazel, maple, and ash.
Poplar and willows are
frequent. Elm is found
in several compact areas.
All this has been coppiced
(apparently at the time of
felling the oaks) and is
now about 30ft high, forming
a much denser canopy than
Hayley.
A: pollard oak.
B: row of big elms on
the bank, felled and now
coppiced.
[TABLE] Euonymus occurs on the
S. side of the wood.
[TABLE] There is much birch in


[7970-7971]

the wood.

Acer, Betula. Undergrowth
perhaps Filipendula, but
not definitely determinable
[TABLE] I: this stream is sunk
in a seemingly natural ditch
some 3ft deep and 4ft wide,
with no trace of banks.
The flat ground on either


[7972-7973]

side is covered with mercury.
This stream lies in a
marked valley.

mon on rides.
[TABLE] J: Veronica chamaedrys on
a ride.

on log.
[TABLE] L: quite deep open
water several yards wide.
[TABLE] The Carex riparia area
covers at least 2 acres.
There are some open areas
invaded at  the edges by
dense willow scrub. Carex
is dominant where it occurs.
It was not seen elsewhere.
