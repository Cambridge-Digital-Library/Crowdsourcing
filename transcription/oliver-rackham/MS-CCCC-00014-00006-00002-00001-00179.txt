  The boundary between Great
Waldingfield, Newton, and Ed-
wardstone runs through the
fields N.W. of the woods,
sometimes as a hedge, some-
times across fields. No notable
features visible along the ground,
save at the N. end of Park
Wood where the features are
shown on the next page.

  These woods are best taken
together. The differences between
them appear to be mainly
geological and do not exactly
follow the parish boundary.
The earthworks do not form
an easily interpreted boundary.
1. Earthworks difficult to in-
terpret. High Wood South makes
sense. High Wood West is most
3551
obscure; its W. boundary is of
very recent clearing. Park
Wood has certainly been reduced
to the N.E., its boundary on
that side is dead straight and
part of the old boundary can
be seen in a hedge line running
N. from the present N. end.
This took place before 1835.
The present S. boundary of
Park Wood is ancient (except
in the neighbourhood of the larch
plantation); despite the map,
it is not quite straight. The
lane through High Wood is
normally embanked. Between
Park & High Woods is a
remarkable area banked in
reverse, evidently a former
[13552-13553]
3552
glade or laund. It is ap-
proached by a drift-way with
fairly regular banks but puz-
zling changes of orientation.
The bank on the High Wood side
tends to be the more massive.
[!!!!]3.[!!!!] 2. No other internal evidence
of cultivation. Some pits.
3. Long list of trees & shrubs.
4. Woodland structure neg-
lected but otherwise intact.*
5. Geological variation similar
to that at Hintlesham. Mainly
dry.
6. Pollard oak and lime in
important positions.
7. About 13 acres of Tilia cor-
data coppice (nearly twice as
much as at Hintlesham). Oc-
* Many big oaks.
3553
curs as dominant with
fairly large stools. E. margin
of lime area probably more
abrupt than W. This is
probably a natural distribu-
tion, especially as there is
also a lime pollard. To the
E. the Tilia abut on acid
woodland; to the W. it abuts,
and probably transgresses
slightly, on calcareous. Some
[!!!!]8[!!!!] huge stools*; population unevenaged.
8. Hornbeam dominant in
coppice over most of the rest
of Park Wood, scattered in
High Wood. None in the N.W.
calcareous area of Park Wood.
Although there is local evidence
of planting, the present dis-
* Stools of Hintlesham shape.
[13554-13555]
3554
tribution of hornbeam is
related to soil, it being more
abundant in the acid areas.
It occurs only as large coppice.
9. Rare conjunction of hornbeam
and lime.
10. Cherry generally frequent as
standards and large poles.
A few very large trees. This
must be a phenomenon of
the last century. Perhaps the
largest concentration of cherry
in E. Anglian woods (save Arger
Fen).
11. Holly frequent.
12. Melica remarkably frequent,
especially on earthworks.
13. Castanea generally scattered.
14. Campanula trachelium freq.
3555
15. Bluebell unusually common
for Suffolk.

17. Elm invasion of both calcar-

latter very unusual.
18. Large stools of ash, lime,
hornbeam. The largest lime stools
are round the edges of the lime
area.
[13556-13557]
2556
A very important pair
of woods, despite the difficulties
of interpretation. Vegetational
evidence for the woodland
being mainly primary is strong.
Some evidence of planting;
Castanea, ? hornbeam. But
there does not appear to be
a Hockering situation with
the lime, which appears to
have a "natural" distribution
and population structure.
3557
Juncus articulatus in rersevoir
at Hole Fsrm, Great Waldingfield.
Grows in about 2 ft of water
and forms an extensive
submerged system with flow-
ing-submerged rhizomes.
  At Hole Farm there are
two giant black-poplars
about 4 ft dia, with leaning 
trunks and great curving
main branches. Bark rugged
and bossed. One is rather
thin in the crown.
  Along the Box above Brook
House are some old meadows
with ancient hedges. Some
encroachment of scrub. Alders
along stresm.
[13558-13559]
3558
August 31.
  Tilia cordata is frequent
at avenham. Seven large
trees in the churchyard: glaucous
leaves undernesth, bark more
rugged than the hybrid and
stems fluted rather like horn-
beam, epicormics much fewer
than in T. europea. There
are also some pollards along
with the hybrid in the streets.

------------------------------------
  Stallington Wood, Edwardstone,
is intact.
  Brook House and Hole
Farm sre both hall houses.
Hole Fsrm is a remarkably long
3559
building with a Georgian
front.
  A huge Ulmus glabra tree
by the road from Hole Farm
to the village.
  This road has a atretch
of mixed hedge which on
approaching the village suddenly
changes to pure elm.
  There is a large active 
gravel pit beside Stallington
Wood.
  Several large timber-framed
]houses at Upsher Green, includ-
ing some late examples.

  Great quantities of Impatiens
glandulifera on a dried-up
stream bed at York.
  Betula [!!!!] verruessa ap-
pears to be the predomiant spe-
cies in the S. Yorkshire secondary
woods.
  The railway from Darlington to
Bishop Auckland passes through
hilly sandstone country, mostly
late enclosure and permanent
pasture. Darlington North Road sta-
tion, which still operates, is an aston-
ishing example of railway dereliction
& decay.

September 2.
Between Tow Law and the
Derwent valley at Consett is
mainly enclosed improved
grassland with some stretches
of open moor (mainly Ulex
& Sarothamnus, not much
ericoid). Sparse woods and
belts and tracks of scattered
trees mostly Pinus sylvestris,
beech & sycamore. The sup-
posed wood between Oxen Law
and the road is open heath,
mainly Calluna, with scattered
beeches and sycamores.
  Comparatively little bracken
in this area.
[13562-13563]
3562
Chesters
Rat scull found below the
granary. So museum label: the
scull is too big for a mouse.

Fighting cock spurs. Bony horn-
shaped projections from the 
leg bone.

Stanley and Sunniside, in
Crook, are mainly late 19th
cent. villages of terraced stone
houses of very grim appearance,
without porches or eaves despite
the altitude of nearly 1,000 ft.
Tow Law is even worse.
  Between [!!!!Tor Law!!!!] [????] and
Corbridge is an enclosed and
more wooded country. Woods
3563
mixed decijuous and coniferous.
None appears more thsn c.
100 years old.
  Near Corbridge is a
magnificent free-stsnding
oak, with a short trunk about
2 1/2 ft dia. and a vast hemi-
spherical crown.
  The Tyne valley is more
wooded still, with Ulmus glabra,
sycamore, oak, larch;a nd alder
along the river. Trees appear
mostly 19 cent. plantations. Some
very tall.
  Between Corbridge and Brun-
ton (via Stagshaw) and immedi-
ately beyond Chesters, the country-
side is mainly enclosed hedged
improved grassaland. The
[13564-13565]
3564
Wall has disappeared 
under the road, though the
fosse and the vallum are
well preserved.
  West of the Sharpley bend,
The WAll enters unimproved,
though still mainly enclosed,
moorland.
  Moorland between the Wall
and Vellum at Turret 33B,
now being excavated.
Thick sward of Deschampsia
[!!!!] caesp. and Festuac ovine.
Deschampsia flex. rsre.
Potentilla erecta snd Galium
saxabile ab.
Little Nardus.
No ericoids.
Scattered patches of bracken.
2565
  Occasional shallow drainage
grips with straggling Sphagnum,
but no appreciable blanket
peat.
  There is a small wood
about 1 mile E. of Sewingshields
Farm, on both sides of the
road. Mainly Corsican, planted
as a dense stand probably
1946. Occasional Betula pu-
bescens, Sorbus aucuparia, and
Salix cf atrocinerea. Ground
vegetation almost limited to
sparse bracken. The wood
is very [????grimy]. Trees slow grow-
ing and small: Corsicsn about
18 ft high. The sallows have
most of their leaves russet
brown on both sides and
[13566-13567]
3566
somewhat tattered; there are a 
few lammas shoots.

Houseteads Wood.
  Above Housesteads farm, on
Whin Sills.
[DIAG]
Trees ash, sycamore,
Pinus sylvestris (not scotica), larch,
beech in  ± equal numbers.
3567
Occasional spruce. Frequent
small mountain-ash. The
trees appear to be all c. 100
years old, about 30 ft high.
Little or no regeneration.
  No regular understorey.
  Ground vegetation dom-
inated generally by Luzula
sylvatica, often forming a
pure stand with great quan-
tities of litter. Patches of
bracken; smaller area
with sparse bracken. Athy-
rium, and Dryopteris filix
mas both abundant. Deschampsia
flexuosa freq. Chamaenerion loc. ab.
  The rock is very hard,
resembling millstone-grit in texture,
pinkish-buff to bluish-gray, in a
[13568-13569]
3568
subcolumnar formatioon with
horizontal and vertical joints
like Land's End granite. Does 
not readily lichenize.
  This wood appears to
be largely a 19th-cent. plantation;
the Luzula, Sorbus & suggest
that there has always been
spme fragment of woodland
on the cliffs.

  The moorland around is
mainly grassy with patches 
of Juncus effusus and artic-
latus in the hollows. Polytrichum
formosum frequent on rocks
and in Housesteads Wood. Many
artificial patterns of various
types:
3069
(i) Lynchet terraces below the
fort.
(ii) Narrow straight ridge & furrow below
the lynchets, extending S. to
the bottom of a shallow valley
about 400 yards from the
road. Small rock outcrops and
scattered boulders are quite
frequent, mainly in the ridges.
(iii) Parallel drainage grips W.
of the Wall.
(iiii) Staight ridges resembling
broad ridge & furrow, fairly
extensive N. of the Wall.
Could be a result of vegetation
changes on a system of old
choked drainage grips.
  The Northumberland conifer
[13570-13571]
3570
plantatiomn extend S. nearly
to the Broomlee Loch.

The view S. in over mainly
enclosed permanent pasture.
The Cross Fell area in the 
distsnce.

Brocolitia fort is in simi-
lar grassland. Walls completely
buried; an altar (?) used as
a rubbing-post for cattle. Only
the Temple of Mithrasd is exposed.
Coventina's Well is a fenced-
off marshy pool.

  Chesters fort is in the
grounds of Chesters mansion, with 
19th-cent. plantings of Ulmus
3571
glabra, beech, &. Beech grows
very fast, reacdhing c. 2 1/2ft dia.
in 120 years.
The Tyne is a clear fast
rather deep river. Alders
along its banks.
  The Roman strong-room
has its original ceiling of
two massive barrel ribs con-
nected by rough slabs. Abun-
dant Pellia fabbroniana under it.
  Below Chesters the Wall is
very indistinct except at the 
bridge abutments. On the E.
side of the Tyne  neither wall
nor vallum can be seen
at all for about 1/2 mile.
The mile-castle is very in-
distinct. A few probably
[13572-13573]
3572
Roman facing-stones can be
seen in hedge-banks. the Wall
stsrts very abruptly again in
the short well-preserved length
which includes Brunton Turret.

Lycoperdon giganteum. One
over 12 in. dia. in a field  near
Brunton Turret.

Fields in this whole area
are very rectilinear. Hedges
seldom contain more shrubs
that Crataegus and sometimes
Fraxinus. A few hedges by
the main road through Wall are
an exception, with 4-6 shrubs,
and sinuous. This applies
everywhere between Bishop
3573
Auckland and Chesters.
  A few old pollard oaks be-
tween Wall and Hexham.

Weather generally cold,
wet and windy. Slight sleet on
the Wall. Brighter around
Housesteads. Mist hung all
day on the eastern hills above
Tow Law, c. 1000 ft.
September 3.
The garden at Clarence
House contains large trees of
Ulmus glabra and carpinifolia
agg.
