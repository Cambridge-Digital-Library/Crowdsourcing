The boundary between Great
Waldingfield, Newton, and Ed-
wardstone runs through the
fields N.W. of the woods,
sometimes as a hedge, some-
times across fields. No notable
features visible along the ground,
save at the N. end of Park
Wood where the features are
shown on the next page.

These woods are best taken
together. The differences between
them appear to be mainly
geological and do not exactly
follow the parish boundary.
The earthworks do not form
an easily interpreted boundary.
1. Earthworks difficult to in-
terpret. High Wood South makes
sense. High Wood West is most
3551
obscure; its W. boundary is of
very recent clearing. Park
Wood has certainly been reduced
to the N.E., its boundary on
that side is dead straight and
part of the old boundary can
be seen in a hedge line running
N. from the present N. end.
This took place before 1835.
The present S. boundary of
Park Wood is ancient (except
in the neighbourhood of the larch
plantation); despite the map,
it is not quite straight. The
lane through High Wood is
normally embanked. Between
Park & High Woods is a
remarkable area banked in
reverse, evidently a former
[13552-13553]
3552
glade or laund. It is ap-
proached by a drift-way with
fairly regular banks but puz-
sling changes of orientation.
The bank on the High Wood side
tends to be the more massive.
[!!!!]3.[!!!!] 2. No other internal evidence
of cultivation. Some pits.
3. Long list of trees & shrubs.
4. Woodland structure neg-
lected but otherwise intact.*
5. Geological variation similar
to that at Hintlesham. Mainly
dry.
6. Pollard oak and lime in
important positions.
7. About 13 acres of Tilia cor-
data coppice (nearly twice as
much as at Hintlesham). Oc-
* Many big oaks.

curs as dominant with
fairly large stools. E. margin
of lime area probably more
abrupt than W. This is
probably a natural distribu-
tion, especially as there is
also a lime pollard. To the
E. the Tilia abut on acid
woodland; to the W. it abuts,
and probably transgressed
slightly, on calcareous. Some
[!!!!]8[!!!!] huge stools*; population unevenaged.
8. Hornbeam dominant in
coppice over most of the rest
of Park Wood, scattered in
High Wood. None in the N.W.
calcareous area of Park Wood.
Although there is local evidence
of planting, the present dis-
* Stools of Hintlesham shape.
[13554-13555]
3554
tribution of hornbeam is
related to soil, it being more
abundant in the acid areas.
It occurs only as large coppice.
9. Rare conjunction of hornbeam
and lime.
10. Cherry generally frequent as
standards and large poles.
A few very large trees. This
must be a phenomenon of
the last century. Perhaps the
largest concentration of cherry
in E. Anglian woods (save Arger
Fen).
11. Holly frequent.
12. Melica remarkably frequent,
especially on earthworks.
13. Castanea generally scattered.
14. Campanula trachelium freq.
3555
15. Bluebell unusually common
for Suffolk.

17. Elm invasion of both calcar-
ous and acid woodland, the
latter very unusual.
18. Large stools of ash, lime,
hornbeam. The largest lime stools
are round the edges of the lime
area.
[13556-13557]
2556
A very important pair
of woods, despite the difficulties
of interpretation. Vegetational
evidence for the woodland
being mainly primary is strong.
Some evidence of planting;
Castanea, ? hornbeam. But
there does not appear to be
a Hockering situation with
the lime, which appears to
have a "natural" distribution
and population structure.
