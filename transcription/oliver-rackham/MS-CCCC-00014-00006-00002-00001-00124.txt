Cadge's Wood
Oak: hazel coppice
This wood is described on p. 9390-1
Lawn Wood (cont. from p. 9392).
It is remarkable that
there is only one elm area,
which is associated with
s[????] presumptive boundary
ditches (or possibly an old
trackway).

[9394-9395]

[DIAG]

[9396-9397]

Lawn Wood
Birch. Both occur in fair
numbers at the N. end.
Oak. Many very large
standards. Few stumps. Few
coppice.
Ash. Stools rather sparse
but large. In some areas few
& small.
Maple. Much less abundant
than ash.
Corylus v. ab. Some cut c. 10yrs
ago & now very dense.
Filipendula abundant in
clearings, but not in deep [????]
Some birch fairly recent
(? last coppicing)
[????] [????]
ab. [????] ground.
Numerous shallow unbanked
ditches.
Atrichum und. ab. in SE
section
Melampyrum pratense. Abun-
dant in light areas at edge
of clearing, not extending
far into the clearing itself.
Rubus sec. Corylifolii. Abun-
dant in the cleared areas
of the N. ride.
Primrose. Rare.

[9398-9399]

[DIAG]
The ground is not
markedly sandy but very dry
for an oxlip wood. No surface
water.
Epipactis prob. purpurata. [SYMBOL]
[DIAG]
[SYMBOL]1[SYMBOL] Tall elms to c. 18 in.
dia. NO oaks. Medium
sized stool ashes. No small elms
Ru cae
Oxlip (no mercury)
Sanicle
[SYMBOL]2[SYMBOL] Tall elms, some older,
possible hedgrow trees
Brachy sylv dom.
No small elms, but a few
suckers.
Small stool ashes; to [!!!!]44 x [!!!!]12
No hawthorn in either
Mercury in E. part

[9400-9401]

Over Wood.
[DIAG]
OVER WOOD
Along W. side is a definite
probably natural stream.

[9402-9403]

E. Handle (i.e. between county
boundary and main Lawn Wood)
Mainly hazel coppice
Ash rare 52 x 24
[????] freq. 40 x 5
to 8 poles per stool, to 15"
girth
Hazel stools not in
rows, small, dense, cut
c. 15 yrs
Standard small (to c. 1ft
dia.), elm & oak & ash
The largest area of
chestnut coppice nown in
Cambs?
The largest Filipendula
area in these woods. Not no-
ticeably wet.
Over Wood.
Main Wood
Oak standards large &
dense, spreading from
low down
Hazel dom. in coppice,
cut c. 15 yrs ago, small
dense stools.
Ash & maple patchy in
distrib. mainly maple,
small stools with small
poles. Maple & ash equally
ab. Ash 28 x 10.
Soil very soft where wet,
cracking polygonally.
Ash stools freq. in W part

[9404-9405]

Atrichum occ. ab.
This wood is on the
rather
whole on a [SYMBOL] steep S. facing
slope except for a small
plateau along the N. edge.
It has two internal valleys
or large gulleys.
Remarkably uniform in
trees and ground flora
(contrast Lawn).
Very little large coppice
and a large proportion of
maple in what there is.
Small coppice very regular
(though not in rows), looked
after until recently, with
hardly any scrub.
Ash standards rare,
usually of coppice origin, in-
cluding a magnificent
stool by the S.W. corner
which includes a full-sized
standard tree as well as
a number of living poles
and new shoots.
Ground vegetation quite
different from Lawn. Almost
all mercury. Oxlip is a
ride plant. Bluebells occur
(unlike Lawn) but are rare.
No birch and very little
hawthorn.
Over Wood is mostly
dry but not noticeably
so compared to Lawn.
The distribution of oxlips
in these woods appears
to be mainly in the plateau
areas.

[9406-9407]

[DIAG]
Over and Lawn Woods are
probably ancient woodland
with some replanting. The
floristic poverty of Lawn is

[9408-9409]

suprising.
Borley Wood.
The northern 2/3 has
almost entirely been
drastically felled and some
areas so stubbed that the
original woodland is un-
recognizable.
A small elm area
survives in the S.W. lobe.
The whole wood appears
to be very dry although
oxlips occur in the flatter
northern area. The natural
vegetation where it survives
is:
Mercury usually dom.
Blubells occ.
Bracken flourishing in
patches
Nettles occ.
The standards (which
appear not to have been
dense) apparently all went
many years ago and
were not replaced to any
large extent by re-growth,
except in elm areas. The
wood was therefore two-
-storeyed. Large & small
coppice well-developed,
ash stools sometimes very
large.
The elms were distinc-
tive. The small area of
large-coppice elm is unusual.
The large proportion of elms
and the numerous small
patches are both unusual

[9410-9411]

[DIAG]

[9412-9413]

for E. Cambs.
Rose-bay is very abun-
dant on the cleared areas,
most of which are overrun
[DIAG]
Deschampsia [????]
by tall grass, Agropyron caninum
& [????] [????]
The absence of earth-
works is remarkable.
It is not clear whether
the oaks were cut at the
time of the last coppicing
or later. Some of the
stumps have produced
poles.
The wood appears to
have been remarkably poor
[DIAG]
in species.
Borley was certainly
an ancient wood. It
may have had only few
standards and was long
neglected before its recent

[9414-9415]

S. end of Borley W.
No stand.
Ash small stools: forms a
well marked upper storey
occ. larger (50 x 26) ? 94 x19
Polyp.[????] frequent
Maple small stools less freq
than ash
Cr[????]t. mono. freq. hybrid r.
Nettle scattered in patches
Elder occ.
Oak occ. stool trees &
maidens. very few stumps
devastation. The intact S.
part suggests that the
hazel canopy, though dark,
has begun to open out.
Polyporus squamosus. Fre-
quent on ash stools.
An underground wasps'
nest was found in the
intact area.
The S. tip is very disturbed.
Borley Lane.
The S. end of the wood
is joined to the B1052 by a
cart-lane, rather sunken,
which runs between mas-
sive hedges.

[9416-9417]

Borley Lane
Melampyrum crist.
Rosa can.
Viburnum lant.
Ulmus glabra
Privet
Hazel
[????] mono.
Prunus spin.
Cornus sang.
Ash
Oak
Ball[????]
The lane soon leaves
the thin boulder-clay and
runs on chalk. The transition
is a gradual one.
Unusual spp in Borley Wood:
Centaurium pulchellum
Euonymus europaeus
Odontites verna
also a large number of weeds.
The distinction between
boulder-clay and chalk in
Borley Wood is not sharp.
There are a few chalk spp
e.g. Reseda lutea.
Balsham Wood.
Approached along a
green lane with massive
hedges.
Only the N. third of the
wood was seen. Rides very
overgrown.

[9418-9419]
Balsham Wood
Hornbeam stools to 46 x 26
large-coppice cut recently
In elm-hornbeam area only.
Large & small coppice both
cut c. 7 yrs ago
Ulmus glabra treated as
large coppice. In elm-hornbeam
area.
Ash stool 52 x 10
Elm-hornbeam area.
Dense large-coppice
recently cut. On high stools
(hornbeam much higher than
in Buff). Now in the dark
closed-canopy stage.
Newlycoppiced (2 year old)

Epilob. [SYMBOL] co-dom. in many
Ge[????] [SYMBOL] places.
Coppicing done much as in
Hayley. The density of stools

[9420-9421]

[DIAG]
is similar. Re-
-growth is better. The
ground [!!!!]flora[!!!!] vegetation con-
tains a larger proportion
of ruderals and a smaller
proportion of hygrophytes.
This wood is generally
[DIAG]
drier than Hayley, with no
standing water at present.
Of all the boulder-clay wood
seen so far in E. Cambs,
it is the least disturbed and
the most like the western
woods. It is better maintai-
ned than any W. Cambs wood
and probably for this reason
rather dark.

[9422-9423]

Epipactis (1) Total [????] 14"
biggest leaf 3 1/4" x 1 3/4"
7 stem leaves 3 fls
per. segs pale green
Outer part of lab. [????]
greenish pink, inner part
pale green outside, purplish
in.
[DIAG]
Stem slightly
& shortly pubescent with
short stubby crooked hairs
In coppice area.
(2) Large one in wood: 36 [????]
36" high, leaves g. 2" x 6"
50 yards E. of coppice.
(3) Large pale one in wood.
200 yards E. of coppice.
(1) is apparently E. Helle-
borine, though the leaves are
rather too narrow and the
hypochile is purple rather
than green inside, both of
which are characteristic of
E. purpurata (assuming this
to be E. sessilifolia of C.T.W.
1st ed.). [SYMBOL] no. 9
(2) is probably also E. Helle-
borine. [SYMBOL] no. 7
(3) may be E. purpurata.
The zonation of this
wood is rather like that
of the Sparrow's Grove group,
with mercury mainly marginal
but apparently determined in
part by waterlogging, and the
bluebell zone poorly repre-

[9424-9425]

sented.
Oaks show about the same
size-range as in Hayley.
This is certainly a frag-
ment of the ancient Balsham
Wood. The absence of scrub
and scarcity of thorns are
probably the result of good
recent management. Distur-
bance plants (ivy, Crat. mono.,
primrose) are absent from
the part visited. Such E.
Cambs plants as Carex pendula
and Geum rivale were not
seen either.
August 4-7. See p. 9432-42.
August 8.
Xerocomus chrysenteron.
In the garden of Middle-
ton Cottage, Sidgewick Avenue
near the house and not
under any tree.
August 9.
Several wet and stormy
days recently.
August 10.
The Sedum telephium is pro-
ducing some new shoots after
the old had been killed by aphids.
August 11.
The gourds are slow in
forming viable fruits; they go
mouldy at the flower end.
August 12.
The Heracleum has now been
cut and taken indoors.
August 13.
There are several flowers
on the Liriodendron tree at Leck-
hampton.

[9426-9427]

August 14. Part II mycology.
Brandon Park
(opposite Northcourt Lodge)
1. Rhizina undulata:
1-year-old bonfire site
clear-felled after c. 23
year old Scots. Replanted
with [????]. Bonfire sites
not replanted - no
killing. The sporophore
sits on a buff-coloured
rather spongy mycelial mass
running down to a stump
root.
Brandon Session Heath.
Left-hand fork of the
track running E. from point
"68" on map.
2. Peridermium [????] [????]
gray on the gall surface,
[????]pent. Frequent on
trees adjoining rides: kills
the top and sometimes
branches also.
Fomes annosus. [????]
killing gaps. In a
gap adjooining a ride
some of the [????]
trees along the ride itself
remain healthy.
Log infections.
Blue stain infection from
the end has to take
place within 2 days of
cutting, as the fungus
has little competitive

[9428-9429]

ability.
Cladosporium and
Alternaria have been con-
fused with blue-stains,
but discolour only the
surface.
Blue-stain infection
can occur through slashes
on the underside of logs,
but is mainly through
bark beetles. It is more
important in stacked
timber, in which there is
more protected surface
and in which spors
can be carried by
rain drips.
Radial growth of blue
stains is along rays. Hyph[????]
not cellulytic: blue colour
is in hyphae.
4. Ceratocystis [DIAG]
minor [DIAG]
On cut end [DIAG]
of log: black peri[????]
spouts bearing drops of
gray mucilage which is
very hydrophobic and
[????] function is obscure.
5. Clitocybe aurantiaca
Frequent under Scots.
6. Suillus granulatus
Ride.
One stump was found
which had been cur before
and produced [!!!!]a healthy
trunk. (P. sylvestris)

[9430-9431]

7. Paxillus atromentosus
Occasional.
8. Tricholome [????]
Rare.
9. Stereum sanguinolentum
Occasional on [????]
10. Peniophora gigantea.
On stumps sprayed [!!!!] [????]
months ago, has covered
up to half of the stump
surface with the gelatin-
ous mycelium.
11. Amanita rubescens.
Rare.
12. Laccaria laccata
Occasional.
13. Melampsora pinitorqua.
On young regenerating
pines. [????] lesions
on first-year shoots around
June: shoots then die uni-
laterally and bend round.
Uredos[????] extremely
abundant on Populus tremula
nearby. Small orange [????]
pustules.
14. Marasmius androsaceus
Frequent on needles.
15. Collybia maculata.
Occasional.
Of the pine diseases, Fomes
annosus is certainly the most
deadly. Peridermium is quite

[9432-9433]

frequent along rides, but
attacks only single trees. Melam-
psora causes only local dam-
age.
August 4 (from p.9424).
The Heracleum which
fell at Leckhampton con-
tinues healthy but has
gone mouldy on the dam-
aged tissues at the base.
It has set a poor seed
crop. Some of the other plants
have set no seed at all.
August 5 (from p.9424).
Hayley Wood (Nat. Trust's
perambulation).
An albino oak was
found in the Ditch Ride.
7 1/2 in. high. Much like an
ordinary oak seedling in its
shade form. 7 leaves, rather
large and flat, cream-coloured.
[SYMBOL]. No obvious etiolation.
A coppice pak occurs near
the S.E. corner.
In the N. section is a
group of six small maiden
oaks, 8 to 31 in. girth at B.H.
Notable plants:
Campanula trachelium (by
H. Meyer). S.E. corner. One
plant. 4 stems all bitten off
some time ago, now c. 3ft
high. 44 flowers, pale blue.
On the [!!!!]old boundary bank
now some distance in, under
moderate shade.
Hypericum tetraptenum. In
open places. About a dozen
plants in Hayley Lane at

[9434-9435]

[DIAG]

[9436-9437]

its S. end, a few in the
cross-roads glade.
Centaurium pulchellum. More
frequent than C. Erythraea.
Cross-roads, also frequent
on main ride along uncoppiced
plots.
Solanum Dulcamara. By
pond; also in 1966 plot.
Lysimachia nummularia. A
fringe round the pond.
Sonchus arvensis. Among
tall vegetation in pond glade.
Hypericum perforatum. On rail-
way verge, opposite Campanula
glomerata.
Silaum Silaus. Railway verge
next to Campanula glomerata.
Carex hirta. Hayley Lane.
Pimpinella magna. 2 plants in
S.E. main ride.
Carex remota. Abundant in
pond glade.
Alsima Plantago. Pond glade.
Dipsacus fullonum. Two in
the pond ride.
An hawkmoth caterpillar
(furry, with a horned tail) was
seen in the Glade.
