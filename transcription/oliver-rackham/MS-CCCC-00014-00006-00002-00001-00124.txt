[DIAG]
Cadge's Wood
Oak: hazel coppice
This wood is described on p. 9390-1
Lawn Wood (cont. from p. 9392).
It is remarkable that
there is only one elm area,
which is associated with
s[????] presumptive boundary
ditches (or possibly an old
trackway).

[9394-9395]

[DIAG]

[9396-9397]

Lawn Wood
Birch. Both occur in fair
numbers at the N. end.
Oak. Many very large
standards. Few stumps. Few
coppice.
Ash. Stools rather sparse
but large. In some areas few
& small.
Maple. Much less abundant
than ash.
Corylus v. ab. Some cut c. 10yrs
ago & now very dense.
Filipendula abundant in
clearings, but not in deep [????]
Some birch fairly recent
(? last coppicing)
[????] [????]
ab. [????] ground.
Numerous shallow unbanked
ditches.
Atrichum und. ab. in SE
section
Melampyrum pratense. Abun-
dant in light areas at edge
of clearing, not extending
far into the clearing itself.
Rubus sec. Corylifolii. Abun-
dant in the cleared areas
of the N. ride.
Primrose. Rare.

[9398-9399]

[DIAG]
The ground is not
markedly sandy but very dry
for an oxlip wood. No surface
water.
Epipactis prob. purpurata. [SYMBOL]
[DIAG]
[SYMBOL]1[SYMBOL] Tall elms to c. 18 in.
dia. NO oaks. Medium
sized stool ashes. No small elms
Ru cae
Oxlip (no mercury)
Sanicle
[SYMBOL]2[SYMBOL] Tall elms, some older,
possible hedgrow trees
Brachy sylv dom.
No small elms, but a few
suckers.
Small stool ashes; to [!!!!]44 x [!!!!]12
No hawthorn in either
Mercury in E. part

[9400-9401]

Over Wood.
[DIAG]
OVER WOOD
Along W. side is a definite
probably natural stream.

[9402-9403]

E. Handle (i.e. between county
boundary and main Lawn Wood)
Mainly hazel coppice
Ash rare 52 x 24
[????] freq. 40 x 5
to 8 poles per stool, to 15"
girth
Hazel stools not in
rows, small, dense, cut
c. 15 yrs
Standard small (to c. 1ft
dia.), elm & oak & ash
The largest area of
chestnut coppice nown in
Cambs?
The largest Filipendula
area in these woods. Not no-
ticeably wet.
Over Wood.
Main Wood
Oak standars large &
dense, spreading from
low down
Hazel dom. in coppice,
cut c. 15 yrs ago, small
dense stools.
Ash & maple patchy in
distrib. mainly maple,
small stools with small
poles. Maple & ash equally
ab. Ash 28 x 10.
Soil very soft where wet,
cracking polygonally.
Ash stools freq. in W part

[9404-9405]

Atrichum occ. ab.
This wood is on the
rather
whole on a [SYMBOL] steep S. facing
slope except for a small
plateau along the N. edge.
It has two internal valleys
or large gulleys.
Remarkably uniform in
trees and ground flora
(contrast Lawn).
Very little large coppice
and a large proportion of
maple in what there is.
Small coppice very regular
(though not in rows), looked
after until recently, with
hardly any scrub.
Ash standards rare,
usually of coppice origin, in-
cluding a magnificent
stool by the S.W. corner
which includes a full-sized
standard tree as well as
a number of living poles
and new shoots.
Ground vegetation quite
different from Lawn. Almost
all mercury. Oxlip is a
ride plant. Bluebells occur
(unlike Lawn) but are rare.
No birch and very little
hawthorn.
Over Wood is mostly
dry but not noticeably
so compared to Lawn.
The distribution of oxlips
in these woods appears
to be mainly in the plateau
areas.

[9406-9407]

[DIAG]
Over and Lawn Woods are
probably ancient woodland
with some replanting. The
floristic poverty of Lawn is

[9408-9409]

suprising.
Borley Wood.
The northern 2/3 has
almost entirely been
drastically felled and some
areas so stubbed that the
original woodland is un-
recognizable.
A small elm area
survives in the S.W. lobe.
Thw whole wood appears
to be very dry although
oxlips occur in the flatter
northern area. The natural
vegetation where it survives
is:
Mercury usually dom.
Blubells occ.
Bracken flourishing in
patches
Nettles occ.
The standards (which
appear not to have been
dense) apparently all went
many years ago and
were not replaced to any
large extent by re-growth,
except in elm areas. The
wood was therefore two-
-storeyed. Large & small
coppice well-developed,
ash stools sometimes very
large.
The elms were distinc-
tive. The small area of
large-coppice elm is unusual.
The large proportion of elms
and the numerous small
patches are both unusual

[9410-9411]

[9412-9413]

for E. Cambs.
Rose-bay is very abun-
dant on the cleared areas,
most of which are overrun
[DIAG]
Deschampsia [????]
by tall grass, Agropyron caninum
& [????] [????]
The absence of earth-
works is remarkable.
It is not clear whether
the oaks were cut at the
time of the last coppicing
or later. Some of the
stumps have produced
poles.
The wood appears to
have been remarkably poor
[DIAG]
in species.
Borley was certainly
an ancient wood. It
may have had only few
standards and was long
neglected before its recent
