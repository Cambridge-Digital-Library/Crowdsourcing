Ridge behind Fournon Khorifi
   This consists of a number
of sandstone hills running in
a general N.E. direction but
complex in detail.  Some areas
of marl.
   Both sandstone x marl are
much eroded to a depth of
at least a foot (as shown by
surviving raised areas) and
no soil exists over most of
the area.  There is usually a
thin surface deposit of pebbles.
   Vegetation mainly low bush
of Coridothymus & Cistus with
frequent taller calycotome.
Andropogon the most frequent
herb.
   Pines frequent especially on
603
the abrupt N. facing crags.
None more than c. 30 ft high
and probably not more thsn 
20 years old.  A very few
stumps of bigger ones inclu-
ding one on the dry hill.
   Near the sea there 
are several very lopsided
carob x pine trees suggesting
that S.W. winds may be a
major cause of treelessness.
   Woody vegetation on this
ridge is seldom more than
2/3 closed except on N. facing
slopes.
   Silty pans of the "well
saddle" type are frequent in
the seaward region.

 Roadside vegetation.
   Consists chiefly of tall
 thistles, which line the road.
 Most of these are annual
 and all are now dead, ex-

  Salsola is particularly
