Two big branches have
fallen from the top of an oak
in the 1970 plot.
The 1971 coppicing was
finished today and much of the
work of reopening the drift
3907
alongside the Triangle was done.
About 45 people appeared
for the work-party and nearly
all stayed the whole day de-
spite continuous heavy rain.
This year's coppice is rather
thin and contains few ash
stools, none of them large.
December 5.
Hempstead is in a deep
valley with a stream running
the length of the village, on
which is a dammed pond.
Ruses is a large and
complete hall-house with one
cross-wing. By the house are
[13908-13909]
3908
several big lime trees, probably
Tilia vulgaris though with few
epicormics.
Hempstead Wood.
Colin Ranson; preliminary survey.
Owned or long-leased by the
Forestry Commission. Only the
N.W. has been coniferized (all
[!!!!]Scots)[!!!!] Corsican). From the remains
of its coppice this seems to have
been mixed hornbeam and
ash. A belt was left along
the N. edge but part of this
has been coppiced since, pre-
sumably to reduce shading the
field. Only a hedge and a
few scattered trees have been
left at the S.W.
3909
A pollard oak at the N.W.
corner.
Some sporadic cutting in
the N.W. unconiferized area.
About 4 acres in the E. were
cut this summer and autumn,
apparently as a preliminary
to replanting. This cutting
was done with a chain saw
to a high standar of coppi-
cing, and has been followed
by substantial regrowth.
Several watercourses, which
appear to be natural. The
bank along one in the S.W.
appears to be due to recent
ditching.
Only one ditched ride; the
main E.-W. has probably lost its
ditches through recent widening.

(N.-S.).
The E. side of the wood
has rather dense marginal
scrub in places, and a double
wood bank. A small patch
of Populis canadensis.
Lakehouse Farm is a
broiler establishment. A small
strip of woodland outside the
wood-bank appears to have
been taken into the farm
and largely destroyed.
There is another small patch
of coppice elm, apparently U.
glabra, on the S.W. side.
[13922-13923]

Crab just outside - said to
occur inside.
Features.
1. One of the largest stands
of hornbeam. Excellent trans-
itions from hornbeam to
"normall" heavy woodland,
affording some possibility of
interpreting the latter.
2. Wood-bank variable but
generally strong, except along
the N. siade which appears
to be much later than the
others.
3. Remarkable and obscure
series of earthworks on the E.
4. No other internal earth-
works save natural streams
and ride ditches.
3923
5. At least one considerable
stream.
6. Various types of structure
well preserved.
7. Standards remarkably
scarce. Oaks present only in
a small area of the S., perhaps
never general. Some elms.
8. Dominated by large coppice.
9. Small coppice sporadic, per-
haps and inevitable corollary
of hornbeam.
10. Hornbeam occurs only as
large coppice. Very little regen-
eration.
11. Wood last coppiced over a
wide range of years. Area
just cut commercially, with
good regrowth.
12. No acid areas.
[13924-13925]
3924
13. Elm areas of several
types, some quite complex, and
including excellent old elm
coppice.
14. Ground vegetation in gen-
eral of the E. Cambs type,
rather restricted by the hornbeam.
15. Site very wet to moderately
well-draied. Little surface
water seen today except in streams.
16. Frequent surface hollows.
17. Fairly rich in trees and
shrubs.
18. Ancient woodland species:
mercury, [oxlip said to occur in
abundance], Hypericum hir-
sutum.
19. Some very large ash and hornbeam stools.
3925
20. Few exotics.
The evidence for primary
woodland is almost complete.
Little field evidence for the
internal divisions corresponding
to the multiple ownership sug-
gested by medieval documents.
The N. side clearly underwent
some pre-1805 reduction but
this cannot now be ascer-
tained in detail.

Mr Woodward
of Capel Manor
says that there
was a substantial
area of hornbeam
coppice in the boggy part
3929
of MPW at the S. corner.
Not recently cut because the
factory had no use for it.
(AH)
He also says that
glow-worms were abundant
some years ago near Wood-
house Farm (AH). None
have been seen recently.
About 1/3 acre was fel-
led by Jas Hart, C. Ranson,
O.R. (including a little
done previously) but not
cut up. Mainly birch &
hazel; some big ash. 3
maple stools with usable
poles c. 2in. dia. x 12ft
long.

Dec. 13. MUDLEN END
FELSHAM
About
45 people turned up for
the coppicing. Little was done
save cutting up & dis-
posing of the stuff al-
ready felled:
some tons of heavy poles
some hundreds of bean
poles & broach wood
c. 20 bundles of peasticks
small quantity of besom
twigs.
Morning very unsuc-
cessful because about
half the party had come
by mistake, were totally
inexperienced, did little
useful work, and kept the
others from working. They
3931
left in the afternoon and
things went much better.
Yesterday afternoon the
Hunt appeared while we
were working. They went
thro Felsham Hall Ride,
rather fewer thro Broad
Ride, many followers,
some mounted, along Crane
Track. Felsham Hall
ride is much cut up;
in general the vegetation
rather disturbed, and made
into a quagmire in those
places (opposite the bracken
y lode and opposite Bottom
Fell) where riders are
forced to keep to a narrow
track. Here it is quite
difficult to pass and would
[13932-13933]
3932
be impossible without
boots. Rookery Ride
has been traversed several
times this season and
the turf, much broken
up, tho' no deep hoof
marks. In Broad Ride
the riders, tho' less numer
ous, were much less
confined and damage is
very local.
4 oak stools in the
coppiced area, of which
one severed by somebody
despite marking.
Berula appears to
occur in quantity in the
ditch below the Fishpond
alongside MPW.
Mrs Hart says Elodea
3933
occurs in this ditch above
and below the Fish-pond.
Mercury is still green
in places.
Alder cuts much more
easily than any other tree.
Wood turns bright yellow in
about a minute and then
orange over a few hours, the
colour brighter on the stump
than the pole.
A brilliant morning with
much hoar-frot and rising
mist.

Dec. 19.
Privet is abundant on
chalk railway earthworks
near Risby.
[DIAG]
Coppiced by factory: ////.
Mainly ash & hazel. Cut with
bills. Very large ash stools,
probably slow growing, to c.
3ft high. Not many small
[13936-13937]
3936
stools. Little birch.
About 0.6 acre cut.
Coppiced by volunteers [SYMBOL]
(including C. Ranson during
the week, and C.R. and
myself today). Ash stools
few and large. In num-
bers of stools (less maidens):

Birch Wet-wood.
One stem of Betula pubes-
cens felled to-
day. One of a
group of c. 8 maiden trees,
c. 4in. dia., 17 years old.
The others of the group, and
all surrounding birches, not
affected.
Discoloured area buff,
water-soaked, fairly strong
lactic smell. Characteristic
shape in the middle of the
tree with digitate radiating
processes. One of those rea-
ches the outside of the
tree and is associated with
[13938-13939]
3938
a crack similar to those
in elm. The latter reaches
the outside of the tree,
though hardly viisble ex-
ternally, with an active
watery exudation. The shake
comes out in a slightly
depressed area. No flange.
Edges of discolouration
well-defined, slightly dark.
1. Coryne sarcoides. Several
sporophores up to c. 1in.
dia. on a rotten birch
log, Middle Fell. Irregu-
larly lobed & umbilicate.
Rubbery texture. Bright
mauve.
2. Mycena galericulata. Abun-
3939
dant fresh ones on old coppice stools.
Omalia occurs in quan-
tity on a big ash stool
at the E. cross-roads, just
coppiced by the factory.
In Middle Fell there are
two parallel rows of stools,
c. 12ft apart, which run
for some 50 yards. [!!!!]Maple[!!!!]
Rows mainly ash & alder
of varying sizes including
some very large ash. Stools
do not appear generally
to be in rows in either of
the recently-cut areas.
In Middle Fell there is
a patch of pure hazel
coppice with some large
[13940-13941]
3940
stools above ground, c.
4ft x 2ft, apparently pf
great age, looking like Ti-
lia cordata.
Hazel in the area coppiced
after 17 years is usually short
and think. Evidently it gets
partly suppressed in the early
stages of abandonment in these
circumstances.
Birch standards in 1970-1
area are about half pendula;
maidens mainly pubescens, stools
almost entirely pubescnes. The
latter is much the more useful
for besoms.
Wood still quite well
drained.
3941
December 21.
Some trees are being lopped
in King's Backs. Horsechestnut
with slight wet-wood symp-
tons in the heart of upper
branches. Ulmus vegeta with
normal dry odourless heart
wood, even where previous
pruning has left big branch
scars.

Slight snow which did not lie.

noon to form a layer about

sky, moon & Venus).
Cold-front day with inter-
mittent heavy showers. General
slow thaw. Maximum depth

Tagetes still flowers in an

Gulls are numerous.
One was seen chasing another
