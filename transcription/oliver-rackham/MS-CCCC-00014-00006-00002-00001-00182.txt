Two big branches have
fallen from the top of an oak
in the 1970 plot.
The 1971 coppicing was
finished today and much of the
work of reopening the drift
3907
alongside the Triangle was done.
About 45 people appeared
for the work-party and nearly
all stayed the whole day de-
spite continuous heavy rain.
This year's coppice is rather
thin and contains few ash
stools, none of them large.
December 5.
Hempstead is in a deep
valley with a stream running
the length of the village, on
which is a dammed pond.
Ruses is a large and
complete hall-house with one
cross-wing. By the house are
[13908-13909]

several big lime trees, probably
Tilia vulgaris though with few
epicormics.
Hempstead Wood.
Colin Ranson; preliminary survey.
Owned or long-leased by the
Forestry Commission. Only the
N.W. has been coniferized (all
[!!!!]Scots)[!!!!] Corsican). From the remains
of its coppice this seems to have
been mixed hornbeam and
ash. A belt was left along
the N. edge but part of this
has been coppiced since, pre-
sumably to reduce shading the
field. Only a hedge and a
few scattered trees have been
left at the S.W.
3909
A pollard oak at the N.W.
corner.
Some sporadic cutting in
the N.W. unconiferized area.
About 4 acres in the E. were
cut this summer and autumn,
apparently as a preliminary
to replanting. This cutting
was done with a chain saw
to a high standar of coppi-
cing, and has been followed
by substantial regrowth.
Several watercourses, which
appear to be natural. The
bank along one in the S.W.
appears to be due to recent
ditching.
Only one ditched ride; the
main E.-W. has probably lost its
ditches through recent widening.
