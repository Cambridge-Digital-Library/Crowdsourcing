       15 APRIL 1967
Dickleburgh Moor cont,
  H has a rather thick
peat mantle, increasing
rapidly in thickness to the
N.W.
   Section III is exposed
in a ditch.  There is a lens
or dome of shall marl, reach
-ing to some 2 ft below the
surface.  Antlers, probably red
deer, were founbd apparently
in the marl;  some frag-
ments were seen in situ.
At one point there is a
curious upturned streak
of shall marl.
  The peat isvery humi-
fied, with abundant [????]-
mites remains.  No large 
trees have ever been
  
[8934-8935]8934
found (Mr Draper), and
the smaller woody remains
belong, at least in part,
to recent trees.

History.  This area was one
of the Dickleburgh commons,
inclosed in 1852, but ap-
parently never ploughed
until quite recently.  Mr
Draper has been clean-
ing out the ditches but
not, apparently, digging
any new ones.

A small group of willow
trees in the S. part of the
peat region grows in a
straight line, apparently
from a single fallen trunk.
8935
Several toads were seen
in the ditch with the
shell marl exposure;  two
copulating, one a bloody
corpse.
There is a continual
flow in the ditches from
land-springs in the boulder
clay, including perhaps
some in the Rot Mills.
A Chara was seen in
the ditch to the S.E. of C.
On one of the fields,
vapour was seen rising
from the peat. The sur-
face was warm to the
touch (the day being
just overcast) and smooth
(with Cambridge-rollers).
The wind was light and
[8936-8937]
8936
the air cold.  Conspicuous
wisps of steam rolled across
the field.
An oxlip plant, transferred
when very smnall to the Dra-
pers' gsrden at Lodge Farm
Dickleburgh, has grown to
have 6 inflo and is flour-
ishing, though the leaves are
severely browned in the distal
part.

The purple Primula flour-
ishes ezxceedingly at Norwich,
it has been divided into sev-
eral plants now in different
parts of the garden.
Nicky has been out-
side but is not active at all.

April 16
Hayley Wood (Fellows of
Corpus Christi)
The oxlips are about
at their best, but flowers
are nowhere abundant.  In
the N. section, well over
half the infls have been
picked off, leaving a long pedun-
cle, but none were seen lying
on the ground.
Violets (V. riviniana) are
particularly abundant in
Hayley Lane.
Bluebells are just coming
into flower.
Deer tracks are very
frequent throughout the
Wood.

Hayley Wood (Mr & Mrs Palmer).
A black ladybird with
2 red spots was found in
the 1967 coppice plot.
  Mrs Palmer found several
last year's oxlip seedlings in
the 1967 plot near the N.
corner.
Oxlip flowers have a
pleasant  rather fragrant taste.
About 4/5 of the oxlip
[????]in the N. section have 
been nipped off just below
the flowers.  Deer are probably
mainly reponsible:
(i) Footmarks are almost
always found near the
affected plants.
(ii) Leaves are often damaged
(Mrs Palmer).
(iii) Flowers disappear altogether
(cf Eltisley).
  
[8938a-8939a]

a fox (partly buried in earth)
was found in the W. section.
The carcase of a young fox was
found nearby.  It had not
begun to decompose; there
were no signs of violence.
  There is much stsnding
water in the wetter parts 
of the N. section, following
prolonged rain earlier in
the week.
  Prunus spinosa is still
well in flower.
  The male mercury plant
is much commoner than the
female in the S. section.
The tree in rhe pond is
almost quite submerged, but
there is nonetheless a nest in it.

about 4/5 of the oxlip

mainly responsible:
(i) Footmarks are almost

(iii) Flowers disappear altogether

The infls to escape are
the later ones, which is probably
why the Hayley oxlips are ap-
parently later in flowering
than those of other woods.
  The hawthorn and hazel
layer of Hayley has a
well-defined bottom as well
as a top.
  Stercum purpureum is
abundant on the logs
cut and stacked in last
year;s coppicing.
  Ash canker occurs on
a few of the standard
trees of the 1967 plot, but
is seldom severe.
  Ranunculus flammula

  The oxlips in Longstowe
Wood are very numerous
and now past their best.
No sign of picking.
  There is a very consider-
able ditch st the present
boundary of Longstowe Home
Wood.
  Conopodium is abun-
dant on the "murder
bsnk" on the Longstowe
side, and between it and the road.
Old ash stools about
1 ft high are frequent in 
the Home Wood, but per-
haps [!!!!]not between the
"murder bank" and the 
road.

Velvet Bottom
   An area of rough 
grass in a dry valley.
topography very uneven,
probably because of mining.
Almost treeless, although
small woods occur in the
area.  At the head of the
valley is a small tarn, per-
haps connected with the 
mining.
  Grazing probsbly light.
The heath area of Ubley
Warren (p. 8819) is on an
adjoining slope and is rather
heavily grazed.
   Rock outcrops scattered,
mainly carboniferous lime-
stone.  No sandstone seen.
8947
  The slag heaps are
made of a black brittle
glassy material with a conch-
oidal fracture.  They are
slowly overrun by grasses.
Agrostis tenuis is not very
prominent;  none of the other 
characteristic higher plants
was seen.

Cheddar.
  There are spectacular
ivied cliffs in the gorge.
  In the churchyard is 
a colossal sycamore tree,
and a very large yew.

March 24 [cont. from p.8840].
Asham Wood.
   Oaks are mainly Quer-
[8948-8949]
8948
cus robur, though some
Q.petraea and hybrids prob-
ably occur.
   The wood is geolo-
gically comolex.  There is 
a deep red rather stony
soil on the plateau. Most
of the slopes are covered
with soil, but along
the S. side the slope is
very steep with projecting
rocks and scree.  There is
a cliff outcrop on the other
side of the valley.  On
the E. side of the wood,
the soil gets thinner. The
rocks exposed in quarries
appear to be all calcareous,
but vary in colour and tex-
ture and some may be
8949
metamorphic.
  Ash stools are very
like those in Cambs, but
usually medium to large
(a few as large as the big-
gest in Hayley).  Poles as
big as those [!!!!] in the 
N. section of Hayley.  Stools
2-3 ft high.  Often healed 
at the top.  Maple is scarce
and not coppiced.
   Hazel is much the most
abundant coppice and
the stools are large.
  Elms are localized.
  A few stools of Sorbus
aria occur around M nd
N.  Coppices like hazel but
poles straighter.  Bark very
dark.
[8950-8951]
8950
  Viburnum opulus is fre-
quent in the S. part of thr
wood.
  A few moderate-sized
oaks grow from old stumps 
in the S. part of the wood.
  The position of the
wood is clesrly determined
by slope.  The salient on
the W. side is in a deep
gully.  Only around F
does flatland run into
the wood, and then
only as a neck connecting
with the GH plateau.
  The wood is in parts 
surprisingly like those of
W. Cambs.  It seldom gets
beyond zone 5, though mer-
cury does not often form a
8951
continuous carpet Sycamore
and ivy local.
  Euphorbia amygdaloides
is frequent.  Allium urbinum
local.

March 27 [cont. from p. 8875]
Sedgemoor.
  Peat is dug not only
at Shapwick but also on
Westhay Moor, on former
pasture.
  Mrs Tripp, who knew the 
peat diggings frm childhood,
says thst it csn be got
as a fuel in Wells, but
now less than formerly.
The moor is cut to a 
depth of 4 ft, then left 
for a few years (presum-
[8952-8953]
8952
ably to dry out) and cut 
again.  It eventually regen-
erates.
  The peat diggings at
Shapwick are a flourishing
business.  Several acres of
the first cut were seen
laid out in rows for
the first drying, or stacked for
the second.  A light railway
and tracked vehicles are
used for extracting the peat.
No wood appears to be
encountered.
  Rough heath vegetation,
including Calluna, develops
on peat being left after
the first cut.
  No Sphagnum was seen
anywhere.
8853
Polden Hills.
  Natural vegetation is
rare;  there are a few samll
tracts of scrubby grassland.
Glastonbury
  The celebrated Thorn is
quite a young tree, like a
nurseryman's standard.  It
now has flower-buds and
almost fully-developed 
leaves.
  Venerable hawthorns grow
among the Abby ruins, but
appear to be the common
species.

  A few oxlip plants oc-
cur on the banks of the

South section.
   There is a considerable
area of ridge and furrow,
defined on the N. by a
bank and ditch, on the 
W by a double bank (ap-
parently a disused driftway),
and petering out on the
E.  To the S., the 22nd
furrow (counting from the

[8982-8983]
8982
N. bank) is the last one to
be recognizable, but another
group of ridges (parallel to 
the first) occurs in the S.W.
part of the section, so it
is very likely that the whole
[DIAG]
8983
W. half of this section was
cultivated.
   Present trees and shrubs
similar to those on the E.
sections.  Few oaks. Hawthorn
mainly monogyna.  Patches 
of P. spinosa.  Birch frequent.
Much ivy on the ground.
Herbs mainly B & M, but
patches of D. Much Rubus cae.
Large oak stools are fre-
quent.
  At the E. end of the N.
ditch is a large shallow pool
with abundant Solanum dulc-
amara.

Ivy.
On and near the banks of
the ditches of most of the
[8984-8985]

main rides, but seldom more
than 10 yards into the wood.
Occasonally on the outer
strip.
   Very abundant in much
of [!!!!] the S. section, parti-
cularly on ridge and furrow.
   Cowslips are abundant
on the main rides.
   Viola is mainly riviniana.
   Privet is widespread but
seldom vigorous.

West Sections.
   The entire N.W. section
(except for a few trees on
the W, side) has been felled
and replanted with a
mixture of trees, a high pro-
8985
portion of spruce.
   The same has happened 
to the S.W. section, save that
the marginal strip has been
left and under-planted, and
several acres at the S.
are scrub (mainly willow).
   Both sections contained
medium-sized ash stools.

North section.
Similar generally to 
the N.E. section, but with
less dense bushes.  Ground
flora rather dense, with
much Deschampsia and Rubus
caesius, and mercury in the
north.

Scrub.
[8986-8987]

crowns.
  Oaks frequent, to 1 ft
diam., growing up through
the hawthorn canopy; few
of pioneer habit.
   Prunus spinosa occasional.
   Ground almost bare.
Mercury and Arum the
commonest herbs, but both
very sparse indeed.  Bluebells
occasional.
Walk Wood (Cockayne Hatley)
entirely disappeared.
   The stomata of Listeria
 8987
can just be seen with the
naked eye.
  Ocl-forming bacteria are
active in some of the wet
willows.
  Seversl rabbits were seen in
the wood, despite the rabbit-proof fence.
Chlorocibonia aeruginosa.  Stsined

  Viburnum lantans ab.
  Ground vegetation of the
Potton types.
  The S.W. and N.E. main
rides hve been greatly
widened by cutting a side
clearing (c. 100 yards wide)
right through the wood.
Considerable clearing has 
been done on rhe N.W.
side of this ride. The
8993
