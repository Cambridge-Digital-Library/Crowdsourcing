       15 APRIL 1967
Dickleburgh Moor cont,
  H has a rather thick
peat mantle, increasing
rapidly in thickness to the
N.W.
   Section III is exposed
in a ditch.  There is a lens
or dome of shall marl, reach
-ing to some 2 ft below the
surface.  Antlers, probably red
deer, were founbd apparently
in the marl;  some frag-
ments were seen in situ.
At one point there is a
curious upturned streak
of shall marl.
  The peat isvery humi-
fied, with abundant [????]-
mites remains.  No large 
trees have ever been
  
[8934-8935]8934
found (Mr Draper), and
the smaller woody remains
belong, at least in part,
to recent trees.

History.  This area was one
of the Dickleburgh commons,
inclosed in 1852, but ap-
parently never ploughed
until quite recently.  Mr
Draper has been clean-
ing out the ditches but
not, apparently, digging
any new ones.

A small group of willow
trees in the S. part of the
peat region grows in a
straight line, apparently
from a single fallen trunk.
8935
Several toads were seen
in the ditch with the
shell marl exposure;  two
copulating, one a bloody
corpse.
There is a continual
flow in the ditches from
land-springs in the boulder
clay, including perhaps
some in the Rot Mills.
A Chara was seen in
the ditch to the S.E. of C.
On one of the fields,
vapour was seen rising
from the peat. The sur-
face was warm to the
touch (the day being
just overcast) and smooth
(with Cambridge-rollers).
The wind was light and
[8936-8937]
8936
the air cold.  Conspicuous
wisps of steam rolled across
the field.
An oxlip plant, transferred
when very smnall to the Dra-
pers' gsrden at Lodge Farm
Dickleburgh, has grown to
have 6 inflo and is flour-
ishing, though the leaves are
severely browned in the distal
part.

The purple Primula flour-
ishes ezxceedingly at Norwich,
it has been divided into sev-
eral plants now in different
parts of the garden.
Nicky has been out-
side but is not active at all.

Corpus Christi)
The oxlips are about
at their best, but flowers
are nowhere abundant.  In
the N. section, well over
half the infls have been
picked off, leaving a long pedun-
cle, but none were seen lying
on the ground.
Violets (V. riviniana) are
particularly abundant in
Hayley Lane.
Bluebells are just coming
into flower.
Deer tracks are very
frequent throughout the
Wood.

Hayley Wood (Mr & Mrs Palmer).
A black ladybird with
2 red spots was found in
the 1967 coppice plot.
  Mrs Palmer found several
last year's oxlip seedlings in
the 1967 plot near the N.
corner.
Oxlip flowers have a
pleasant  rather fragrant taste.
About 4/5 of the oxlip
[????]in the N. section have 
been nipped off just below
the flowers.  Deer are probably
mainly reponsible:
(i) Footmarks are almost
always found near the
affected plants.
(ii) Leaves are often damaged
(Mrs Palmer).
(iii) Flowers disappear altogether
(cf Eltisley).
  
[8938a-8939a]

a fox (partly buried in earth)
was found in the W. section.
The carcase of a young fox was
found nearby.  It had not
begun to decompose; there
were no signs of violence.
  There is much stsnding
water in the wetter parts 
of the N. section, following
prolonged rain earlier in
the week.
  Prunus spinosa is still
well in flower.
  The male mercury plant
is much commoner than the
female in the S. section.
The tree in rhe pond is
almost quite submerged, but
there is nonetheless a nest in it.

Hayley Wood (Mr & Mrs Palmer).
A black ladybird with
2 red spots was found in
last year's oxlip seedlings in
in the 1967 plot (near the N.
xcorner.
Oxlip flowers have a 
pleasant rsather fragrant taste.
about 4/5 of the oxlip
[????] in the N. section
have been nipped off just below
the flowers. Deer are probably
mainly responsible:
(i) Footmarks are almost
always found near the
affected plants.
(ii) Leaves are often damaged
as well (Mrs Palmer).
(iii) Flowers disappear altogether
