              WILLIAMSTOWN
21 May 1981   MASSACHUSETTS
   Planning of Williamstown.
House-lots of 7 acres allocated in
area of old fort. Rectangular grid
regardless of pre-existing roads
or topography.
Meadow-land in floodplain of
Hoosic River also subdivided into
strips at right angles to  the river. Each
lot comprises both sides of the river.
Further divisions of arable land,
of "pine lots" and "oak lots", of
mountain woodlots.
Some land to w. border was
gained from New York State.

ated with habitats on sites

Canopy c. 100 ft high.

Big white oak (C) fell '74, bringing
down 2-3 other trees & making
a glade; now overgrown by expan-
sion of surrounding trees, but has
also acquired a considerable
layer of s/maple.

Big falleb oaks replaced by
beech & s/maoke - oaks
brought down by winter NE
storms.

Reverse can happen through
repeated defoliation by the Saddle
Prominent. Causes s/maple to be
1449
replaced by oak. Acer pensylv
also benefits from caterpillars,
which eat it less than s/maple.
Red oak & s/maple [SYMBOL] 22
Red oak comes into leaf a
fortnight later than s/maple altho'
the leaves last later in autumn.
This puts it at a disadvantage.
Bdy between red oak & beech-
-maple dominance unexplained.

  Limestone pavement -  clints &
grykes - small decline. (One of the
few calcareous woods saeen in Amer-
ica).
  Several big maples have fallen in
the last 10 years.
  No visible boundaries. Has sur-
vived through steep slope & bouldery
site.

Easst Mountain
Lower slopes mainly oak (late
leafing) with some Sasssafras
(here near its northern limit).
Top of mountain has thin soils
on quartzite. Pine; burns every
2 years or so (suspicious origin).
(This is the mountain N.E. of
Williamstown.)

Sprout Forest Experimental Plot.
This 40 x 25 m area was clear-cut
in Feb 1978 to assess the potential
for cordwood production from Red
Maple (Acer rubrum) stump sprouts.
Red Maple was chosen for the
experiment because of its prolific
sprouting capacity & the low de-
mand for the wood in other uses.
Annual inventories of the vegetation
will clarify the dynamnics of the
forest's recovery & the impact of
deer browse on it

1930s, which have not prospered.

Land Values.            1459
£500 p. acre for average
pasture (30-acre lot). Woodland
would be less (because of cost ass-
umed on geubbing).
  Elm Disease prob. 90% - af

  Pownal is an area of scat-
tered farms with many outbuldings
framed and painted in crimson
ochre. Pasture-fields small & irreg-
ular, with small woodlota of very ir-
regular shape.
  Juniperus virginiana used

   Green Mountain was logged

Smal;l; groves of locust dom by
the Walloomsack river.

Lattice Bridge 35' span.

Timbers c. 9 x 2 1/2, conifer.
Silk Road Bridge
Crosses the Walloomsack River
in one span. Timbers all similar, 
set on edge. There are two
top-rails, each of double timbers.
Outside boarded over; also
about 8 ft inside at each end.
This bridge carries ordinary local
traffic. There is a second similar
bridge in the parish.

   Jerry Jenkins's House.
     White Creek, New York.
  Biggish frame house presumably

loadbearing  planks in partitions.
Plastered surfaces covered with
"concertina laths" - i.e. a thin
sawn board, cleft alternately
not quite all its length and 
pulled out sideways.
  Hewing by single axe-chops.
Large woodburning stove with
long stove-pipe. Little trouble with
condensation or tar - but it is run
hot.
[21464-21465]
1464
Skunk. The body of one was
passed on a road in Vermont.
Although the car did not run over
it the smell persisted for several 
miles. Smell has two compon-
ents: the stronger is acrid, re-
calling garage workshops and cig-
arette smoke, the weaker resembles
isocyanide. Both skunk cabbage
and skunk goldenrod have smells
rather like the first component.

Rabbit. One seen by the road.
Very like an English rabbit but
smaller, more lightly built, with a
longer tail.

Squirrels. Grays are abundant in
the Williamstown area.
1465
Elm disease
Poiwnal - see above.
Bennington: similar but perhaps
less severe. Two small groves
much devaststed; they had con-
sisted largely of elm.
Wiliastown.  big U., americanas
are abundant. About 1 in 4
dead or severe and many more
partly affected. Death-rate counting
those that have been removed
prob. 80%. Except along a water-
course, where elms have died en
bloc, the disease strikes scat-
tered trees here and there. The
trees are now in nearly full leaf
but no new symptoms visible.
According to H. Art various control
measures have been tried but
have only postponed the disease
[21466-21467]
1466
for a year each. Many dead
elms left standing. In the past
much attention has evidently
been paid ro wetwood in public
elms, with inserting drain-tubes
etc.

Elms.
   U. americana is almost
universal. When freestanding it
invariably has a Huntingdon-
-like habit with a sohrt trunk
dividing at 10-5 ft into several
great limbs which rise verti-
cally, often touching one another
for several ft before diverging
and arching.
This habit is so constant
among street elms that ir looks
like a cultivar. Wild elms of
1467
woods and streamsides, which
are usually smaller  do not usually show it.
It was, however, seen in one
big woodland elm in Vermont. 

     Hoosick Falls, New York.
This area is very like S.W. Ver-
mont but retains some pasturage.

pecker. Great pile of chips. Living

Big black bird with scarlet cap.
Peculiar cry.
These in rhe neighbourhood of
the holloway HI: an old road

the main Hopkins farm (of which
only the outbuildings survive).
It is still bordered by its fencerow

  Stone pile blocking road

  Ryelot is separated from former
pasture to the west. Ryelot is
mainly paper birch; pasture is
red (& sugar) maple. Boundary is
a row of black cherry & occ. bitter

red cedar or white pine. Pasture
contained freestanding s/maples

Moon Lot. Named after a former

only recently come into College

now become a mosaic of various
sec. woodlands with small open

tains. no very old trees. Patches
of cyclical regenersation simiar

due to caterpillars and possibly
ice-storms; hurricanes seem not to
be important.
Ice-storms. At this altitude do
not usually result in  permanent
curvature. Big trees are broken
in the top (occasionally giving
quite a pollard-like appearance).
Small trees bend and recover;
but this results in a characteristic
pattern of fine horizontal ridges
in the bsrk.

Boundary marking. The state
line is marked by square stones,
about 1 1/2 ft high at 200 yard
intervals; inscribed NY and M.
  Boundary of Hopkins Forest
marked by paint blazes on
trees, which are renewed at in-
tervals; the older ones are said 
to go back to the Hopkin per-
iod. Deviate by up to 50 yards 
from the supposed state frontier.

New York Statre. Nothing but woods
can be seen to the W.

Ski-run. There is a ski-lift to
the S. of Petersburg Pass; the com-
