              WILLIAMSTOWN
21 May 1981   MASSACHUSETTS
   Planning of Williamstown.
House-lots of 7 acres allocated in
area of old fort. Rectangular grid
regardless of pre-existing roads
or topography.
Meadow-land in floodplain of
Hoosic River also subdivided into
strips at right angles to  the river. Each
lot comprises both sides of the river.
Further divisions of arable land,
of "pine lots" and "oak lots", of
mountain woodlots.
Some land to w. border was
gained from New York State.

Big white oak (C) fell '74, bringing
down 2-3 other trees & making
a glade; now overgrown by expan-
sion of surrounding trees, but has
also acquired a considerable
layer of s/maple.

Big falleb oaks replaced by
beech & s/maoke - oaks
brought down by winter NE
storms.

Reverse can happen through
repeated defoliation by the Saddle
Prominent. Causes s/maple to be
1449
replaced by oak. Acer pensylv
also benefits from caterpillars,
which eat it less than s/maple.
Red oak & s/maple [SYMBOL] 22
Red oak comes into leaf a
fortnight later than s/maple altho'
the leaves last later in autumn.
This puts it at a disadvantage.
Bdy between red oak & beech-
-maple dominance unexplained.

  Limestone pavement -  clints &
grykes - small decline. (One of the
few calcareous woods saeen in Amer-
ica).
  Several big maples have fallen in
the last 10 years.
  No visible boundaries. Has sur-
vived through steep slope & bouldery
site.

Sprout Forest Experimental Plot.
This 40 x 25 m area was clear-cut
in Feb 1978 to assess the potential
for cordwood production from Red
Maple (Acer rubrum) stump sprouts.
Red Maple was chosen for the
experiment because of its prolific
sprouting capacity & the low de-
mand for the wood in other uses.

forest's recovery & the impact of
deer browse on it

sawn board, cleft alternately
not quite all its length and 
pulled out sideways.
  Hewing by single axe-chops.
Large woodburning stove with
long stove-pipe. Little trouble with
condensation or tar - but it is run
hot.
[21464-21465]
1464
Skunk. The body of one was
passed on a road in Vermont.
Although the car did not run over
it the smell persisted for several 
miles. Smell has two compon-
ents: the stronger is acrid, re-
calling garage workshops and cig-
arette smoke, the weaker resembles
isocyanide. Both skunk cabbage
and skunk goldenrod have smells
rather like the first component.

Rabbit. One seen by the road.
Very like an English rabbit but
smaller, more lightly built, with a
longer tail.

Squirrels. Grays are abundant in
the Williamstown area.
1465
Elm disease
Poiwnal - see above.
Bennington: similar but perhaps
less severe. Two small groves
much devaststed; they had con-
sisted largely of elm.
Wiliastown.  big U., americanas
are abundant. About 1 in 4
dead or severe and many more
partly affected. Death-rate counting
those that have been removed
prob. 80%. Except along a water-
course, where elms have died en
bloc, the disease strikes scat-
tered trees here and there. The
trees are now in nearly full leaf
but no new symptoms visible.
According to H. Art various control
measures have been tried but
have only postponed the disease
[21466-21467]
1466
for a year each. Many dead
elms left standing. In the past
much attention has evidently
been paid ro wetwood in public
elms, with inserting drain-tubes
etc.

Elms.
   U. americana is almost
universal. When freestanding it
invariably has a Huntingdon-
-like habit with a sohrt trunk
dividing at 10-5 ft into several
great limbs which rise verti-
cally, often touching one another
for several ft before diverging
and arching.
This habit is so constant
among street elms that ir looks
like a cultivar. Wild elms of
1467
woods and streamsides, which
are usually smaller  do not usually show it.
It was, however, seen in one
big woodland elm in Vermont. 

     Hoosick Falls, New York.
This area is very like S.W. Ver-
mont but retains some pasturage.

due to caterpillars and possibly
ice-storms; hurricanes seem not to
be important.
Ice-storms. At this altitude do
not usually result in  permanent
curvature. Big trees are broken
in the top (occasionally giving
quite a pollard-like appearance).
Small trees bend and recover;
but this results in a characteristic
pattern of fine horizontal ridges
in the bsrk.

[21490-21491]
1490
Oak peg 1 3/4", oak; fox-wedged
  An important road bridge over
the Housatonic River. Combination
of lattice and truss. Lattice is of
timbers about 10" x 2 1/2", with one or
more below the roadway. Truss is
of thicker timbers applied to the
inside of the lattice and pegged
to it. There is a concrete middle
pier, not quite in centre of bridge;
truss is asymmetric in conse-
quence. Truss contains two iron
rods. Possibly bridge was originally
latticed only; pier was then per-
haps added and then truss.
  About 14 ft wide. Remarkably
rigid; no appreciable movement
when lorry passes. Much used.
No weight limit.

  Foothills of Mohawk Mtn.
1 mi SE of Cornwall.
  About 40 ac. Trees said
to be mainly 180-200 y.

W.SW-facing slope of c. 20o.
Biggest pines are on lower slope,
some of them on  boulders. Height
gets progressively less up the
slope. The biggest trees are by
a roadside and very conspicuous.
  Said to be secondary wood-
land.
  At top of slope. There is a 
change to much younger woodland
mainly of oak abd sugar-maple.
  Appears to be relatively dry 
with acid soils.
  Only gaps havw been caused by death
of chesnuts.
1495
Goshen. Great swamp full of
dead white pine. Typha. Pines
all died suddenly; rather spreading
habit, were closed stand. Some open
water visible. Looks like the work
of beaver.

  Catlin Woods is on level
low-lying ground, bordered by
road on S and by low de-
clivity to a flooded area in W.
To N. and E. are tracts of evi-
dent recent woodland with a
mixture of broadleaved trees.
  Soil fine-textured silt or sand
with a few boulders. Humus ap-
pears to be mor.

[DIAG]

  Catlin Woods very unevenaged.
Biggest trees all hemlocks,
rather smaller than the big hem-
locks of the Smokies coves. Youn-
1499
ger trees are partly hemlock and
partly other species; other spp.
less abundant in interior.
  Many red oaks have reached
various sizes (some c. 2 1/.2 ft dia)
and then died.
  Standing dead and fallen hem-
locks are <5% of those living
but there is said to have been
much "salvaging" of dead trees
in the 1930s. Cut-off stumps
frequent, though not as big as
the biggest standing trees. Some
stumps are oaks.
   Chestnut was evidently
less freq., chiefly in middle of
stsnd now pure hem;ock. Stumps
all sawn off. There had been some
(?self) coppicing, stool of 4 stems
75" across. Replaced largely by
[21500-21501]

hemlock.
Woodbank. Low bank c. 9 ft wide
appears to form the W. edge of
the central stand. Symmetrical,
no ditch. Curving outline.
Between woodbank & swamp.
Strip of sec. woodland, prob. c.
100 y. old becoming dominated 
by  hemlock. Some white pines
in both edges of swamp.
White pine. Occasional emer-
gents esp. in S. of old wood.

There is dispute about whe-
ther the core of Catlin Woods is
primary. There is said not to
have been much logging apart
from a little "salvaging" of chs
etc in the 1930s. Some to-up
mounds occur, but are relatively
1501
faint.

Mosquitos. Large and very
vicious, not encountered before
in America.
  Litchfield to Hattford.
Almost entirely woodland.
Deciduous trees - oaks appear to
be prominent - with patches of
white pine. A few grassland
farms remain. Fence-rows
frequent.
  Rather suburbanized, but Litch-
field and other villages have
the usual nucleus with common
sugar-maple, and occ. American
elms. Timber-framed Congregational
church, etc.
  Occasional swamps & lakes.

        Hartford
  Large amorphous city. Vast
decaying railway station, apparently
still in use but all the ironwork
rustng. Many other decaying and
demolished buildings. Magnificent
state administrative building with
gilded dome.
  Said to be the most criminous
city in the States.

     Hartford to Springfield
  Mostly deciduous woods
with many factories & other buil-
dings concealed in them.
  Said formerly to have had much
Pinus rigida (cf New Jersey Pine
Barrens).

      Springfield
1503
  Amorphous city with vast areas
of demolition and of derelict tall
brick buildings.

Elms.
U. americasn freq. in N.W.
Connecticut. Prob. not much af-
fectrd by disease: the abundant 
dead elms of S.W. Mass. extend
S.E. roughly to Cornwall.
  Elms quite numerous in Hart-
ford. Disease infrequent. Three
elms side by side in street of Springfield
1. Superficially like U. procera. Trunk
