              WILLIAMS COLL.  1445
              WILLIAMSTOWN
21 May 1981   MASSACHUSETTS
   Planning of Williamstown.
House-lots of 7 acres allocated in
area of old fort. Rectangular grid
regardless of pre-existing roads
or topography.
Meadow-land in floodplain of
Hoosic River also subdivided into
strips at right angles to  the river. Each
lot comprises both sides of the river.
Further divisions of arable land,
of "pine lots" and "oak lots", of
mountain woodlots.
Some land to w. border was
gained from New York State.

HOPKINS FOREST
European honeysuckle associ-
ated with habitats on sites
Ulnus americana by stream,
[21446-21447]

not suckering.

1935 old-field invaded by
sugsar-maple (unusual). Dead
butternut. Grape freq
      Beinecke Stand (A)
12 acres of old-growth on E-
-facing slope.

 B (A) c. 5% s/maple
 occ. fallen - fallen trees blown apart
 and taken away in surveys. Records
 of trees fallen in 1988 hurricane.

involves extrapolation
Vines freq., to c. 4" dia. prob.labrusca
White ash D (c)
Blk birch occ. C
Canopy c. 100 ft high.

Big white oak (C) fell '74, bringing
down 2-3 other trees & making
a glade; now overgrown by expan-
sion of surrounding trees, but has
also acquired a considerable
layer of s/maple.

Big falleb oaks replaced by
beech & s/maoke - oaks
brought down by winter NE
storms.

Reverse can happen through
repeated defoliation by the Saddle
Prominent. Causes s/maple to be
1449
replaced by oak. Acer pensylv
also benefits from caterpillars,
which eat it less than s/maple.
Red oak & s/maple [SYMBOL] 22
Red oak comes into leaf a
fortnight later than s/maple altho'
the leaves last later in autumn.
This puts it at a disadvantage.
Bdy between red oak & beech-
-maple dominance unexplained.

  Limestone pavement -  clints &
grykes - small decline. (One of the
few calcareous woods saeen in Amer-
ica).
  Several big maples have fallen in
the last 10 years.
  No visible boundaries. Has sur-
vived through steep slope & bouldery
site.
[21450-21451]

Easst Mountain
Lower slopes mainly oak (late
leafing) with some Sasssafras
(here near its northern limit).
Top of mountain has thin soils
on quartzite. Pine; burns every
2 years or so (suspicious origin).
(This is the mountain N.E. of
Williamstown.)

      Hopkins Forest cont.
Once a large and prosperous
farm; has since been an experimen-
tal research forest, but ceded to
Williams College in 1968. Contains
the remains of many experimental
plantations.

Thin but cont. u/storey of red
& [????] maple.
Chs stumps
Strong wetwood ridge on
one big oak.
(E) N. half of 3210 approx.
Sprout Forest Experimental Plot.
This 40 x 25 m area was clear-cut
in Feb 1978 to assess the potential
for cordwood production from Red
Maple (Acer rubrum) stump sprouts.
Red Maple was chosen for the
experiment because of its prolific
sprouting capacity & the low de-
mand for the wood in other uses.
Annual inventories of the vegetation
will clarify the dynamnics of the
forest's recovery & the impact of
deer browse on it
  Previously polesized, c. 4" [SYMBOL]

Huckleberry may come from

Fire-cherry much attacked by
[????] caterpillers
Betula alley. Seems to be 
quite unbrowsed and is thus

Most red maples produce a multi-
tude of stems which have been
eaten back each year and are
now seldom over 4 ft high.

caterpillers.

Land Values.            1459
Â£500 p. acre for average
pasture (30-acre lot). Woodland
would be less (because of cost ass-
umed on geubbing).
  Elm Disease prob. 90% - af
fects even elms c. 15 ft high in
pasture successin.
  Pownal is an area of scat-
tered farms with many outbuldings

regular shape.
