11 May.
  A hedgehog was seen pottering
around on the sidewalk in Sidg-
wick Avenue c. 10 p.m. It was
taken to the middle of the gardens
of the Sidgwick Site and released.
  All the elms by the Roman 
Catholic Church have been cut
down: about 12  trees, p-type,
from c. 1 ft dia. upwards. Not
affected by DED. The largest
was some 3 ft dia., somewhat
rotten (lost its top many years
ago). Slight DED stain and
tyloses in earlywood of 64th
ring back (i.e. 1914).
  Two rooks' nests in London
planes in Lensfield Road by the
Chemical Laboratory.

Oxlips. One large plant in

road near Bradfield Lodge, c.
300 yds S. of middle of Link 
Wood.

Dry rot at Stylers' house,
Middleton Cottage.
  Originated in a skirting-board,
which is rotten for several feet of
its length. [!!!!] A series
of sporophores has grown out from
between the skirting and the floor-
boards - the latter not rotten -
and has crept out over the floor
up to c. 4" dia. Khaki-coloured
with broad cream-coloured mar-
gin, typical meruline smell. One
of these encountered the leg of
8881
a small delicate Regency mahog-
any table and encircled it with-
out affecting it.
  The origin of the outbreak is
not clesr. The skirting-board is
on an outside wall, with s gravel
forecourt outside, below the level 
of the floor. It appears to be
an early (late-Victorian) cavity
wall; the ventilation is not ob-
viously blocked.

  At Boxworth a fruiting spe-
cimen was taken  from a  typical
Boxworth elm on the S.E. side in
the middle of the village

  Of the innumerable elms
in Boxworth about 1% appear
to be dead. They are mostly of
the Boxworth type with little Up.
  In Elsworth about 10% of
elms are dead - mainly Up.
  The field immediately S. of
Elsworth, on the way to Elsworth

  The holloway from Ballingham
Grove to Heany Street is about 1/2
mile long, some 12 ft wide, with
cliff sides to c. 15 ft high.  In one
place chalk is exposed in the
bottom.

Geranium lucidum.
   In a narrow (8 ft wide) and
very steep holloway between 
Lamarsh and Shrub's Farm, 891-
353. It lines the road intermit-
tently for some 200 yards, on
almost vertical gravelly banks
with rather dwarfed Anthriscus
and grasses etc. Plants are
usually highest st the middle of the
bank, somewhat dwarfed near
the bottom, but such plants as
8897
[DIAG]
are in the very bottom of the
holloway are 1-3 ft high.
Flowers copiously. Appears to be
fairly competitive. Not NGS.
   Almost exclusively on the
E. facing side; there are only
a few patches on the W. facing
slope.
   A very gregarious plant.

Tilia cordata.

E. of Shrub's Farm, Lamarsh,

Still sheep (with a shepherd's

of Chalkeney Wood.

CHALKENEY WOOD.
8899
  The way from White Colne
to Lamarsh via Point 164, Fish-
pits, Peyton Hall, Horne's Green,
Speck's Fm is a splendid
series of narrow lanes, many
of them holloways through
hlly country, much of it per-
manent grass.  Innumerable
elms, mostly small-leaved minor
or ploitii, in good condition.
Mixed or elm hedges. Many
scattered farms; also plotland-
like bungalows and huts.

Elm Disease.
Not severe in Chalkeney Wood,
apart from the death of the 
scattered glabra elms,  most of 
which perished several years
ago.
[18900-18901]

In Earl's Colne is a splendid
Huntingdon untouched by disease.
  Bures Hamlet, Alphamstone,
Lamarsh: elms very numerous,
about 3% ded.
  No new symptoms so far
seen this year.

Ranson's garden fence.
Post-and-rails with nailed-on-
pales. 3 oak posts, W post thought
to be of c. 1911, 5" x 5" rotted off
at ground level, leaving a pear-
-shaped underground
part relatively ude-   [DIAG]
cayed. Middle
post reduced to a
few fragments below
ground; a "godfather" spur, made
of chestnut was moderately de-
8901
cayed. E. post, serving also as a
gatepost, was [!!!!relatively] apparently
newer than the others
and still standing. Under-
ground portion enloarged,   [DIAG]
but substance largely
delignified and reduced
to a mass of rays and zone
plates. No sign of exfra decay ]
at ground level. this post-hole
is wetter than the others.
These were replaced by 5
oak posts, 4" x 4". of rather crooked

   At E. Bergholt it is at the
 foot of a N.E. facing churchyard
 wall. On the church tower, which
 is a stump some 20 ft high, it
 is abundant on the rather massive
 cap of the walls; plants
 rather small, turning bright
 scarlet. A few small plants in
 shade inside the tower.
   In holloway S. of Giffords

 signs of dryng off.
 Also on N  facing side of
[18908-18909] 
8908
deep holloway near the first
house in Polstead on the way
from Withermarsh Green.
  Evidently an early annual,
somewhat tolerant of drought
but with a tendency to north
aspects.  None of its localities
has any top shade.

Polstead Park
  Now cultivated. No very
large trees, except for a few
ancient pollards on the N.
margin on the wayto Boxted
(all oak).
  On the N. side are remains
of a park pale, Was apparently
no more than 3 ft high, of
cleft oak pales - mostly very
rough - at about their own
8909
width apart, set in the ground
nailed to a single rail between
posts.  Tops not pointed. Nails
modern. Said to have been
disparked in WW II.
The Gospel Oak is shown
in a painting oin the church,
said to vbe c. 100 y. old. It
was then a large upstan-
ding tree, dpubtfully a poll-
are, wirh two tall limbs, ther
larger one dead.  Still partly
alive. Now it cpnsists of some
big fallen fragments of trunk
and one dead staghead
branch.
Anthriscus neglecta
  Frequent in holloways
about Polsteaqd. Similarities
[18910-18911]
8910
to Geranium luicidium.

Elm Disease.
 First new infections of the
season noted at Flatford, on
young suckers of Up near a
dead stump.
  Between Flatford & Boxford
the elms are mainly c-type
and are little affected, the  mino-
rity of p-type are about
70% dead.
Fine pendulous       [DIAG]
elm near the first
farm on the Wither-
marsh Green road,  nearly as
long-pendulous las the Wald-
ingfield Elm: about half
dead last year. Leaf open
one taken 
8911
There is a field of rye at thr
S. of Gifford's Park.

GROTON WOOD.
Holloways at Flatford.
  The two ianes down fdem
E. Bergholt to Flatford are sunk
by up to 20 ft. Densely over-
hung with elms and other
trees. The cliff sides of the
lanes are undercut beneasth the
tree-roots n many places.
More than half the trees are elms,
most of which are dead and
have been felled.
  The material of the hollo-
ways is said to be redeposited
loess. It is bright ochre-yellow
and has the right texture.
[18912-18913]

Withermarsh Green. A fair-sized

  Several fine holloways abut
Polstead, deeply shaded by over-
hanging trees.
  Many big pollard oaks at
the roadside W. of Mark Wood
001376. This area has many
small fields of permanent grass
with high hedges and hedgerow
trees; even Mark Wood can
hardly be seen from the road.

  Almost finished renewing 
the Ransons' front paling fence.
Pales ansd nails of deal, well
creosoted. Posts of oak, an
exact copy of the previous fence
which was itself traditional.

Most ashes and Ulmus

perhaps damaged by caterpillers.
The great pendulous elm
NE of Waldingfield church,

drought over the last two
years, is in surprisingly good
condition, about 2/3 of it

higher beanch is now slightly wilted
all over, and there is some death
of epicormic twigs in the runk

ted last year probably in only one
branch, now locally withered in that

D: very large pollard Up (c. 6 ft)
slightly affected last year, now
obviously withered or wilted in sev-
eral places.
