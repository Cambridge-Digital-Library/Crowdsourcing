Oxlips. One large plant in
full flower in hedge on S of
road near Bradfield Lodge, c.
300 yds S. of middle of Link 
Wood.

Dry rot at Stylers' house,
Middleton Cottage.
  Originated in a skirting-board,
which is rotten for several feet of
its length. [!!!!] A series
of sporophores has grown out from
between the skirting and the floor-
boards - the latter not rotten -
and has crept out over the floor
up to c. 4" dia. Khaki-coloured
with broad cream-coloured mar-
gin, typical meruline smell. One
of these encountered the leg of
8881
a small delicate Regency mahog-
any table and encircled it with-
out affecting it.
  The origin of the outbreak is
not clesr. The skirting-board is
on an outside wall, with s gravel
forecourt outside, below the level 
of the floor. It appears to be
an early (late-Victorian) cavity
wall; the ventilation is not ob-
viously blocked.
