11 May.
  A hedgehog was seen pottering
around on the sidewalk in Sidg-
wick Avenue c. 10 p.m. It was
taken to the middle of the gardens
of the Sidgwick Site and released.
  All the elms by the Roman 
Catholic Church have been cut
down: about 12  trees, p-type,
from c. 1 ft dia. upwards. Not
affected by DED. The largest
was some 3 ft dia., somewhat
rotten (lost its top many years
ago). Slight DED stain and
tyloses in earlywood of 64th
ring back (i.e. 1914).
  Two rooks' nests in London
planes in Lensfield Road by the
Chemical Laboratory.

Oxlips. One large plant in
full flower in hedge on S of
road near Bradfield Lodge, c.
300 yds S. of middle of Link 
Wood.

Dry rot at Stylers' house,
Middleton Cottage.
  Originated in a skirting-board,
which is rotten for several feet of
its length. [!!!!] A series
of sporophores has grown out from
between the skirting and the floor-
boards - the latter not rotten -
and has crept out over the floor
up to c. 4" dia. Khaki-coloured
with broad cream-coloured mar-
gin, typical meruline smell. One
of these encountered the leg of
8881
a small delicate Regency mahog-
any table and encircled it with-
out affecting it.
  The origin of the outbreak is
not clesr. The skirting-board is
on an outside wall, with s gravel
forecourt outside, below the level 
of the floor. It appears to be
an early (late-Victorian) cavity
wall; the ventilation is not ob-
viously blocked.

  Ramsden Hill park has largely
disappeared though much of the site
is grass. Probably no ancient trees.
  A fine green lane passes the W.
side of Meep's Hole Wood. Possible
Roman road; the bend past the wood
is to avoide the head of a deep
valley.

of a pollard elm  (Op) c. 7 ft dia.
Pollarded about i8 ft high, with
four limbs again pollarded c. 12 ft.
Nearly all  bark fallen. Patched
with sheet lead.
  The lanes about Upshire have
many mixed hedges invaded by
elm and often converted to belts
of small elms, most of which
appear to be alive.

  Roadworks have destroyed a
strip of the N.E. belt around
Lolworth Grange.
  At Boxworth a fruiting spe-
cimen was taken  from a  typical
Boxworth elm on the S.E. side in
the middle of the village
street.
  Of the innumerable elms
in Boxworth about 1% appear
to be dead. They are mostly of
the Boxworth type with little Up.
  In Elsworth about 10% of
elms are dead - mainly Up.
  The field immediately S. of
Elsworth, on the way to Elsworth
Wood (318632) is full of hummocks
and hollows and probably repre-
sents an extension of the village.

28 MAY.
  The holloway from Ballingham
Grove to Heany Street is about 1/2
mile long, some 12 ft wide, with
cliff sides to c. 15 ft high.  In one
place chalk is exposed in the
bottom.

Geranium lucidum.
   In a narrow (8 ft wide) and
very steep holloway between 
Lamarsh and Shrub's Farm, 891-
353. It lines the road intermit-
tently for some 200 yards, on
almost vertical gravelly banks
with rather dwarfed Anthriscus
and grasses etc. Plants are
usually highest st the middle of the
bank, somewhat dwarfed near
the bottom, but such plants as
8897
[DIAG]
are in the very bottom of the
holloway are 1-3 ft high.
Flowers copiously. Appears to be
fairly competitive. Not NGS.
   Almost exclusively on the
E. facing side; there are only
a few patches on the W. facing
slope.
   A very gregarious plant.

Tilia cordata.
5 stools seen in hedges and
one in a wood in Alpamstone
and Bures Hamlet.

[DIAG]

E. of Shrub's Farm, Lamarsh,
at 350892, is a steep valley
of rough grassland with a patch
of scrub and furze.

Still sheep (with a shepherd's
caravan) in the fields to the W.
of Chalkeney Wood.

CHALKENEY WOOD.
8899
  The way from White Colne
to Lamarsh via Point 164, Fish-
pits, Peyton Hall, Horne's Green,
Speck's Fm is a splendid
series of narrow lanes, many
of them holloways through
hlly country, much of it per-
manent grass.  Innumerable
elms, mostly small-leaved minor
or ploitii, in good condition.
Mixed or elm hedges. Many
scattered farms; also plotland-
like bungalows and huts.

Elm Disease.
Not severe in Chalkeney Wood,
apart from the death of the 
scattered glabra elms,  most of 
which perished several years
ago.
[18900-18901]
8900
In Earl's Colne is a splendid
Huntingdon untouched by disease.
  Bures Hamlet, Alphamstone,
Lamarsh: elms very numerous,
about 3% ded.
  No new symptoms so far
seen this year.

Ranson's garden fence.
Post-and-rails with nailed-on-
pales. 3 oak posts, W post thought
to be of c. 1911, 5" x 5" rotted off
at ground level, leaving a pear-
-shaped underground
part relatively ude-   [DIAG]
cayed. Middle
post reduced to a
few fragments below
ground; a "godfather" spur, made
of chestnut was moderately de-
8901
cayed. E. post, serving also as a
gatepost, was [!!!!relatively] apparently
newer than the others
and still standing. Under-
ground portion enloarged,   [DIAG]
but substance largely
delignified and reduced
to a mass of rays and zone
plates. No sign of exfra decay ]
at ground level. this post-hole
is wetter than the others.
These were replaced by 5
oak posts, 4" x 4". of rather crooked
local oak, stil;l very  damp when
worked. Given 2  coats of 
Solignum, especially in the rail-
mortices.
29 May. Glorious hot cloudless day.
30 May. The same.
