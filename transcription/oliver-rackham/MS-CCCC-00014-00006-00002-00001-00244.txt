11 May.
  A hedgehog was seen pottering
around on the sidewalk in Sidg-
wick Avenue c. 10 p.m. It was
taken to the middle of the gardens
of the Sidgwick Site and released.
  All the elms by the Roman 
Catholic Church have been cut
down: about 12  trees, p-type,
from c. 1 ft dia. upwards. Not
affected by DED. The largest
was some 3 ft dia., somewhat
rotten (lost its top many years
ago). Slight DED stain and
tyloses in earlywood of 64th
ring back (i.e. 1914).
  Two rooks' nests in London
planes in Lensfield Road by the
Chemical Laboratory.
