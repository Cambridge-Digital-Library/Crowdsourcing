[9320-9321]

which are most of the
villages. Most of the area is
cultivated mineral soil (mainly
silt, possibly some lake marks).
THe patches of peat are
quite small and mostly
cultivated in strips of about
100 x 20 yards. These
vary in level suggesting cutting
to different depths. THe
highest parts (those now being
cut for the most part) are 
quite narrow baulks. the peat
is intersected by big ditches.
  Frogs are abundant in 
the ditches.
Rhynchospora alba
  Perhaps the last in
the area. Two plants were
seen on a recently-cut area
9321
about 3ft above the water
table, among heather about 
3 years old but still a 
rather open community. [SYMBOL].

Apera spica-venti. Rare in
the district. Edge of a potato 
field.

Leersia oryzoides. Among Poa
palustris and Calamagrostis
cf epigejos on worked-out
peat. 

This was from the middle of
the Barje N. of Podpeč. Most
of the Barje is agricultural
land. Soil nearly all silt, very
little peat. Some other unreclaimed
areas (inc. Andromeda) are said
to exist.

[9322-9323]

July 7. Kamniška bistrica E.
of Grohat, N. of Stahovica.
Drypis spinosa.
  Mainly in open screes.
  Forms big loos cushions
up to 3ft across.
  Visited by bees
  Has no particular taste.

  Drypis is rather elastic
but not very strong.
  Cuscuta Epithymum 
grows on Dorycnium german-
icum on more stable screes.
  Fraxinus Ornus & Ostrya
grow on more stable screes.
  Sedum boloriense occurs
on [????] on more stable

  Cyclamen is frequent on
the more stable screes.
  A form of Carduus nutans 
is abundant in derelict ground
near the bottom of this scree.

[9324-9325]

*Orobanche: Origanimus
roadside. [[????]alba]

  This Drypis is very similar
to the larger forms of that 
on Rab. Excavation (difficult
beacuse the scree is very near
its angle of rest) suggests that
the whole plant above the ground
dies in winter and grows
again from the buried shoot,
No seedlings were found.
A small one dug up was 
found to have a slender
and not particularly strong
tap-root descending to a great
depth.
  Asarum is frequent in
deciduous woods on the other

Ice Caves of Gradišče.
  Two of these were descen-
ded, each a broad shaft
about 100ft deep in the bottom
of a small hollow. They are
clearly collapsed caverns, each
partly roofed in. Awesome 
shafts run horizontally into
the rock. The roofed parts 
contain large masses of
compacted snow. The caves
contain areas of humus 
with abundant bryophytes.
These do not appear to
be incipient dolines.

Many bryophytes, including
the arctic Timinia, grow in
the caves. A certain amount
of rubbish, mainly bones and
bits of carcasses, but also
a horned beast's skull,
was found, but the vege-
tation is not particularly
"nitrophilous".

Plateau of Gradišče.
  Very undulating with
many dolines mostly middle-
-sized and with almost
pointed bottoms.
  Spruce mostly isolated
trees or small groups. Pinus
Mugo in small thickets.
Area mostly grassland,
rather overgrazed but rich
in species. There are
some small outcrops of
limestone.
  Arnica is abundant in
many places.
Sorbus aucuparia is
abundant and often
large.
  Salix glauca forms con-
siderable thickets.

[9330-9331]

The dolines have a
characteristic zone of more
acid flora (occasional
Nardus) around the lip,
and more calcarious plants
lower down. Calcicoles and
calcifuges are mixed to some
extent, but almost all are
herbs.
  Juniperus nana occurs
in some of the dolines.

  The Drypis screes described
above are artificially un-
stable through quarrying
for a lime kiln (running
on beech wood).

July 8. Julian Alps.
  The forests of the Sava ter-
races are very mixed and
mainly artificial. Spruce 
and Pinus sylvestris predom-
inate. Beech and other 
hardwoods are frequent, inclu-
ding Tilia cordata. There
is usually little undergrowth. 
Bracken is abundant.
    Nagelfluh crops out
near Podbrozje.
Castanea, Quercus petraea,
locally near Ljub[????]no
  Cornflowers are usually
infrequent, but occasionally
abundant in some fields.
  Corn crops in the Lju-
bljana plain are in the

following diminishing order
of acreage: wheat - barley - rye
- oats - maize.
  Mistleto occurs on pear
trees at Moste.
  Small tracts of Pinus syl-
vestris wood with Erica car-
nea occur on screes and 
gravels at the foot of the 
Karawanken near GoZd.
  The N. side of the [!!!!]

  Pinus mugo occurs up
to c. 2000m. in favourable
places. On stable soils it
forms closed thickets. Its
distribution on the oposite
mountain Mojstranka is very
patchy, perhaps from heavy
fighting in both wars. 
9341
Alnus vindis. Very rare in
Yugoslavia. Seen only in a very
restricted area at about 1800m.
on a sandstone outcrop on 
Pristojnik S.E. of Vršič (found
by Max Walters's party).

Potentilla nitida. Only in the 
Julian Alpps in Jugoslavia.
Seen only on this day, on 
rocks at c. 1900 - 2300m.

Juncus trifidus. Abundant
in the more stable sites on
Pristojnik, but not seen
elsewhere in Jugoslavia.

Ranunculus hybridus. Very
like R. Thora, and with a 
similar foully acrid taste.

[9342-9343]

Occasional on Korosica and
abundantly found on small
scree on Pristojnik. Said to
be endemic to the S.E. Alps.

Sedum atratum. Frequent
on Pristojnik.

Leontopodium. Found only
on Pristojnik though probably
widespread. In closed turf
of Carices at c. 2000m.
Frequent but small. Slope
not particularly broken: has a
path through it but is not 
very accessible.

Campanula Zoysii. On lime-
stone cliffs at B. Forms a 
carpet of small leaves in
9343
cracks in the otherwise 
smooth limestone cliffs. Not
unlike C. istiaca on the
city walls of Rb.

  Kernera saxatilis was
frequent on Pristojnik.
Several different Alche-
millae occur on and around
Pristojnik. They have definite
ecological preferences.

Linum julicum. A very hand-
some endemic on screes on
Prisojnik.
[SYMBOL]
An endemic Scrophularia 
closely resembling canina
occurs on screes on Pristojnik.

[9344-9345]

Sedum hispanicum. Common
on screes and in dry places
in the Steiner and Julian
Alps. Resembles S. acre but
taller and usually with a
dichotomous in florescence. 

Biscutella laevigata. Common
on broken ground and
stable scree in the Alps and
Balkans. Many forms.

July 9.
  Clematis flammula and
Lilium bulloiferum do not
appear to go beyond the
Karawanken Tunnel.
July 10.
  There is an interesting
hill country in the Liege area
9345
with deeply-incised meandering
valleys and steep hillsides
with Cornus, Artemisia
campestris, and other thermo-
philous shrubs.
July 11. See p.948 [DIAG]
July 12. 
The Paosiflora has pro-
duced three large egg-shaped
buds with the petals pro-
jecting well clear of the sepals.
July 13.
Lakenheath Warren ([!!!!]Peter[!!!!] David
Coombe [!!!!]Grubb[!!!![] and the Part II
class).
There is little evidence 
of rabbit damage this
year, except to Botrychium.
Silene Otites is flowering
quite freely outside the 
rabbit fences.

[9346-9347]

Several apparent warren
banks run N.-S. across the heath.
  Botrychium is particularly
good this year in the Grass-
land A exclosure.
  Cladonia sylvatica is 
more abundant in the more
acid grasslands and in 
Roff zones.
  The dead remains of 
Gentiana amarella are
frequent in the middle part
of the Warren. 
  This has ben a bad
year for the bracken, probably
because of frosts just
after emergence as well as
later ones. Much of the
"front line" of bracken running
E.-W. in the S. part of the
9347
heath is represented by 
isolated fronds.
July 14.
  A passiflora flower sud-
denly opened during the
morning. A most remarkable
structure. Inside the 5
sepals and 5 petals is a
corona of many purple
linear appendages
borne on a raised receptacular
ring. From the middle rises
a long androgynophore bearing 
5 stamens and the
ovary. Filaments flattened,
anthers directed downwards 
and hanging by a delicate
moveable hinge from the end 
of the filament. The 3 
styles bend down between 

[9348-9349]

the stamens (in the middle
of 3 of the 5 gaps) so
that the stigmas are on a 
level with the anthers.
July 15.
  The Passiflora closed at
night and did not reopen.
July 16.
  Two more Passiflorae
opened during the day - not 
quite simultaneously. The 
anthers and styles begin 
erect and very rapidly
curl over.

They are borne laterally on

apparent manner in the
axils of ordinary leaves.
July 18.
Chippenham Fen (Part II Class).
  Selinum Carvifolia oc-
curs on the main drove as
mown-down plants to within
150 yards of the entrance.
Leaves recognizable by horny
teeth. Flavour of carrots. Still
not in flower in the meadow

[9350-9351]

At about the word Fen
on the 6 in. map is an area
of fen mown about every 
third year. A mosaic of 
Schoenus and Cladium.
Carex pulicaris, Gymnadenia,
and Epipactis occur among
the Schoenus.
  The belts along the main
drove contain much larch
and spruce, some still flour-
ishing. They probably date from
the early 19th-cent. planting. 
The large alders appear to
have been coppiced once. 
  The 40 Acre Wood contains
much good Pinus sulvestris.
  The Kassas zones are 
well marked; the inner one
appears to have undergone
9351
further waterlogging which has
killed out some of the trees 
and replaced them with [!!!!]
birch. A large beech in
the middle zone had orig-
inally a pioneer habit but 
has now fallen over onto 
one of its large branches,
the ground having given
way under the roots. The
peat here quakes.
  An unscented Gymnadenia
x Dactylorchis (prob. ericetorum
or Traunsteineri) was found 
in the meadow near the 
corner of 40 Acre Wood.

  Insects were very trying

  The 1965 coppice plot
and parts of 1963 are diffi-
cult and dangerous to get
intoibecause of fallen
timber overgrown with bram-
bles.

  The Heracleum mantegaz-

becaue of the enormous
numbers of aphids which

The E. part of the wood
is probably a fragment of
ancient woodland while the
W. part may be an 18th
cent. planting. Among the
characteristic features:
1: Coppice structure much
more regular in the E. part.
2: Boundary bank orienta-
tion.
3: Crataegus ratio.
4: Castanea.
5: Distribution of ivy.
  The distribution if
oxlip is remarkable, especially
since most of the wood is
rather dry and on a steep
