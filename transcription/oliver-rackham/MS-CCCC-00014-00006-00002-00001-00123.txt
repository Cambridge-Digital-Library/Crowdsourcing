parts of the bog.
Carex Pseudocyperus

The basin of Ljubljansko
barje is flat with low but

[9320-9321]

which are most of the
villages. Most of the area is
cultivated mineral soil (mainly
silt, possibly some lake marks).
THe patches of peat are
quite small and mostly
cultivated in strips of about
100x20 yards. These
vary in level suggesting cutting
to different depths. THe
highest parts (those now being
cut for the most part) are 
quite narrow baulks. the peat
is intersected by big ditches.
Fogs are abundant in the ditches.
Rhynchospora alba
Perhaps the last in
the area. Two plants were
seen on a recently-cut area

about 3ft above the water
table, among heather about 
3 years old but still a 
rather open community. [SYMBOL].

Apera spica-venti. Rare in
the district. Edge of a potato 
field.

Leersia oryzoides. Among Poa
paluotris and Calamagrostis
cf epigejos on worked-out
peat. 

This was from the middle of
the Barje N. of Podpeč. Most
of the Barje is agricultural
land. Soil nearly all silt, very
little peat. Some other unreclaimed
areas (inc. Andromeda) are said
to exist.

[9322-9323]

July 7. Kamniška bistrica E.
of Grohat, N. of Stahovica.
Drypis spinosa.
Mainly in open screes.
Forms big loos cushions
up to 3ft across.
Visited by bees
Has no particular taste.
Also occurs at the edge
of such screes, where more
stabilized, with
Melica ciliata. Geran. rob.

Geranium Robertianum 
on these screes grows very
large, and has a masive
base with a long slender
tap root.
Drypis is rather elastic
but not very strong.
Cuscuta Epithymum 
grows on Dorycnium german
icum on more stable screes.
Fraxinus Ornus & Ostrya
grow on more stable screes.
Sedum boloriense occurs
on [????] on more stable
screes.
Cyclamen is frequent on
the more stable screes.
A form of Carduus nutans 
is abundant in derelict ground
near the bottom of this scree.

[9324-9325]

*Orobanche: Origanimus
roadside. [[????]alba]

This Drypis is very similar
to the larger forms of that 
on Rab. Excavation (difficult
beacuse the scree is very near
its angle of rest) suggests that
the whole plant above the ground
dies in winter and grows
again from the buried shoot,
No seedlings were found.
A small one dug up was 
found to have a slender
and not particularly strong
tap-root descending to a great
depth.
Asarum is frequent in
deciduous woods on the other
side of the road.

Homogyne discolor is 
a shortly stoloniferous plant.

Ice Caves of Gradišče.
Two of these were descen-
ded, each a broad shaft
about 100ft deep in the bottom
of a small hollow. They are
clearly collapsed caverns, each
partly roofed in. Awesome 
shaft to run horizontally into
the rock. The roofed parts 
contain large masses of
compacted snow. The caves
contain areas of humus 
with abundant bryophytes.
These do not appear to
be incipient dolines.

Woodland Plants in Caves
Primula Wulf.fl.
Viola biflora fl.
Chrysospl. [????]lt.fl
De[????]. fl
Primula elat. *fl.
Primula Wulfeniana is
in an inaccessible position on
small rock ledges high on 
the walls. The others are
on mineral soil and humus
Many bryophytes, including
the arctic Timinia, grow in
the caves. A certain amount
of rubbish, mainly bones and
bits of carcaoses, but also
a horned beast's skull,
was found, but the vege
tation is not particularly
"nitrophilous".

Plateau of Gradišče.
Very undulating with
many dolines mostly middle-
-sized and with almost
pointed bottoms.
Spruce mostly isolated
trees or small groups. Pinus
Mugo in small thickets.
Area mostly grassland,
rather overgrazed but rich
in species. There are
some small outcrops of
limestone.
Arnica is abundant in
many places.
Sobrus aucuparia is
abundant and often
large.
Salix glauca forms con-
siderable thickets.

[9330-9331]

The dolines have a
characteristic zone of more
acid flora (occasional
Nardus) around the lip,
and more calcarious plants
lower down. Calcicoles and
calcifuges are mixed to some
extent, but almost all are
herbs.
Juniperus nana occurs
in some of the dolines.

The Drypis screes described
above are artificially un-
stable through quarrying
for a lime kiln (running
on beech wood).
The woods opposite are
Abies-Fagus and contain
Asarum.
