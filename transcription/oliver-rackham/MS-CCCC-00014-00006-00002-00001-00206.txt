5 October 
1972
Lec da Crespeina.
Occupies about 1/3 of its
usual basin. Surrounded by
base mud with numerous rocks.
Occ. algal patches. Small tufts
of [!!!!]Deschamp[????][!!!!] ?Poa alp. towards margin
of basin.

Local blood-red streaks on
W. facing rocks of Sass da
Campač.

Φ: 13 Crucifix on Jéuf da 
Crespeina, Cir, strong L. twist.

Puez Čampani[????] a hill very
like Col dla Soné but having
a second peak not capped with
dolomite, is undoubtedly the

[16142-16143]
6142
highest point of the plateau.  Φ 10

Numerous vegetation cres-
cents on screes below the S facing
cliffs of Val Kedul.

All S. facing slopes are free of
snow, with brilliant sunshine, but
a good deal remains on even
insignificant north-slopes. Deep
drifts over the path above Lec
da Čanpač. The way up to
Jéuf da Čir is deeply covered
with hard snow and not safe without
rope. Gardenazza generally free.
Descent to Pedračes by Path No. 1,
which traverses a very steep hanging
valley. Very dilapidated state: difficult
to find, fixed ropes rusty and loose,
ladders rotted away.
