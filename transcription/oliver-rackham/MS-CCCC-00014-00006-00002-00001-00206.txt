Lec da Crespeina.
Occupies about 1/3 of its
usual basin. Surrounded by
base mud with numerous rocks.
Occ. algal patches. Small tufts
of [!!!!]Deschamp[????][!!!!] ?Poa alp. towards margin
of basin.

Local blood-red streaks on
W. facing rocks of Sass da

Φ: 13 Crucifix on Jéuf da 
Crespeina, Cir, strong L. twist.

Puez Čampani[????] a hill very

highest point of the plateau.  Φ 10

Numerous vegetation cres-
cents on screes below the S facing
cliffs of Val Kedul.

All S. facing slopes are free of
snow, with brilliant sunshine, but
a good deal remains on even
insignificant north-slopes. Deep
drifts over the path above Lec
da Čanpač. The way up to
Jéuf da Čir is deeply covered
with hard snow and not safe without
rope. Gardenazza generally free.
Descent to Pedračes by Path No. 1,
which traverses a very steep hanging
valley. Very dilapidated state: difficult
to find, fixed ropes rusty and loose,
ladders rotted away.

Mainly pastoral area with
numerous small fields, chiefly
squarish. Hedges in about equal
numbers of single-species

thorn with occ. ash), and
mixed. All hedges function as
enclosures and are well main-

Between Avesnes and the
sea the country is mostly
flat, with distant nucleated villages
and large fields in several.
Hedges few, only around villages,
mainly hawthorn. Numerous
poplar groves. No woods.
In some small areas
there is a tendency to dispersed
settlement with hedged fields
and frequent large woods.
