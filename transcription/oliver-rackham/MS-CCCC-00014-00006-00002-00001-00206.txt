highest point of the plateau.  Φ 10

Numerous vegetation cres-

All S. facing slopes are free of

Jéuf da Čir is deeply covered
with hard snow and not safe without
rope. Gardenazza generally free.
Descent to Pedračes by Path No. 1,
which traverses a very steep hanging
valley. Very dilapidated state: difficult
to find, fixed ropes rusty and loose,
ladders rotted away.
