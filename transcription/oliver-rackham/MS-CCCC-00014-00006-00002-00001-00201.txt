Fasciation of oxlip & ash
in area felled for replanting.

Myosotis sylvatica
A remarkable feature of this
wood. In great abundance in 
all the cu-over areas in 2nd
season after cutting; less fre-
quent in areas cut earlier.
Rare along rides; very rare in
uncut wood.
Indentification certain. Corolla
rather small, but lobes flat. Tube
slightly longer than calyx. Style
longer than calyx-tube.
Nutlets strongly bordered.

Scrophularia
S. nodosa and S. aquatica
present as coppicing plants.
A few plants seen may be S.

doubtful. [DIAGRAM]
