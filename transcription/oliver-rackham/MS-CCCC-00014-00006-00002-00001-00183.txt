Steventon - [????] building

[14025]

27 JAN. 1971 WAVERLEY HOTEL BANGOR

Dolgarrog N.N.R.
Woods on steep slopes &
cliffs of Ordovician.  Mainly
oak with much beech
and some other exotics.
Holly appearing.  Much of
the hillside between the Afon
Porth-llwyd and A. Ddu.
At the bottom of Affon Port-
-llwyd is a great [????] of
greavel & boulders brought down
in a dam disaster ealier
this century which destroyd
Dolgarrog.  Being colonized by
birch.

[14026-14027]

Oak woods at Pont-y-pant.
Unconiferized woods con-
sisting of an evenaged stand
of Quercus petraea with
bracken under.  No under-
-storey.
Dolwyddelan Castle.
A square tower with remains
of other buildings, said to be
built by the Welsh against the
English.
Above Roman Bridge Halt
is a vast tract of pine and
spruce woodland, growing fast
and straight except along the
side exposed to the S.W.
Coed Cymerau
"The meeting of waters".
Will Jones, Warden of the
Maentwrog Reserves.
Tainfall about 80 in.
Upper Cambrian & lower
Ordovician.
Whole Vale of Ffestiniog
is an SSI.
99-year lease of 65 ac. from
FI.
Most trees 115-120 years.
Said to be some tendency to
grow in straight lines (air photo).
No evidence at all of
coppicing.
No oak seedlings get
beyond 2 years.

[14028-14029]

Traps for acorns, acorn
cups, caterpillar [????], cater-
pillars.  Now run for 7 years.
The 3 earlier years (published
in J.Ecol.) show a large excess
of acorn cups over acorns, but
this is reversed in the next
3 years.
Small mammal traps set
bi-monthly for 7 years.
Considerable trouble with
habituation to traps.  Cyclic
fluctuations in numbers,
different species in anti-phase.
Rabbits are unknown on
the reserve since myxomatosis.
Ivy freq. up scattered trees.  No
carpet.
Rowan & birch regeneration.
Glade. Erica[????]Mili[????]ia
[????].  Surrounded by bracken.
Invasion of B[????]ila [????].
A wet hollow of
natural origin.
Expts on oak seedling survival.
Area with a second fence to
make it more secure against
sheep.
Treatments including
mpuse cages, mouse cages open
at the top, mouse cages let
into the ground, various
types of natural shade, nu-

[14030-14031]

trients.
Acrons left in different
positions on the litter.  Survival
recorded and eventually
dry wieght of seedling.
Without mouse predation,
acorns survuve best between
the litter and the soil;
if mice are present they do
best when buried in the soil.
ANother set of experi-
ments on the extent od defo-
liation by caterpillars, and con-
sequent effects on growth, in
different densities of shade.
A few tress were felled to
open the canopy; the stumps
coppice slowly (now c. 2 ft high).
Oak saplings up to 8ft
high inside the sheep
fence.  Others of similar age
outside c. 1 ft high, browzed
recently.  Few in both cases.
The reserve boundaries
are mainly artificial, stoutly
fenced against sheep.  (one
was found in the reserve
during the visit.)
The wood on the S.W.
and N.W. aspects is very
similar; tress rather larger
and less dense on the S.W.
Slopes c. 20[SYMBOL]-40[SYMBOL], well
drained and not flushed,
except in the bog.
Soils thin with little

[14032-14033]

[DIAG]

[14034-14035]

accumulation of litter.
Quercus petraea (no robur)
the dominant, and almost
the exclusive, tree.  Canopy
c. 80%.  Trees c. 30 ft
high and 12 in. dia., rather
straight (on N.W. facing slope
c. 20 ft x 9 in., rather
corkscrewed), an evidently
evenaged population.  Totally
uncoppiced.  No felling. A
few dead trees thro' self-sup
pression on the N.W. aspect.
No oak regeneration
except inside and near
the inner enclosure.
Ash and sycamore
very rare, mature trees only.
One pine.
Birch (pubescens) rare
except round the bog.  Mainly
middle-aged.
Rowan frequent as
saplings and young trees,
especially under oak canopy
gaps.  Hazel rare.
No other trees or shrubs
seen.
Ground vegetation:
Bracken sparse and patchy;
round the edges of the bog
up to 5ft high.
Erica cinerea loc. ab.
Milinia generally present
and often dominant, but
cover seldom >40%.
Bryophytes frequently dom-
inant.  The most frequent

[14036-14037]

include:
Sphagnum (green), loc.
dom. (blanket bog).
M[????]ium h[????]ium
Polytrich. co[????].
Dicran. scop. & majus
Rhytidia. triq.
Sc[????]pania spp
Te[????]ium frq,
Deschampsia flex. loc. ab.
Luzula syW. not seen
Woods on other aspects
are rather different (see
map).  The quality of the
S.E. facing wood is attributed
to insolation and shelter.
The dense bryophytes of the
N.E. facing slope are attri-
buted to steepness and
consequent lack of litter.
The grazed woods
around Parc Cymerau-isaf
are not very different
except in the height of the
ground vegetation.
Bracken is much taller
and denser on the slopes
S.E. of the wood and suppresses
all tree growth save birch.
A curious woodland type,
tho' common in the district.
The poverty of understorey and
ground vegetation are [!!!!] attri-
butable to acid soil, little

[14038-14039]

litter accumulation, and the 
sheep grazing which was con-
tinuous until the area was
fenced in 1963.
the present oak popula-
tion results from seed estab-
lishment over a relatively
short period in the mid-19th
cent.
In the field, this looks
very like secondary woodland,
either planted or established
naturally from a few older
trees at a time when grazing
pressure was reduced.  The
ground vegetation, as now seen,
is more characteristic of moor-
land than of woodlands and and
contains no definite woodland
plants.
Dr Dale regards it as
probably primary woodland,
the age-structure being
attributed to supposed logging
of the older trees, particularly
during World War 1.  The
stumps &c. are presumed to
rot down and disappear com-
pletely.
The povery of the tree
composition, even on the most
inaccessible slopes, is difficult
to reconcile with primary
woodland.
The rain is said to contain
appreciable C[????] - and SO4 -- when
the wind is in appropriate

[14040-14041]

directions.  Tress covered with
an abundant epiphyte layer,
but not luxuriant and appar-
ently lacking Ushea, Lobaria, tc.
Cladonia squamosa and
impexa are abundant on the
ground.
The mnargins of the wood
with heathland are ill-defined
and there is no marginal
scrub.
The river flows in a deep
gorge with cliffs on the S.W.
side.  Great rounded boulders
covered with bryophytes.
Ffestiniog Valley.
The bottom of the valley
is grazing land, usually good
quality and improved.
The wooded sides are
mainly Quercus petraea,
structurally like Coed Cymerau
with little undergrowth.  Ground
vegetation often dominated
by bracken.
Coed Maentwrog (actually in
Ffestiniog, between the Ffes-
tiniog Railway and the valley
floor) is an N.N.R.  Somewhat
base-richer than Cymerau.
Coed Ceunant is between
the Maentwrog and Ceunant
side-valleys, facing mainly
N.W. Complex, including old

[14042-14043]

conifer and beech plantations
among the oak.  Rhododendron
is a serious problem, dealt
with by repeated cutting and
by grubbing out (despite the
damage to the soil).  Poisoning
is distrusted.  The reserve has
recently been extended to include
the heathland on Pen-y-foel
and now totals about 1,000 ac.
Coed Caefali is another
oak wood with large bracken
areas.
