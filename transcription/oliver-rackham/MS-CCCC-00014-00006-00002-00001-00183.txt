                 BANGOR

Dolgarrog N.N.R.
  Woods on steep slopes &
cliffs of Ordovician.  Mainly
oak with much beech
and some other exotics.
Holly appearing.  Much of
the hillside between the Afon
Porth-llwyd and A. Ddu.
  At the bottom of Afon Porth-
-llwyd is a great cone of
gravel & boulders brought down
in a dam disaster earlier
this century which destroyed
Dolgarrog.  Being colonized by
birch.

[14026-14027]
4026
Oak woods at Pont-y-pant.
Unconiferized woods con-
sisting of an evenaged stand
of Quercus petraea with
bracken under.  No under-
-storey.
Dolwyddelan Castle.
  A square tower with remains
of other buildings, said to be
built by the Welsh against the
English.
  Above Roman Bridge Halt
is a vast tract of pine and
spruce woodland, growing fast
and straight except along the
side exposed to the S.W.
4027
Coed Cymerau
"The meeting of waters".
Will Jones, Warden of the
Maentwrog Reserves.
  Rainfall about 80 in.
  Upper Cambrian & lower
Ordovician.
  Whole Vale of Ffestiniog
is an SSSI.
  99-year lease of 65 ac. from
FI.
  Most trees 115-120 years.
  Said to be some tendency to
grow in straight lines (air photo).
  No evidence at all of
coppicing.
  No oak seedlings get
beyond 2 years.
[14028-14029]
4028
Traps for acorns, acorn
cups, caterpillar frass, cater-
pillars.  Now run for 7 years.
The 3 earlier years (published
in J.Ecol.) show a large excess
of acorn cups over acorns, but
this is reversed in the next
3 years.
  Small mammal traps set
bi-monthly for 7 years.
  Considerable trouble with
habituation to traps.  Cyclic
fluctuations in numbers,
different species in anti-phase.
  Rabbits are unknown on
the reserve since myxomatosis.
4029
Ivy freq. up scattered trees.  No
carpet.
Rowan & birch regeneration.

Glade. Erica ret. Molinia
bog.  Surrounded by bracken.
Invasion of Betula pub.
  A wet hollow of
natural origin.
Expts on oak seedling survival.
  Area with a second fence to
make it more secure against
sheep.
  Treatments including
mpuse cages, mouse cages open
at the top, mouse cages let
into the ground, various
types of natural shade, nu-
[14030-14031]
4030
trients.
  Acorns left in different
positions on the litter.  Survival
recorded and eventually
dry weight of seedling.
  Without mouse predation,
acorns survive best between
the litter and the soil;
if mice are present they do
best when buried in the soil.
  Another set of experi-
ments on the extent of defo-
liation by caterpillars, and con-
sequent effects on growth, in
different densities of shade.
  A few tress were felled to
open the canopy; the stumps
coppice slowly (now c. 2 ft high).
4031
Oak saplings up to 8ft
high inside the sheep
fence.  Others of similar age
outside c. 1 ft high, browzed
recently.  Few in both cases.
  The reserve boundaries
are mainly artificial, stoutly
fenced against sheep.  (one
was found in the reserve
during the visit.)
  The wood on the S.W.
and N.W. aspects is very
similar; trees rather larger
and less dense on the S.W.
Slopes c. 20°-40°, well
drained and not flushed,
except in the bog.
Soils thin with little

[14032-14033]

[DIAG]

[14034-14035]
4034
accumulation of litter.
  Quercus petraea (no robur)
the dominant, and almost
the exclusive, tree.  Canopy
c. 80%.  Trees c. 30 ft
high and 12 in. dia., rather
straight (on N.W. facing slope
c. 20 ft x 9 in., rather
corkscrewed), an evidently
evenaged population.  Totally
uncoppiced.  No felling. A
few dead trees thro' self-sup
pression on the N.W. aspect.
  No oak regeneration
except inside and near
the inner enclosure.
  Ash and sycamore
very rare, mature trees only.
One pine.
4035
  Birch (pubescens) rare
except round the bog.  Mainly
middle-aged.
  Rowan frequent as
saplings and young trees,
especially under oak canopy
gaps.  Hazel rare.
  No other trees or shrubs
seen.
  Ground vegetation:
Bracken sparse and patchy;
round the edges of the bog
up to 5ft high.
Erica cinerea loc. ab.
Molinia generally present
and often dominant, but
cover seldom >40%.
Bryophytes frequently dom-
inant.  The most frequent
[14036-14037]
4036
include:
Sphagnum (green), loc.
dom. (blanket bog).
  Mnium hornum
  Polytrich. comm.
  Dicran. scop. & majus
  Rhytidia. triq.
  Scapania spp

Teucrium frq,
Deschampsia flex. loc. ab.
Luzula sylv. not seen

  Woods on other aspects
are rather different (see
map).  The quality of the
S.E. facing wood is attributed
to insolation and shelter.
The dense bryophytes of the
4037  
N.E. facing slope are attri-
buted to steepness and
consequent lack of litter.
  The grazed woods
around Parc Cymerau-isaf
are not very different
except in the height of the
ground vegetation.
  Bracken is much taller
and denser on the slopes
S.E. of the wood and suppresses
all tree growth save birch.

  A curious woodland type,
tho' common in the district.
The poverty of understorey and
ground vegetation are [!!!!] attri-
butable to acid soil, little
[14038-14039]
4038
litter accumulation, and the 
sheep grazing which was con-
tinuous until the area was
fenced in 1963.
  The present oak popula-
tion results from seed estab-
lishment over a relatively
short period in the mid-19th
cent.
  In the field, this looks
very like secondary woodland,
either planted or established
naturally from a few older
trees at a time when grazing
pressure was reduced.  The
ground vegetation, as now seen,
is more characteristic of moor-
land than of woodlands and
contains no definite woodland
4039
plants.
  Dr Dale regards it as
probably primary woodland,
the age-structure being
attributed to supposed logging
of the older trees, particularly
during World War I.  The
stumps &c. are presumed to
rot down and disappear com-
pletely.
  The poverty of the tree
composition, even on the most
inaccessible slopes, is difficult
to reconcile with primary
woodland.

  The rain is said to contain
appreciable Cl- - and SO4 -- when
the wind is in appropriate
[14040-14041]
4040
directions.  Tress covered with
an abundant epiphyte layer,
but not luxuriant and appar-
ently lacking Ushea, Lobaria, tc.
  Cladonia squamosa and
impexa are abundant on the
ground.
  The margins of the wood
with heathland are ill-defined
and there is no marginal
scrub.

  The river flows in a deep
gorge with cliffs on the S.W.
side.  Great rounded boulders
covered with bryophytes.
4041
Ffestiniog Valley.
  The bottom of the valley
is grazing land, usually good
quality and improved.
  The wooded sides are
mainly Quercus petraea,
structurally like Coed Cymerau
with little undergrowth.  Ground
vegetation often dominated
by bracken.
Coed Maentwrog (actually in
Ffestiniog, between the Ffes-
tiniog Railway and the valley
floor) is an N.N.R.  Somewhat
base-richer than Cymerau.
  Coed Ceunant is between
the Maentwrog and Ceunant
side-valleys, facing mainly
N.W. Complex, including old
[14042-14043]
4042
conifer and beech plantations
among the oak.  Rhododendron
is a serious problem, dealt
with by repeated cutting and
by grubbing out (despite the
damage to the soil).  Poisoning
is distrusted.  The reserve has
recently been extended to include
the heathland on Pen-y-foel
and now totals about 1,000 ac.
  Coed Caefali is another
oak wood with large bracken
areas.
  Penrhyndeudraeth is consid-
erably suburbanized.
  A steam train was working
on the Ffestiniog Railway on the 
Portmadoc dam.
  The road on the Portmadoc
4043
dam is subject to a 6d toll.
  There is a considerable
area of salt marshes inside
the dam.
  The woods at Tremadoc
appear secondary: conifers
and oak.  [!!!!] 
  On Allt wen is a patchy
oak wood.
  Coed Tremadoc N.N.R. (not
seen) is on the rocks N.E. of
Tremadoc.  Much visited by
climbers.  Work has recently been
done to provide paths for the
climbers to get at the rocks.
This is believed to arouse
greater respect anong visitors
for the wood.
[14044-14045]
4044
  The railway from Afon Wen
to Caernarvon has gone, but
its bridges, poles, and signals re-
main (except on the LLanllyfni
branch).
  This area is fairly rich
grassland in rather small
square fields.  Hedges usu-
ally normal, funtional, well
maintained, commonly standing
on walls; but the hedge is
a more important component
than in W. Cornwall.  Hedges
are usually mixed, the chief
components being:
Ash             Ivy
Hawthorn
Blackthorn
Hazel
4045
  But pure hawthorn hedges are
frequent and pure blakthorn
occasional.
  Vaynol Park is the seat
of the second historical family
in the area after Penrhyn.  The
park wall is of schist, about
12 ft high, in excellent repair,
topped with a cornice of
knife-edged pieces of slate set
on edge.  The park cattle (not
seen) are said to be large
and white and very shy and
fierce.
     Further Notes
  Much of the area was
formerly owned by the Penrhyn
and Vaynol estates, which
[14046-14047]
4046
have both declined in recent
decades.  The larger, the Pen-
rhyns, made their money in
sugar and slaving and bought
up mineral rights at the
time of the parliamentary
enclosure (only of hill grazing,
their being no common arable).
The title to some of their
lands is said to be dubious,
e.g. they held some of them
for three lives and failed to
surrender them at the end.
This has caused difficulty in
selling the land until quite
recently.  The family has never
allowed access to its archives.
Labour for the slate quarries
came from the peasants dis-
4047
placed by the inclosures.
  Penmaenmawr and Llanfair-
fechan are said to owe their de-
velopment as resorts to Glad-
stone, who came here to fell trees.
  Foel Lus, Dwygyfylchi, is 
a steep conical hill with
much lichenized scree.  Lus
= bilberry.
  Conway contains a few
old timber-framed houses.
  The Conway Valley is mainly
improved pasture.  It is a
growing practice for farmers to
own two farms, one hill, one
valley, and to go in for
transhumance.
  The Conway is a broad
[14048-14049]
4048
embanked river.  Tales are
told of its navigability many
miles inland by paddle steamers
until quite recently.
  The church of Henryd
(771736) is quite isolated.  It is
a Cictorian building replacing
the isolated chapel at over 1,000ft
at Garnedd-wen.

Coed Gors-wen.
  Leaves of oak saplings
occasionally still green.
  The object of manage-
ment is to maintain the
reserve as a self-perpetu-
ating oak wood.  This has
met with very little success
as oak seedlings are very
4049
rare outside the glade.  Man-
agement in practice is lim-
ited to:
(i) Fencing.
(ii) Maintaining narrow rides.
(iii) Scything the glade.
(iiii) Destroying sycamore.
  Sycamore saplings are
uprooted.  Large trees are
girdled with an axe and
left standing, partly becuase
of the difficulty of extrac-
tion, partly becuase of the
value of the habitat of
standing dead timber.  No
poisoning.  Girdling usually
kills the tree, which takes
at least 7 years to fall;
but several trees girdled
[14050-14051]
4050
7 years ago have survived
and healed.
  The lower wood was
not visited.  The bottom
part is grazed by sheep;
the main differences are
lack of saplings and less
ground vegetation.
  The very complex and
partly scrub-grown fields nearby
usually have mixed hedges
including hazel.
  The Middle Wood is an-
cient and probably primary:
1. Large are apparently
without internal walls.
2. Very wet and much
dissected by streams.
4051
3. Comparitively rich tree &
shrub flora (for Wales).
4. Range of ages of oak
with a few very old trees.
5. Rich ground flora with
woodland characterisitics in-
cluding Asperula.
6. Traces of coppicing.

  The Upper Wood is less
clearly ancient.  The N. and
W. are probably secondary
and related to adjoining
fields.  The remainder
(apart from the "cattle pond"
could be primary, but this
is not certain.
  Bridges made of round
[14052-14053]
4052
logs (mainly sycamore) get
very slippery.  Driving in staples
is recommended as a re-
medy (W.M.).
Pen-y-gaer, Llanbedr-y-
-cennin, is a conspicuous
hill-fort on an abrupt moun-
tain.  Said to be surrounded
with chevaux-de-frise of sharp
stones.
The woods on the W. slope
from Pont Dolgarrog to around
Betws-y-coed are mature
4053
plantations, being chiefly one
of the Forestry Commission's
earliest activities (c.1925).
Many exotics were tried;
the most extensive are
Douglas, of which there are
vast areas now some 50 ft
high.  The land belonged mainly
to the Gwydyr estates.  It
appears to have been mainly
[!!!!] open hillside, with
some earlier beech plantations.
Small areas of oak wood-
land remain on the steepest
slopes; there is little evidence
that any was destroyed on
the site of the new plantings.
Some beech in places.  The
plantations are mostly very
[14054-14055]
4054
dark but in places a moss
flora recalling the Alpine
spruce woods can be seen.
The Blaenau Ffestiniog
railway still operates, perhaps
because of Trawsfynydd power
station.
  In the Lledr vally above
Bettws-y-coes are several
fine bridges: a megalithic
bridge built of huge schist
slabs (like those on Dartmoor);
some large stone arched road
bridges, and Cethin's Bridge,
a stone railway viaduct.
  Blaenau Ffestiniog and
Tan-y-grisiau are rather grim
towns of small terrace houses.
The hills around have been
4055
transformed by slate quarries.
The Oakeley, the only working
quarry, has excavated Rhiw-
bryfdir from 1500 ft down to 
c.600 ft in a series of 
gigantic terra-     [DIAG]
ces.  The 
towns are 
surrounded 
by heaps 
of waste slate several
hundred feet high, an
unstable pile of scree on
which hardly any vegeta-
tion grows.  Manod Mawr
is a steep and relatively
untouched hill.
  The top end of the Ffesti-
niog railway still remains,
[14056-14057]
4056
although cut off by the wa-
ters of the lower Sewlan lake.
  At Pen-y-cefn is a house
which contained the earliest
municipal hydroelectric gen-
erator in Britain; it remained
working until a few years ago.

The North Wales woodland reserves.
  According to Dale, Martin,
& Jones, the reserves are de-
liberately chosen as a graded
series of base-status from
Gors-wen to Cymerau.  The
field work was done by Emlyn
Hughes many years ago.  On
this basis the Conservancy
prepared a list of sites and
leased them one by one
4057
from private owners (only Cy-
merau from the Commission).
  Dale assumed that this
had been done for the whole
country and was rather
surprised to learn that sur-
veying had been patchy.
  
Hazels in the hedges at
Penrhos-garnedd, Pentir, are
just on the point of anthesis.
  Hedgerow oaks in Pen-
rhys-garnedd are about e-
qually robur and petraea, with
many intermediate in leaf
shape.
  The hedges in Penrhos-
[14058-14059]
4058
-garnedd are mainly of
4-5 species; some of only one.
  There is a strong tidal
current under the Menai
Bridge.
  In Llandysilio, Angelsey,
the hedgerow tress are mainly
sycamores rather than oaks.
  Snow lies above 2900 ft:
on Yr Elen, Carnedd Llywelyn,
and C> Dafydd, but not on
Mynydd Perfedd or Moel Siabod.
  A very warm day of
shirt-sleeve weather.
4059
January 28.
  Castleside and Peckforton
Castles, Cheshire, crown a
ridge of curiously abrupt wooded
hills.
  The Chester branch of the
Shropshire Union Canal is
much used by boats.
  2-ridge-&-furrow is
common in the Cheshire plain
and at one point runs through
the canal.
  All the big Midland rivers
are overflowing.
  Monks' Park Wood, Bentley,
N. Warwick, appears to be
intact, but is grossly air
polluted.
  The Oxford Canal is func-
[14060-14061]

tional and in good repair, as
also the Grand Union and
Grand Junction.
  A cutting in the chalk

Hayley Wood (deer fence, and
continuing the Triangle Ride;
Conservation Corps, 27 people)
  The Wood is much wetter
than a fortnight ago.  All
of 21 post holes dug filled
with water (2 out of 35 on
Jan. 17).  The water gushes
out from fissures & channels
in the top 9 in. and fills
to within 3 in. of the surface
or nearer.
  All the black-holes and 
hollows in the neighbourhood 
of the coppice plts are
full; most of the Triangle
wood-bank ditch and the
railway ditches; and hollows
on parts of the main rides.
[14062-14063]
4062
  The Triangle furrows are
still dry.
  Post-hole profiles not re-
corded becuase of flooding.
  A stack of ash poles,
3"-6" dia., 11 ft long, cut
in 1967 and left on the
ground, contained the following:
1. Coprinus radians. Ozon-
ium abundant on some of
the poles.
2. Polystictus versicolor, Very
abundant on a few poles.
3. Merulius corium.  Fruit bodies
on a few poles.
4. Mycena or Oriphalia sp.
A tiny all-white [DIAG]
one in immense
numbers on some 
[exclude  fromm list]
poles near the bottom of the
stack.  About 1 cm high.
P. hemispheric.
Probably Delicatula integrella.
  These poles were used
for the short sides of the
rectangle (except the corner
posts).
  The Great Pond is full
and slightly overflowing.
N.W. Corner.
  The entrance to New
Ride is slightly poached by
vehicles being backed in it,
probably when dumping tyres.
  The cutting from Mr Cox's
level crossing to Littlehound
Fragment is about half
[14064-14065]
4064
full of tyres, i.e. the whole
length filled with about half
the volume required to level it.
No tyres in the railway
land adjacent to the Wopd.

  One of the large maple
stools left uncoppiced in the 
1966 acre, apparently dying
but later sprouting epicor-
mically, has fallen over,
the root mat being about
9 in. thick.
  A member of the party
found a dispersed skeleton
probably of a deer, about
6 ridges from the N.W.
corner of the Triangle.
4065
  The log stack referred
to sheltered an ash stool
whose atems are now c.
9 ft high.
February 1.
  The river is high and

February 2.
Of the [!!!!elms1111] horsechestnuts
recently lopped in King's Backs,
one (apparently that which
is alleged to have shed a

narrow crotch with an in-
cluded fold of bark, further
weakened by decay. This
defect does not appear to be
present in the others. They
[14066-14067]

  The Stevenson Screen in
the Large Clearing (p.   )
had its legs set in the
ground. They have just rotted
through (nearly 10 years, ap-
parently no preservative).
  Along the road side of
the Old Wood and the S.W.
wood close is a row of
beech and horse chestnut.
Large trees branched from
near the base and now some-
4069
what decayed.
  Ivy growing up the trunk 
of an ash tree which snapped
off about 20 ft high in this
area has grown rapidly in
the resulting clearing.
  The "Ragged Oak" to the
N. of the photosite is dying
rapidly. A youngish tree
hemmed in by elms but not
overtopped.
  Wood not very wet. Some
standing water on the rides
only. Pond full.

February 7.
  Certain Sempervivums re-
potted and others moved.
S. styriacum x tiroliensis
[14070-14071]
4070
is apparently extinct.
  The pots have stood in a
situation exposed strictly to
the N. Much competition from
Pseudoscleropodium purum and
Bryum capillare. The latter
forms masses of rhizoids
especially between the pot
and the edges of the soil.
This plant also forms a turf
over the outside of the pot,
which can be chipped off in
sheets matted together by the
rhizoids which adhere to each
other but not to the pot.
They appear to be very effici-
ent at trapping dust and
