         Shapwick Levels.
[22678-22679]
2678
Numerous [????] or sandy is-
lands are visible around the 
edges of the level; they appear as
gentle hogsbacks running
generally WNW and ESE.
  Shapwick Heath was visited
around the peat factory 421404.
Water-table is now about 10 ft
below original surface.
  This part of the Levels is
partly semi-improved grassland
and partly woodland. Grassland
mostly grazed. Buttercups ab.

fence-rows mainly of hawthorn
and birch with freq. oak & occ.

Hedges of this kind are typical
of the peat levels.

partition in the classic medieval
manner with paired 4-centred doorways;
plank-a-muntin construction.
But the bu8lding is of 3 storeys.
\original door survives, combining
4-centred head wih strapwork.
This has been enlarged to fit
a larger, still 4-centred, arch-
way. The enlargement is in
pine attached by iron straps
& screws, and presumably of
the 19th cent. At the same time
the battens on the outside were
rearranged.
  A 19th-cent. print shows a 
house about the size of the present
but asymmetrical. The only 3-
-storey part was the present N-
wing containing the hall &
service-rooms.

Lycophyllum selenenic. Tuft
of new sporophores on elm logs in
the park.

Polyporus squamosus. New sporo-
phore almost certainly connected
to an elm beam, removed from
the house in the 1961 fire and
now rotting in garden.

[from p. 2699] discontinued because 
of damage done to trunk.

Haughley Oak. In walled garden of
the house. Great pollard Qr.
Said to be 30 ft girth many years
ago. About 10 ft pollard height.
Has split apart snd two great

2700
limbs are supported by brick
piers. Both of these were lopped
some years ago because getting
in way of other trees; they
appear to show about 150 rings,
but this is prob. not the whole
period since last pollarding.
There are 3 other great limbs
which stand up to 35 ft high;
their tops have been cut off,
probably after a stagheaded phase.
Complete cylinder of trunk around
hollow interior, Deathwatch
beetle. Rings prob. about 12 to
inch; some sign of pollarding
cycles.
  This tree is notably vigorous
and has made new pollard
stems c. 3" dia. since the lopping
of 2 of the limbs. It is not

specially burry.
Haughley part of park. About
half the trees in the OS are ex-
tant; they include several great
pollard oaks up to c. 5 ft dia.
Oak A - now stump
B - smallish ancient pollard
C - old pollard.
  No sign of the parish boundary
on the ground.
Ancient trees appear to be
[22702-22703]
2702
rather lacking in lichens ex-
cept for the great oak which
has copious sterile opegrapha
lyncea.

Elmswell part. Many Victorian
plantations. Grassland with
scattered trees including a few
ancient pollards and one said
to be Tilia cordata, recently
pollarded after it partly blew
down.

Woolpit part. Improved grassland
but including a few old trees
- many fewer than on 1904
O.S. These include the 2
hollies.
Beside the pit is an oak
(D) which stsnds on stilt-roots
2702
owing to erosion. It has several
vertical taproots from the periphery
of the root-mat.
  Most of the park appears
to be underlain by gravel.

  Oak E is a small, probably
very old, pollard. Near it are 2
old thorns.
  The Icehouse is not now visi-  
ble. Mr Williams has unsuccess-
fully excavated for it in the
hope that it might be under-
ground.

Rats & Mice. Mr Williams says
the house was much troubled by
them before the fire, but since
then they have had only the oc-
casional mouse, and they can

better than since 1976. There
has been no recent rain.

Weather. Another hot sticky
monsoon-like day. There was 
a great thunderstorm early today
- of which nothing reached Haugh-
ley. Heavy rain made the S.E.

impassable.
  The river has risen slightly

Myrtle. Big bush 10 ft high,

All leaves & twigs killed. Bran-
