1. Amanita rubescens. One 
in the forest near Les Michetons,
St Sulpice.
2. Boletus edulis. One 
measuring 8''x 6''x 3 1/2'',
Les Michetons.

3. Inocybe geophylla lilacina.
Occasional in the "Enchanted 
forest" on the path to 
the Col St Michel, after
the Col du Crucifix branch.

4. Lepista nuda. A few

washed-out specimens of
strophania aeruginosa), faintly
fribrillose, dey.
[TABLE] S. slightly dilated below,
dirty cream, tinged bluish,
slightly fibrillose, solid,
flushy, naked, white-
-mycelial at base.
[TABLE] L. adnate-sinuate,

probably white, but could
be pink or pale ochre.
[TABLE] C.thickish, white smell
mealy when cut ; the

whole fungus [DIAG]
however 
has a strong smell
of aniseed.
[TABLE] The wood on both 
sides of the Jura are
very similar floristically,
the differences in aspect 
bring perhaps compensated 
by the difference in soil.
The Aiguebelette side has
deeper soil on a less
abrupt slop. Beech and
hazel are dominant as

[6788-6789]

a managed coppice on
this side, but other spp
are abundant. Ivy is
an abundant ground herb.

[TABLE] The following fungi
were seen on sale in a shop
in Chambéry :
Boletus edulis (fresh)
[TABLE] 1500 F. le kilo
Boletus edulis } 
Gyromitra esculenta (dried)

[TABLE] There is a nest of
hornets about 20ft above
ground in a walnut tree
at Myans, in a small 
cavity in the trunks Altho'
only about 20ft from a

house, it does not seem to
be much of a nuisance.
[TABLE] Rabbits are said to be
abundant in the Abymes
de Myans, partly as a 
result of deliberate intro-
duction in nearby preserves.
September 13.
[TABLE] Near upper Barberaz is 
a hedge of leguminous
tree with bipinnate leaves
in the arils of which (actu-
ally a little above) are
[!!!!][!!!!] short shoots modified
as tremendous thorns
(some over 3 in.long), ending
in a sharp point and often
with up to 4 branches.
[TABLE] The first formed few
leaves on this seasons

[6790-6791]

[DIAG]
growth are simply pin-
nate. Occasionally there is
an intermediate leaf which
is pinnate below, bippinate
above. The production of
thorns stops abruptly 
about halfway. up the
shoot, and the last formed

leaves have only minute
points in their axils.
Long shoots occasionally arise
between the leaf and th
thorn. The thorns appear
to be tardily deciduous.

1. Hypholoma fasciculare
in a stump of Pinus
laricio, Col de la Coche.

2. Clitocybe infundibuliformis
A small group on litter
under Pinus laricio.

[TABLE] The forest on both sides
of the Col de la Coche
(between St Baldoph and
Chan[????]) is very similar 
a low garrigue of

[6792-6793]

Quercus pubescens,
with :
Buxus
Sorbus aria
Juniperus
Cornus sang.
Cistus * Helianthenum canum
Petroselinum ? * Peucedanum
                 austriacum
Ornithopus ? * Coronilla minima
Oronis (yellow)
Laserpitium (large leaflets).

[TABLE] On the hill to the
S. of the Col de la Coche
is a forest of Pinus
Laricio (presumably
planted). At the top
(750 m) is Pinus syl-
vestris, perhaps natural.
The hill ends on the

w.side in a cliff
150ft high, stepped in
places with sangles, with
considerable overhangs
elsewhere. The forest
runs to within about
15ft off the cliff edge,
where the trees are 
dwarfed, lop-sided (as on
a sea-cliff) and in some
cases dead. The
cliff is bordered by open
vegetation with scattered
low bushes and open
ground cover with the
spp listed overleaf.

merlet whihc is covered
with patchy scrub.
September 15.

A largish
centipede with [DIAG] x2/3
very long legs
was found in
the house of Chambéry. Although
quick-moving, it was captured
without difficulty.
[TABLE] The forests of the interior
of the Chartreuse are very
fine, composed mainly of
beech and Abies, both of
which are single-trunked
and remarkably tall. They
have been managed by the
Carthusians for centuries
[TABLE] Heracleum, mantegazzia-
numis abundant on the
Col du Granier.
September 16.
[TABLE] A large lemon yellow

[6802-6803]

and black butterfly 
span 3 1/2'',
with patches
of blue 
and orange
on the under-
side, was found dead
at Montfort, St Sulpice.

[TABLE] The woods at 980-1000m.
around the Col de l'Epine
are principally Abies, which 
occurs in almost, pure
stands in some place and
in others with an admixture
of Picea or Fagues. This
applies only to the -+
flat plateau on the top of
the mountain.
[TABLE] The steep E. facing slope

below the Col and in
the direction of Les Tonys is
very different. Conifers very
scarce. Beech and Tilia
platyphyllos predominant.
Corylus abundant, managed
as an understorey coppice
replaced by Castanea at
lower attitudes. The forest
N. of St Sulpice is mostly
high, the soils being deeper
than in the Enchanted
Forest. Quercus pubescens
is scarce, but occurs up
to c.950 m. Understorey
herbs genereally poor, but
where light penetrates (as
in the damp hollow of 
the faux Col de l'Epine),
there is a tall vegetation

[6804-6805]

containing :
Anuncus
Senecio fuchsii
Prenanthes
Gentiana lutea
[TABLE] Euonymus latifolius
in scarce ; it is not clear
why as this sp. has a
wide amplitude both of
light and water requirements.
[TABLE] Primula elatior is abun-
dant in these woods. This
is a general woodland
species with a wide range
of water requirements,
being abundant both
on the deep soils of the
Jura and the thin lime-
stone rendzina of the
N.W side of Mont St-Michel

[TABLE] There is a deep deposit
of fine loess-like material
about 1 km N.W. of St-Sulpice
church, but it is not clear
how general this is in the 
Jura. There is little bare
rock (apart from cliffs) in the
section visited today, the
main exception being an
area of steep limestone pave-
ment about 200m. N.W. of
Les Tonys.

encountered on several
previous occasions.

[TABLE] In the late evening, there
was a spectacular thunder-
storm. Summer lightning
was seen about 7 p.m. and

[6810-6811]
rapidilly increased. At 
8 p.m. thunder was 
heard. By 8.40 these
was very intense rain 
with loud thunder and
bright lightning, which
continued almost con-
tinuously (through never 
very close) until about
11 p.m.

September 17.
[TABLE] Boletus edulis was
seen on sale fresh in
a shop. Large specimens
sold at 700 f. the kilo,
medium-sized one at
1300f. The difference ap-
peared  to be one of size
and perhaps of age ; both
grades would probably be

wormy.

[TABLE] On the Côte de Chamoux,
Bissy, there is a certain amount
of Callune in open
heathy places on the summit.
[TABLE] On the same hill,
there are numerous large
Castenea trees among the
coppice. Many of
these are dying from the
tops, with regrowth from the
base and main limbs.

[6814-6815]

One such stag-headed tree
was found surrounded
by 5-6 others (standards and
coppice) all showing 
signs of crown disease.
September 20.
[TABLE] The woods between
Bourdeau, Charpignat,
and the Molard Noir
(350-885 m.) are variable
according to the depth
of soil. Three types
were seen.
1 : Quercus pubescens - Cor-
mus - Colutea scrub, rich in
Juniperus. On scree,
mainly at lower attitudes.
2 : Beech - hornbeam -
coppice .
3 : High forest of abies

and beech, with Abies
(as usual) regenerating
more freely, hazel under
storey, on the better soils
mainly at higher attitudes.
Herbs frequently subalpine.

1. Amanita phalloïdes. Locally
abundant in type 2.

2. A. citrina. Occasional in
type 3.

3. Phlegmacius sp. (pp

Croix de Nivolet down
to (and beyond) the Pas-
sage de l'Echelle de Fer.
The beeches have many
small cooked trunks,
but do not appear to
have been artificially cop-
piced. Sycomore is re-
markably similar in habit
and bark. No conifers.
No sign of fruiting of
beech, nor any regeneration
even in clearings.
[TABLE] The small area of
grassland at the Croix de
Nivolet is apparently natu-

This vegetation covers 
a considerable area of the
Alpette (the Granier proper
being mainly grass). The
substratum is pure white
limestone fissured with
crevasses (generally in
straight lines) of varying
width and not usually 
more than 6ft apart.
About 30% of the area 
carries vegetation, the
rest being bare. The trees
are curiously park-like.
Most of the under vegetation
growis in islands with some
accumulation of litter, but
some plants (including Rhodo-
dendron) grow almost directly
on the limestone. PHOTO.

a fine large many-trun-
ked one isolated near
the Porte de l'Alpette,
1500 m.
[TABLE] Carlina acaulis is
rather abundant on the
grassy Granier, the stem
being about 2 in. long.
[TABLE] Lichens are not very
abundant on the
Granier-Alpette. The chief
rock sp. (267) is abun-
dant on exposed rocks.
The pines are hung
with Evernia (268) and 
less commonly Usnea
(269), but although
abundant these are
usually small and
sometimes dead or dying.

[TABLE] The Alpe is a wide
stretch of Festuca grass-
land, similar to that
of the Granier but poorer
in species. It is grazed
by cattle. Water exists
in certain dolines where
there is nitrophilious
vegetation.
[TABLE] The forest between 
La Plagne and Col de
l'Alpette are small to medium
beech and Abies, kept in
management.
[TABLE] The great forest be-
tween Porte de l'Alpette and
Bellecombe is mainly
Abies, beech being domin-
ant at 1300-1500 m.
but otherwise rare. This

[6838-6839]

is probably the result 
of management. Abies
trees probably exceed
120ft at the optimum
(1100 m.) and 2ft diam.
rather closely spaced ; 
many dead trees althought
the forest has few other
Urwald features. Ground 
flora poor.
[TABLE] The beech zone has
a rich ground flora.
Soil scree or rock.
[TABLE] The forest at the
back of the Rochers de l'Al-
pe is Abies and pine.
It has recently been
drastically thinned.
[TABLE] The woods between
Bellecombe and Chapareil-

lan are the usual mixed
mainly deciduous type,
mesophytic  (though with 
some Q. pubescens)
and tanged with abun-
dant lianes (including
climbing and hanging
Rubus of Corrylifolli).

2. Phlegmacium (p.6794-6)
Occasional in the Cernon
valley.

3. Hebeloma (p.6807-9).
Small troops under Abies,
Cernon valley.

4. Lactarius deliciosus.
[TABLE] Frequent in the Cernon
valley. Milk orange.

5. Tremella mesenterica.
[TABLE] Once on fallen ha[????]el
between Bellecombe and
Chapareillan.

Nivollet (Sept. 21) cont.
Arctostaphylos.
[TABLE] Abundant and some-
times forming small puse
stands on limestone
ledges around the Nivolet
and Pas de l'Echelle de
Fer ; on limestone rocks
at c. 1,[!!!!][!!!!]000 m. near the Ferme
du Nivolet.

[TABLE] The exposed limestone
rocks around the
edge of the Nivolet
plateau have an un-

usually complete lichen
cover with many spp.
272-7, are from the Aiguille
de l'Echelle de Fer, 1,450 m.,
about 600 m. . of the
Nivolet. These rocks 
also contain an endo-
lithic alga (278) which
lines hair cracks in
the [SYMBOL] translucent stone up to
about 5 mm from the
surface.

4. Colocera viscosa.
[TABLE] Abies stump in woods.
