1. Amanita rubescens. One 
in the forest near Les Michetons,
St Sulpice.
2. Boletus edulis. One 
measuring 8''x 6''x 3 1/2'',
Les Michetons.

3. Inocybe geophylla lilacina.
Occasional in the "Enchanted 
forest" on the path to 
the Col St Michel, after
the Col du Crucifix branch.

4. Lepista nuda. A few
in the Enchanted Forest.

5. Many in a small groups
in the Enchanted Forest.

[6786-6787]

2-2-1/4. On mixed oak
and Abies litter. Not rooting.
[TABLE] P. convex-umbunate,
dull grayish azure (like
washed-out specimens of
strophania aeruginosa), faintly
fribrillose, dey.
[TABLE] S. slightly dilated below,
dirty cream, tinged bluish,
slightly fibrillose, solid,
flushy, naked, white-
-mycelial at base.
[TABLE] L. adnate-sinuate,
pale pinkish ochre, thin,
+- crowded, prominent,
marginal cystidia. Spp
probably white, but could
be pink or pale ochre.
[TABLE] C.thickish, white smell
mealy when cut ; the

whole fungus [DIAG]
however 
has a strong smell
of aniseed.
[TABLE] The wood on both 
sides of the Jura are
very similar floristically,
the differences in aspect 
bring perhaps compensated 
by the difference in soil.
The Aiguebelette side has
deeper soil on a less
abrupt slop. Beech and
hazel are dominant as

[6788-6789]

a managed coppice on
this side, but other spp
are abundant. Ivy is
an abundant ground herb.

[TABLE] The following fungi
were seen on sale in a shop
in Chambéry :
Boletus edulis (fresh)
[TABLE] 1500 F. le kilo
Boletus edulis } 
Gyromitra esculenta (dried)
                    in packets
September 12.
[TABLE] There is a nest of
hornets about 20ft above
ground in a walnut tree
at Myans, in a small 
cavity in the trunks Altho'
only about 20ft from a

house, it does not seem to
be much of a nuisance.
[TABLE] Rabbits are said to be
abundant in the Abymes
de Myans, partly as a 
result of deliberate intro-
duction in nearby preserves.
September 13.
[TABLE] Near upper Barberaz is 
a hedge of leguminous
tree with bipinnate leaves
in the arils of which (actu-
ally a little above) are
[!!!!][!!!!] short shoots modified
as tremendous thorns
(some over 3 in.long), ending
in a sharp point and often
with up to 4 branches.
[TABLE] The first formed few
leaves on this seasons

[6790-6791]

[DIAG]
growth are simply pin-
nate. Occasionally there is
an intermediate leaf which
is pinnate below, bippinate
above. The production of
thorns stops abruptly 
about halfway. up the
shoot, and the last formed

leaves have only minute
points in their axils.
Long shoots occasionally arise
between the leaf and th
thorn. The thorns appear
to be tardily deciduous.

1. Hypholoma fasciculare
in a stump of Pinus
laricio, Col de la Coche.

2. Clitocybe infundibuliformis
A small group on litter
under Pinus laricio.

[TABLE] The forest on both sides
of the Col de la Coche
(between St Baldoph and
Chan[????]) is very similar 
a low garrigue of

[6792-6793]

Quercus pubescens,
with :
Buxus
Sorbus aria
Juniperus
Cornus sang.
Cistus * Helianthenum canum
Petroselinum ? * Peucedanum
                 austriacum
Ornithopus ? * Coronilla minima
Oronis (yellow)
Laserpitium (large leaflets).

[TABLE] On the hill to the
S. of the Col de la Coche
is a forest of Pinus
Laricio (presumably
planted). At the top
(750 m) is Pinus syl-
vestris, perhaps natural.
The hill ends on the

w.side in a cliff
150ft high, stepped in
places with sangles, with
considerable overhangs
elsewhere. The forest
runs to within about
15ft off the cliff edge,
where the trees are 
dwarfed, lop-sided (as on
a sea-cliff) and in some
cases dead. The
cliff is bordered by open
vegetation with scattered
low bushes and open
ground cover with the
spp listed overleaf.
