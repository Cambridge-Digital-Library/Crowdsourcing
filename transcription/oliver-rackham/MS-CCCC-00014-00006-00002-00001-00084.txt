[TABLE] The wood on both

very similar floristically,
the differences in aspect 
bring perhaps compensated 
by the difference in soil.

deeper soil on a less
abrupt slop. Beech and
hazel are dominant as

[6788-6789]

a managed coppice on
this side, but other spp
are abundant. Ivy is
an abundant ground herb.

be much of a nuisance.
[TABLE] Rabbits are said to be
abundant in the Abymes

result of deliberate intro-
duction in nearby preserves.
