Bourn Wood
cont.
Middle Wood cont.
The nettles do not suggest
intensive phosphatization.
This is a 14th-17th cent.
wood on old arable. It appears
to have originated in one
piece rather than by encroach-
ment. The area cleared to the
N.W. was more like the old
wood in structure and thus
[????] determinate in age. That
cleared to the N. is known from
the O.S. [!!!!]1st [????][!!!!] to be post-
-1887.
Northern Belt.
4 long-established elm belt
[10334-10335]

with some sycamore and blue-
bells.
To the E. is a late 19th cent.
plantation in a highly phospha-
tized field headland. This is
known not to be earlier from
the 1 in 1st ed. confirmed by
the absence of woodland struc-
ture. Completely invaded by mercury.
Handle.
The Handle appears to be part
of the same former field as the
middle wood. Very similar in
woodland structure (elm with
ash stools [????]) and ground flora
(mercury-bluebell mosaic).
No damage to oxlips was

seen either in Bourn or Long-
stowe Woods.
Longstowe Wood produces
larger and taller oaks and
elms than anywhere in Bourne
or anywhere except the best-
-drained areas of Hayley.

April 6. (from p. 202).
Sheffield Botanical Garden
is hardly distinguishable from
any other well-kept public park.
It contains an aquarium in the
old Decimus Burton palm
houses. This has many exotic
fish in tanks. One tank con-
tains a number of small
terrapins. These swim slowly and
gracefully and crawl about
on the bottom. From time to
time they breathe by exposing
a very small part of the head.
They appear to ignore one
another's presence and the
big ones casually push the
little ones aside. When breath-
ing they can hold themselves
nearly upright in the water.

This species has an angular
head with a point in front.
The gritstone gorge of Der-
wentdale near Belper contains
steep hanging woods much like
those on the limestone but with
more mature trees.
In the Melton Mowbray
area, there is much R.[????]F. in
permanent grassland. They
tend to run up and down hill
but exceptions are frequent.
Wyfordby near Melton Mow-
bray appears to be a reduced
village, with an isolated church
and earthworks.
The Mountsorrel granite
outcrop near Loughboro' appears
as an undistinguished [????] hill.

April 9 (from p. 214).
The rough deal boards of
the home-made plant tubs
show no sign of decay after
two years. They were soaked in
Cuprinol before starting and
are being done again now.
April 10. (from p. 214).
The duck has been seen
in the New Court again.
April 21. (from p.277).
The last of the coppicing
in Hayley was finished.
Nailing thorn bushes over
the Hayley ash stools was
begun and rather less than
half completed.
One of the hard stakes of
the deer-fenced plot has
put forth leaves.
