Bourn Wood
cont.
Middle Wood cont.
The nettles do not suggest
intensive phosphatization.
This is a 14th-17th cent.
wood on old arable. It appears
to have originated in one
piece rather than by encroach-
ment. The area cleared to the
N.W. was more like the old
wood in structure and thus
less determinate in age. That
cleared to the N. is known from
the O.S. [!!!!]1st Ed.[!!!!] to be post-
-1887.
Northern Belt.
4 long-established elm belt
[10334-10335]
334
with some sycamore and blue-
bells.
To the E. is a late 19th cent.
plantation in a highly phospha-
tized field headland. This is
known not to be earlier from
the 1 in 1st ed. confirmed by
the absence of woodland struc-
ture. Completely invaded by mercury.
Handle.
The Handle appears to be part
of the same former field as the
middle wood. Very similar in
woodland structure (elm with
ash stools [????]) and ground flora
(mercury-bluebell mosaic).
No damage to oxlips was
335
[DIAG]
[10336-10337]
336
seen either in Bourn or Long-
stowe Woods.
Longstowe Wood produces
larger and taller oaks and
elms than anywhere in Bourne
or anywhere except the best-
-drained areas of Hayley.
337
April 6. (from p. 202).
Sheffield Botanical Garden
is hardly distinguishable from
any other well-kept public park.
It contains an aquarium in the
old Decimus Burton palm
houses. This has many exotic
fish in tanks. One tank con-
tains a number of small
terrapins. These swim slowly and
gracefully and crawl about
on the bottom. From time to
time they breathe by exposing
a very small part of the head.
They appear to ignore one
another's presence and the
big ones casually push the
little ones aside. When breath-
ing they can hold themselves
nearly upright in the water.
[10338-10339]
338
This species has an angular
head with a point in front.
The gritstone gorge of Der-
wentdale near Belper contains
steep hanging woods much like
those on the limestone but with
more mature trees.
In the Melton Mowbray
area, there is much R.[????]F. in
permanent grassland. They
tend to run up and down hill
but exceptions are frequent.
Wyfordby near Melton Mow-
bray appears to be a reduced
village, with an isolated church
and earthworks.
The Mountsorrel granite
outcrop near Loughboro' appears
as an undistinguished [????] hill.
339
April 9 (from p. 214).
The rough deal boards of
the home-made plant tubs
show no sign of decay after
two years. They were soaked in
Cuprinol before starting and
are being done again now.
April 10. (from p. 214).
The duck has been seen
in the New Court again.
April 21. (from p.277).
The last of the coppicing
in Hayley was finished.
Nailing thorn bushes over
the Hayley ash stools was
begun and rather less than
half completed.
One of the hard stakes of
the deer-fenced plot has
put forth leaves.
[10340-10341]
340
An extremely hot and
sticky daywith temperatures
over 70°F.
April 23 (from p. 278).
In addition to the hybrid
cowslips, Leckhampton has a
very small number (c.4) of
primrose-cowslip hybrids (some
tinged with pink) in grass
scattered about halfway down
the garden.
April 25 (from p. 306).
A large Onopordon (one of
several growing on the Leckhamp-
ton rubbish-heap) was dug up
and planted in a tub.
April 26 (from p. 306).
This has continued to be a
hot dry spell. The polythene bag
was removed from the Aristolochia
341
which has started growth. The
Passifloras remain dormant.
April 29.
Aruncus leaves are now
unfolding, very red at first.
April 30.
The Devil's Frying-pan
Violet, which dropped its
leaves immediately on being
planted, has now produced
a new leaf.
May 1.
West Huntingdonshire Woods.
The shores of Grafham
Water appear to be always at
more or less the same level. No
aquatics seen (at S.E. corner).
The dam has a large sea wall
on top with a vertically convex
curve to deflect waves.

A holly tree was seen with
both fruit and flowers at Hunting-
don.
Firing on Wed.
Sat. Sun.
Brampton Wood
Not entered (rifle firing today).
Almost certainly 3-storeyed.
Hawthorn scrub well developed
on S. side.
Oak standards scattered in S.
part, continuous in E. part
The hedge along the [????] S.
of the wood contains primroses,
mercury, and Euphorbia
amygdaloides (the last c.100
yards W. of the railway
bridge). Bluebells and Ranunculus
auricomus, Euphorbia c. 300
inf[????]s. This appears to have
[10344-10345]
344
been a double hedge with
a ditch between, felled fairly recently
Diddington Moat 1746[????]2.
[DIAG]
Planted with l[????]ih[????]eh[????]
c. 2 years ago
Cowslips
Spinney of small scrub oaks
- larger ones felled.
Few ashes incl. one stool tree.
Hawthorn mono. & hybrids

Primrose rare
345
Nettle dom.
Solanum Dulcamara ab. in
wetter part of ditch.
Diddington Wood (not entered)
Oak and ash st[????]ards large
and dense forming a closed
canopy.
Large coppice probably exists
but certainly sparse
Abundant small coppice and
s[????].
Viburnum lantana.
Wood - bank along parish
boundary.
Mercury in adjoining road
ditch. This is a new road but
the mercury almost certainly came
from the (now largely disappeared)
hedges running W. from Diddington
Wood.
[10346-10347]
346
Pe[????]y East Wood.
[DIAG]
Very wide main ride with prim-
roses & cowslips - no obvious
hybrids.
Standards 2/3 oak 1/3 ash (of
coppice origin).
Oak to 2'6 dia: stumps
doubtful. Several of stump origin
near W. corner.
Ash to 1'6 dia, mainly coppice
origin.
Elm area elms ca[????]
scattered among oaks & not
347
overtopping: largest c.1'6",
poles few, s[????]s few. [????] large
coppice under: s.c. mainly elm.
Large coppice: ash c.3ft x 1ft,
Maple less freq. Not closed
canopy. Poles to c. 6m.
Small coppice: mainly hazel,
poles c . 2 in., cut c. 15 years?
Crataegus: mainly oxy.
Viburnum Op.
   "  lant.
Clematis vitalba by road
Euonymmus freq. by road
Ivy only on ground at
roadside
Salix atrocin,
Privet
[10348-10349]

Ground flora: near road PB
with scattered M. W. of ride B.
Poplar: occ. poles c. 4 in.
Cardamine pratensis on road-
side verge.
West corner logged to make
way for power lines.
Mercury & Bluebell dom.
Euphorbia amygdaloides
exceedingly abundant & flowering.
Oak 2ft 6" 205 ± 2 years
very little increment in last 15.
Chickweed *    Möhringia trinervia -
Barbarea vulg.   mainly 4-me[????]s.
Scrophularia
349
Ash: maple c.1:4 here
one 4'4"X12"
Some stools very elliptical.
39 rings on pole - still growing.
New growth 1 year old,
3 fasciated shorts on one pole.
[DIAG]
Maple stools all smaller
Probably a dry wood despite its
flat situation.
Probably an ancient wood, its
rectilinear shape resulting from
recent or medieval assorts.
Structure, large stools, mercury,
&c. suggest this.
