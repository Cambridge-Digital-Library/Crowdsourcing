Bourn Wood
cont.
Middle Wood cont.
The nettles do not suggest
intensive phosphatization.
This is a 14th-17th cent.
wood on old arable. It appears
to have originated in one
piece rather than by encroach-
ment. The area cleared to the
N.W. was more like the old
wood in structure and thus
less determinate in age. That
cleared to the N. is known from
the O.S. [!!!!]1st Ed.[!!!!] to be post-
-1887.
Northern Belt.
4 long-established elm belt
[10334-10335]
334
with some sycamore and blue-
bells.
To the E. is a late 19th cent.
plantation in a highly phospha-
tized field headland. This is
known not to be earlier from
the 1 in 1st ed. confirmed by
the absence of woodland struc-
ture. Completely invaded by mercury.
Handle.
The Handle appears to be part
of the same former field as the
middle wood. Very similar in
woodland structure (elm with
ash stools [????]) and ground flora
(mercury-bluebell mosaic).
No damage to oxlips was
335
[DIAG]
[10336-10337]

seen either in Bourn or Long-
stowe Woods.
Longstowe Wood produces
larger and taller oaks and
elms than anywhere in Bourne
or anywhere except the best-
-drained areas of Hayley.

April 6. (from p. 202).
Sheffield Botanical Garden
is hardly distinguishable from
any other well-kept public park.
It contains an aquarium in the
old Decimus Burton palm
houses. This has many exotic
fish in tanks. One tank con-
tains a number of small
terrapins. These swim slowly and
gracefully and crawl about
on the bottom. From time to
time they breathe by exposing
a very small part of the head.
They appear to ignore one
another's presence and the
big ones casually push the
little ones aside. When breath-
ing they can hold themselves
nearly upright in the water.
[10338-10339]
338
This species has an angular
head with a point in front.
The gritstone gorge of Der-
wentdale near Belper contains
steep hanging woods much like
those on the limestone but with
more mature trees.
In the Melton Mowbray
area, there is much R.[????]F. in
permanent grassland. They
tend to run up and down hill
but exceptions are frequent.
Wyfordby near Melton Mow-
bray appears to be a reduced
village, with an isolated church
and earthworks.
The Mountsorrel granite
outcrop near Loughboro' appears
as an undistinguished [????] hill.
339
April 9 (from p. 214).
The rough deal boards of
the home-made plant tubs
show no sign of decay after
two years. They were soaked in
Cuprinol before starting and
are being done again now.
April 10. (from p. 214).
The duck has been seen
in the New Court again.
April 21. (from p.277).
The last of the coppicing
in Hayley was finished.
Nailing thorn bushes over
the Hayley ash stools was
begun and rather less than
half completed.
One of the hard stakes of
the deer-fenced plot has
put forth leaves.
[10340-10341]
340
An extremely hot and
sticky daywith temperatures
over 70°F.
April 23 (from p. 278).
In addition to the hybrid
cowslips, Leckhampton has a
very small number (c.4) of
primrose-cowslip hybrids (some
tinged with pink) in grass
scattered about halfway down
the garden.
April 25 (from p. 306).
A large Onopordon (one of
several growing on the Leckhamp-
ton rubbish-heap) was dug up
and planted in a tub.
April 26 (from p. 306).
This has continued to be a
hot dry spell. The polythene bag
was removed from the Aristolochia
341
which has started growth. The
Passifloras remain dormant.
April 29.
Aruncus leaves are now
unfolding, very red at first.
April 30.
The Devil's Frying-pan
Violet, which dropped its
leaves immediately on being
planted, has now produced
a new leaf.
May 1.
West Huntingdonshire Woods.
The shores of Grafham
Water appear to be always at
more or less the same level. No
aquatics seen (at S.E. corner).
The dam has a large sea wall
on top with a vertically convex
curve to deflect waves.

A remarkable contrast with
Perry Wood and Perry Ash Wood.
Small coppice is rare and
atypical (Small ash stools, U.
gl. stools) and largely replaced
by poles. The roadside hedge
is further evidence that the
wood in the W. part which was
not visited.
The S.E. corner is a

mainly of ash poles. Stools
absent although they occur in
a similar situation at Monks'

359
Although lacking good
large ash stools, this wood
may be ancient as it is
on a very good hill-top
site. Field boundaries suggest
that it may be the N. half
of a nearly circular hill-top
wood. The course of the
road to the N. seems to be deter-
mined by the wood, leaving
two acute field corners which
have become overgrown.
Coppicing is a remarkable
survival. Not much of the
wood seems to have been cut recently.

This wood is difficult to assess
because the complex banks on
the S.W. side make it difficult
to see the interior. There ap-
pears to be little justification
for the "scrub" areas on the
2 1/2" map, where there has been
some half-hearted conifer
planting.
The wood is of the Perry
rather than the Perry W. type
and is probably ancient.
The S. hedge probably repre-
sents a fragment of wood left
behind in the assart.
365
Alexanders is common in
hedges at Yelling.
The hawthorn at Little Paxton
Wood is mainly mono. but was
seen only on the complex W.
bank so may not be typical.
St Neots Islands Common is
semi-improved grassland like
Sheep's Green.
Toseland has a small tower-
less church which though
mainly Victorian Norman has a
fine genuine Norman [!!!!]porch[!!!!] doorway and
chancel arch. The loke-like
field to the W. of the church (which
does not stand on any road or
path) contains several low
mounds suggesting a deserted
street. The houses except the Hall
appear not to be ancient.

War Ditches and for several
hundred yards to the S.
Coploe Hill Lynchets.
The top 2 linchets, which are
wider, have been cultivated
this year. The bottom 2 and
the linchet banks are over-
grown with hawthorn scrub
now about 10ft high.
At the foot is a wide
369
[DIAG]
strip-field and then a narrow
strip-field between this and the
bottom of the valley.
The pit at Coploe Hill con-
tains [!!!!]th[!!!!] some areas of good
chalk grassland with patches
of scrub and glades in the
scrub. There does not seem to
have been any recent scrub
encroachment.

Hayley Wood. Master & Fellows of
C.C.C.C.
The two crab trees in the
1967 plot are not about the
middle of flowering. Both are
magnificent, like garden trees.
Other crabs in the wood flower
more sparsely and only near
the top of the tree. [SYMBOL].
Sun scald is severe on a
few ash trees in the 1967 plot
and at the sides of the Glade.
Only coppice poles are affected.
A broad strip of bark, about
6in. wide and over 10ft long,
on the W. side has died. The
trees appear quite healthy
and the wounds are starting
to close.
Bluebells are now just
before mid-flowering and oxlips
371
well past.
Near the pond about
12 plants of Paris were seen,
one (4-me[????]) flowering.
No recent deer activity, but
stale footprints near the pond.
Ajuga is begining to flower.
The whole wood is very
soft after recent rains despite
the drought of late March and
early April. There is much
surface water particularly in
the N. and E. sections but also
in the S. & W. There is con-
siderable
run-off along
Hayley Ditch, in the S. section,
and along the N.E. ditch of
the pond ride.
The pond is very full
[10372-10373]
372
and the fallen tree almost
submerged. The moorhen has
nested as usual and the
nest is touching the water.
Bluebells are flourishing in
the Glade.
Hypholome fasciculare.
Several scattered sporophores
in Hayley Lane.
Crataegus oxyacanthoides
is just beginning to flower but
C. monogyna has weeks to
go.
Young leaves of Ulmus glabra
are not easily distinguishable
from carpinifolia. They are
more rectangular in shape and
appear a few days earlier.
373
About a quarter of the
cowslips in Leckhampton show
some introgression with the
dark cowslips. A few scattered
plants show introgression with
the primrose or some similar
Primula.
Cowslip flowers have a
pleasant saffron-like flavour.

All the Hayley Glade has
been mown, although some
of the old bonfire sites are
not yet cleared. The mowing
was too early to affect mer-
cury. The oxlips have increased
this year in the Glade, who'
not to the same extent as
last year.
May 2 (from p.366).
The Japanese cherries are
very fine this year, especially
Shiro-fugen and Shimosu-sa-

May 4 (cont. from p. 369).
Shepreth L-Moor.
Only the part N.W. of
the railway was visited. It
communicates with the S.E.
part by a tunnel.
[DIAG]
The Moor is intersected
by a number of shallow
[10376-10377]
376
ditches (general orientation
as shown). The flat areas
vary considerably in level.
Rough grassland with
Juncus. Turf contains much
Dactylis. Cowslips abundant
(and much picked), scattered
over the whole area but mainly
on the higher parts.
The Moor is remarkable
for the numerous anthills up
to c.2ft high. Their flora
varies considerably from one
to another. Thymus occurs
on some.
Hawthorn bushes are
frequent and all large. There
is not as yet much difference
in this respect between the
grazed and ungrazed areas.
377
A grasshopper-warbler was
heard in the bushes in the
ungrazed part.
There has not been any
grazing yet this year.
May 6.
The ducks in the New
Court hatched today.
May 7.
The duck continued to sit

May 11.
Buff Wood (Naturalists' Trust).
Myosotis arvensis grows in
bushes just at the edge of the

Primula elatior and its
hybrids are fairly dense in the
northern oxlip area.
The bluebells are about at
the height of flowering. Oxlips
are well past the best, and
379
[DIAG]
[10380-10381]

primroses not quite so advanced
as oxlips.
Orchis mascula does very
well in the Wood, notably a
patch of 60-65 flowering spikes
within c. 3 yards near the
top of the Back Lane.
Iris does well in an open
part of the wood a few yards from
the pond-like area in the N. section.
The coppicing was finished
this week in the hornbeam area.
Hornbeam stools bleed very copiously.
Several hornbeams have been left
for promotion.
Much of the S. moat has no
coppice at all.
The wood is now much wetter
on the surface after rains. The
standing water on the S.E. ride
381
is particularly formidable.
By the N. end of the "back
lane" is a lrge patch of mercury
with a patchy mosaic-like leaf
discolouration. Leaves slightly crinkled
and plant slightly stunted. Sur-
rounded by "normal" mercury.
The Iris mentioned has leaves
striped with narrow pale stripes.
The Daphne near the pond
is fruiting well.
Crab trees (even when well
exposed to light) flower poorly.
In the handle is a fine
small-coppice crab with several
trunks.
A number of cold-front
showers with thunder.
It is doubtful whether
the ridge-and-furrow in the
[10382-10383]
382
"Lane" has any genuine cop-
pice.
May 12.
Cercis is flowering well at
Coton.
Cold-front weather with a
fine rainbow: double with
2 inner fringes.
Cercis buds have a sweet
taste recalling fruits of Vaccin-
ium uliginosum.

particularly around the edge of
bonfire sites.
Galeobdolon does very well
in the 1967 plot.
7 flowering plants of Paris
near the [????]ide.
1 white bluebell near New
Ride.
The following areas have
been mown this year:
1. Main Ride.
2. Pond Ride and S.W. enlarge-
ment, except for a length on
either side of the pond.
3. 1st North Ride (whole length
straight).
4. Pond Glade (done yesterday).
5. Cross-roads Glade (except for
[10384-10385]
384
the other S. sector).
6. Main Glade (some parts
twice).
Rubus caesius is going
to be a nuisance in Main Glade;
stems are now about 1ft long.
A rack was cut through the
coppice plots parallel to Main Ride,
with some damage to Sedum Te-
lephium.
Oxlips are fruiting in the
deer-fenced enclosure.
After heavy rain there is
much surface stagnant water
and the whole of the rides
and other parts of the ground
surface are very sticky. The
pond is high.
The moorhen's nest in the
pond (in the top of a submer-
385
ged tree) is nearly awash. It
contains four eggs.
