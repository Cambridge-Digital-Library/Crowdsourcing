Cotoneaster tomentosa is
locally abundant in the
Rosengarden Schlucht
Arctistaphylos uva ursi
also occurs there.
The rocky and gravelly
ground between Rosengardl-
Schlucht and [????]Gung gnïn[????]
comes a light forest of
small pine trees, to about
30 ft high, with very diverse
habits. The vegetation is 
markedly dry. The ground
cover in mainly Erica
carnea. Pinus mugo is 
local. Dorychnium and
Teucrium chamaedrys are
abundant.
Allium carinatum occurs
in this wood. The stamens

[4774-4775]
4774
are of different lengths in
the same fl: the longest
one is usually about twice
as long as the per. segs
and the shortest somewhat
shorter than the per. segs.
Peucedanum verticillare
is a very impressive plant.
It stands about 6ft high,
and consits entirely of 
infl. Branches of the
first order arranged in 
whorls; each bears a terminal umbel and two
opposite second-order bran-
ches which bear 1 - 2
umbels each.
A Calamagrostis conform-
ing to C. varia is very
abundant in light shade

4775
in the Schlucht and
nearby woods.
Carex brachystachya
grows on gravel near the
gravel pit.
August 5.
Pinus mugo in Salfosen
Tal.
Forms great thickets
on rocky slopes on both
sides of the valley.
Photo on a slope of 30° - 40°.
Habit as in Lechtal: long
prostrate trunks, several
from a common base,
with ascending ends,
to 10 - 15 ft long. When
growing over the
edge of a cliff, the trunks hang down as

[4776-4777]
4776
on a slope. Frs not abundant. 
In Maldonalm are
nitrophilous meadows with
much senecio alpinus,
Veratnum, Aeonitum, de.
Much of the Veratnum 
is flowering.

1. Amanita muscaria. One
under pine near Linfer-
hof.
Metharia was not
found on the old
arches at the tree
line in Maldonalm.
In Salfeesental,
large cigar-shaped
degs are a nuisance.

4777
They are rather easily
[????]suited[????] but make a 
mess.
Most of the grass-
land in Maldonalm
and around Hahntenn-
joch, c. 1600 - 1900 m., is
a rather rich Nardetum
with large patches of
Rhododendron spp. Lacitschen
cover the screes on the
sides of the valley to
a height of about 2100
in. THere are small
birch woods. The ordinary
tree line is rather sharp
at c. 1800m.
Silene cucubalus
is a common pioneer of 
scree in Maldon.

[4778-4779]
4778
2. A few under spruce near
Linserhof. 2 - 2 3/4 - 1/2.
P. flat, dull orange,
darker in the centre, smooth,
matt, dry, not slimy, margin
plain.
S. cylindric, concolorous,
surface similar, brittle, hollow,
naked.
C. thinnish, cream,
new-meal smell.
L. thin, crowded, mostly
equal, a few forking near 
the base, slightly decurrent,
pale orange.
Lactanius mitissimus. [G&M]

Both spp of Rhododendron
occur around Hahntennjoch,
sometimes within a few

ft of each other, and
intermediate forms appear
to occur.
A short intensive collection
was made on a small
hillock which lies across
the valley just on the
Maldon 'side of the pass.
Most of the bushes ap-
pear to be Rh. ferrugineum
Rh. hirsutum grows
mainly on the sides of
the mound. A specimen
was taken from each
of 18 bushes. The accom-
panying flora includes:
Dryas
Rhus mugo
Salix reticulata
Vaccinium myrtillus

[4780-4781]
4780

Galium pumilium
Luzula alpinopilosa
Campanula barbata
Nardus stricta
Salix herbacea [refusa]
Festuca pulchella
Primula farinosa
Euphrasia minima
cf Rhytidiadelphus: 288
Cetraria: 289
Cladonia: 290
Dicranoid: 291
Campylopodoid: 292

For comparison,
65 specimens were
collected from different
clones (as far as "possible)
along the Maldon road
between Maldonalm gate

4781
and the bridge. Only
Rh. hursutum appeared
to be present.
A monstrous Tofieldia
was found in Salfeesental.
Infl. a raceme of stalked
capitula each of 3 - 6
sessile fls. per. segs poorly
developed.
August [!!!!]1[!!!!]6.
Several large frogs
were seen in the Gurgltal
marshes.
A slow worm was seen
on the road from Imst to
Nassereith which skirts Tschir-
gant.
A lizard was found
in grass nearby.
The woods of the 

[4782-4783]
4782
lower N.W. slopes of Tschir-
gant are mainly pine.
THere is a good proportion
of the larch and spruce. No
Letharia was found.
Flies of both the biting
spp are very abundant in 
the Gurgltal marshes. Bracken
appears to keep them away.

The following fungi were
collected in mixed coniferous
forest, mostly rather less
than mature, at the
base of Tschirgant on the
N.W. side, mainly near
the Saatschük just S. of 
Nassereith.

4783
abundant, mostly under
pine, in small gruops and
singly.

2. Calocera viscosa. A small 
dried-up tuft was found
among spruce roots.

3. Several, mainly singly,
under larch. 3 1/2 - 4 - 1/2.
P. convex, golden-yellow-
brown, smooth, very slimy,
margin plain.
S. cylindric, lemon
yellow with brownish
flecks, ringed about
3/4 way up with a small
thick ring, solid, fibrous.
P.S. slightly decur-
rent, golden brown.
