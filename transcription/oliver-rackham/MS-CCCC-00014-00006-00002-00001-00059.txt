Cotoneaster tomentosa is
locally abundant in the
Rosengarden Schlucht
Arctistaphylos uva ursi
also occurs there.
The rocky and gravelly
ground between Rosengardl-
Schlucht and [????]Gung gnïn[????]
comes a light forest of
small pine trees, to about
30 ft high, with very diverse
habits. The vegetation is 
markedly dry. The ground
cover in mainly Erica
carnea. Pinus mugo is 
local. Dorychnium and
Teucrium chamaedrys are
abundant.
Allium carinatum occurs
in this wood. The stamens

[4774-4775]
4774
are of different lengths in
the same fl: the longest
one is usually about twice
as long as the per. segs
and the shortest somewhat
shorter than the per. segs.
Peucedanum verticillare
is a very impressive plant.
It stands about 6ft high,
and consits entirely of 
infl. Branches of the
first order arranged in 
whorls; each bears a terminal umbel and two
opposite second-order bran-
ches which bear 1 - 2
umbels each.
A Calamagrostis conform-
ing to C. varia is very
abundant in light shade

4775
in the Schlucht and
nearby woods.
Carex brachystachya
grows on gravel near the
gravel pit.
August 5.
Pinus mugo in Salfosen
Tal.
Forms great thickets
on rocky slopes on both
sides of the valley.
Photo on a slope of 30° - 40°.
Habit as in Lechtal: long
prostrate trunks, several
from a common base,
with ascending ends,
to 10 - 15 ft long. When
growing over the
edge of a cliff, the trunks hang down as

[4776-4777]
4776
on a slope. Frs not abundant. 
In Maldonalm are
nitrophilous meadows with
much senecio alpinus,
Veratnum, Aeonitum, de.
Much of the Veratnum 
is flowering.

1. Amanita muscaria. One
under pine near Linfer-
hof.
Metharia was not
found on the old
arches at the tree
line in Maldonalm.
In Salfeesental,
large cigar-shaped
degs are a nuisance.

4777
They are rather easily
[????]suited[????] but make a 
mess.
Most of the grass-
land in Maldonalm
and around Hahntenn-
joch, c. 1600 - 1900 m., is
a rather rich Nardetum
with large patches of
Rhododendron spp. Lacitschen
cover the screes on the
sides of the valley to
a height of about 2100
in. THere are small
birch woods. The ordinary
tree line is rather sharp
at c. 1800m.
Silene cucubalus
is a common pioneer of 
scree in Maldon.

[4778-4779]
4778
2. A few under spruce near
Linserhof. 2 - 2 3/4 - 1/2.
P. flat, dull orange,
darker in the centre, smooth,
matt, dry, not slimy, margin
plain.
S. cylindric, concolorous,
surface similar, brittle, hollow,
naked.
C. thinnish, cream,
new-meal smell.
L. thin, crowded, mostly
equal, a few forking near 
the base, slightly decurrent,
pale orange.
Lactanius mitissimus. [G&M]

Both spp of Rhododendron
occur around Hahntennjoch,
sometimes within a few

ft of each other, and
intermediate forms appear
to occur.
A short intensive collection
was made on a small
hillock which lies across
the valley just on the
Maldon 'side of the pass.
Most of the bushes ap-
pear to be Rh. ferrugineum
Rh. hirsutum grows
mainly on the sides of
the mound. A specimen
was taken from each
of 18 bushes. The accom-
panying flora includes:
Dryas
Rhus mugo
Salix reticulata
Vaccinium myrtillus

[4780-4781]
4780

Galium pumilium
Luzula alpinopilosa
Campanula barbata
Nardus stricta
Salix herbacea [refusa]
Festuca pulchella
Primula farinosa
Euphrasia minima
cf Rhytidiadelphus: 288
Cetraria: 289
Cladonia: 290
Dicranoid: 291
Campylopodoid: 292

For comparison,
65 specimens were
collected from different
clones (as far as "possible)
along the Maldon road
between Maldonalm gate

4781
and the bridge. Only
Rh. hursutum appeared
to be present.
A monstrous Tofieldia
was found in Salfeesental.
Infl. a raceme of stalked
capitula each of 3 - 6
sessile fls. per. segs poorly
developed.
August [!!!!]1[!!!!]6.
Several large frogs
were seen in the Gurgltal
marshes.
A slow worm was seen
on the road from Imst to
Nassereith which skirts Tschir-
gant.
A lizard was found
in grass nearby.
The woods of the 

[4782-4783]
4782
lower N.W. slopes of Tschir-
gant are mainly pine.
THere is a good proportion
of the larch and spruce. No
Letharia was found.
Flies of both the biting
spp are very abundant in 
the Gurgltal marshes. Bracken
appears to keep them away.

The following fungi were
collected in mixed coniferous
forest, mostly rather less
than mature, at the
base of Tschirgant on the
N.W. side, mainly near
the Saatschük just S. of 
Nassereith.

4783

pine, in small gruops and

dant by the roadside

vegetation very similar
to that of similar sites
in Samnaun, though
some spp have not been

The woods on S. W.

flora:
Picea

Pinus sylvestris

Tilia cordata (much

Fraxinus
Castanea (only three
trees seen, outside the
wood proper and per-
haps planted, thriving
and with a good crop of
large frs. The tree is said
to be abundant and
probably native in the dis-
trict)
Populus tremula

1. Armillariella mellea.
Two small rufts of 
sporophores were found
by the Piburger see in 
spruce wood.
1. On a rotten spruce

4817
stump also attacked by
another fungus (of Fomes).
Considerable subcortical
mycelial sheet. White rhizo-
morphs many, black
present but scarce.
2. This tuft (and an
isolated sporophore) grew
in mossy ground. The 
only possible food bases
in the immediate vicinity
were some wood rotted
to a consistency scarcely
distinguishable from the
friable peaty soil, and
some rotten vaccinium
rhizomes. From the base
of each sporophire pro-
ceeded a fine sparsely
branching rhizomorph, with

[4818-4819]
4818
dark brown fragile cortex
and white elastic medulla.
Several other tufts
of sporophores were seen,
all on or very near old
stumps and old rotten
roots, on the S. shore of
the lake.

The flora of the
woods around the Pi-
burger see is generally
typically acid (vaccinium
spp, ptilium crista castrensis
dc) but includes a 
few calcreoles:
Erica carnea - abundant
on the Kewzel ridge.
Paris (V.R.)
Rhytidium rugosum (cf

A large basket-
-shaped witches' broom
was seen [DIAG]
near the top
of a spruce
tree near
the Pipurger

of many as-
cending branches, each
much branched with
densely lfy tips, forms
a hollow structure like
the crow's nest of a
sailing ship. The main
axis of the tree grows
through this nest, but

Well-developed trees
of J. sabina are up

with are prostrate trunk to 2"
diam. Branching some-
what complanate,

ance i.e. very irregular

dioecious: frs very

three types:
1. Short branching sys-
tems with adult lvs,
forming the great bulk
of all trees seen.
2. Leading branch
systems with interme-
diate lvs.
3. Innovations bearing

4825
juvenile lvs. Present on

then only in smal num-
bers. Either from the

Juniperus is dominant
on steep ledges with a slope
of about 60° - 80°. On less 
steep ledges, Calamagrostis
becomes dominant. On
vertical ledges, mosses are
dominant, thouh Juniperus
may hang over.
Juniperus communis
has been seen with J.
sabina, but is not abundant.
Innovations arise,
either adventitiously
or from the proliferation

[4826-4827]

of short shoots following
cutting off of a branch.
THey change into short
or long shoot systems
as the case may be.
Only two young plants
were found (possibly
suckers from old stocks).
One was much branched,
with all shoots of the 
innovation type with
juvenile lvs. The other
was somewhat larger,
with a tendency on some
shoots to the leading shoot
type.
At Langenfeld is
an ash tree through
the trunk of which 
comes the pipe of a

fountain. The latter is
completely enclosed by
the wood. It works well.
Pine predominates on
the dry cliffs of Bürgstein-
wände, but the forests
above and around are
mainly spruce and larch.
All parts of Juniperus
Sabina have an unpleasant
smell recalling lemon and
resin. The frs when chewed
have a similar nauseating 
taste.
Spp accompanying Juni-
perus Sabina elsewhere include:
Sedum dasyphyllum
S. annuum
Sempervivum arachnoideum
Minuartia laricifolia

Veronica fruticans
Allium senescens
Asplenium septentrionale
August 10.
Haus Nössing
Huben; Langenfeld
A considerable quan-
tity of loose smut occurs
on Hordeum distichon
at Huben.
Asplenium septentrio-
nale grows mainly in small
clefts of the rock in
N. and N. W. facing cliffs,
usually not near Juniperus
Sabina.
Juniperus sabina is
abundant on the E.
side of the Ache gorge
between Sölden and
Zweiselstein. In similar
situations to that
