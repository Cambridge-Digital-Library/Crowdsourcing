The heavily mistleto'd

Jan. 18.     SHADWELL WOOD.
The great elm at the N.W.
corner of Queens' Piece has
been cut down. It last put
forth green leaves about 12
years ago (the bark having
been eaten by horses) and 
was almost completely rotten
at ground level.

Branch stubs A were
cut off some years before the 
tree died. They perhaps
arise from pollarding or
fall of the tree-top; 80 
rings.
Another estimate of age at
base: 212 y. in outer 14 1/2 in.;
total radius 25".
Tree may originally have 
been pollarded at Height B;
if so it then developed one
main trunk which later broke,
or was felled, at c.

Epicormics alive.
(2) 215 [SYMBOL] 3 y. 3'6". 1-2 in of
non-wetwood. About 1/6 circum-
ference at base decorticated &

rotten surface.

These are two elms in the
avenue nearest [!!!!]Ganet [????][!!!!] college entrance.

Tree 2 was topped 7 y.
ago. Cut surface horizontal,
still relatively sound but
2 pockets of decay. Not
protected in any way.

The two dead trees were

procera, like most of the elms
in the N. - S. avenue along Trinity
Scholars' Piece.
