This is evidently the remains of
an oil-mill, in a small vslley 1 km
SSW of Mavrommati church. It
contains:
(1) A vertical, evidently hand-
screwed press, made in Greece.
(2) Steam-engine, made in Gran-
tham. Piston missing, one flywheel
broken.
(3) Grinding mill, of two mill-
stones working on a bed. The
plan shows this in relation to the
steam-engine.
(4) Boiler for steam-engine,
apparently of a primitive ver-
tical type.

PLAIN OF THISBE

GUF OF DOMVRENA
9795
   The hills between the
Plain of Thisbe and the sea
are in general very hesvily
grazed with numerous sheep-
folds.
   The Tsaria peninsula is
apparently less grazed, with
tall maquis covering about
60% of the surface. No visi-
ble buildings. Some of the is-
lands in the gulf appear to
be wholly maquis-covered, but
this varies from island to island.
  Vathy is a deep cliff-sided
inhospitable inlet.  

Plain of Thisbe.
   A basin, aplarently land-
locked, with nearly level
floor sloping slightly towards
[19796-19797]
9796
the SW, Allegedly a lake in
classical  times, divided in two
by a dyke which enabled half
of it to be cultivsted at one
time (Pausanias). The remains
of this dyke can clearly be seen
in the form of huge ashlar
blocks, sometimes 2-3 courses
high; at the S. end it forms
the base of the modern N-S
road across the basin, but
at the N end it diverges a
few ft to the W.  Tew bridge 
carrying the road across the
dried-up ceneal channel arch 
is a  asub-modern arch on
massive classical abutments.
   The plain has long been
divided into narrow strips of
farmland; it has no trace of
9797
water or aquatic vegetation.
The main crop is corn with
olives on the marginal slppes.
   In looking for a auitsble
place to tke a core, we
came upon a  very extensive set-
tlement site: pottery and tiles
of an extensive Classicasl period
thickly scattered over many
acres, down to the bottom of
the olive zone.
   No trace of peat or silt
found: the soil is a sandy
clay and is brick=-hard to
many feet deep. Cracks are
up to 3" across and at
least 2 ft deep. We damaged
the Hiller borer in trying to
take a core.
A commercial borehole in
[19798-19799]
9798
the basin revealed a series of
muds and clays, including
possible lake silts at great
depth.

   For the remains of anci-
ent Thisbe, see 18 Aug.
   A few drops of rain fell
at Thisbe.

Mavrommati Patronal Festival
   Held on the nights of 4,5,6
Aug.
   Little religious observance, tho'
the ikons were paraded around
the [????] and we were told
there was a procession to a near-
by monastery.
   Of the five [????] in
Mavrommati, three had bands
9799
consisting of a singer and three
instuments (e.g. electric guitar, 
fiddle (with micpohone
attached) and a small drum.
The works were mainly By-
zantine pop music of a very
repetitive kind, though attempts
were made at other genres
(e.g. Hava Naguila). This en-
tertained the many hundred
revellers who crowded into
Mavrommati for the occasion.
The noise was deafening;
the equipment was run at
full volume beyond the point
at which it amplified pro-
perly. Customers sat solemnly 
drinking within a few 
yards of the machinery,
apparently taking not the least
[19800-19801]
9800
notice: indeed, apart from a
few perfunctory attempts to dance
the syrta, the customers seemed
to ignore the musicians.
   Our own house had a little 
band consisting of an old and
elaborately inlaid bowzouki,
a large clarinet-like keyed instru-
ment and a drum.
   The various bands played
without any coordination. They
began at 8 p.m. and they
suddenly finished, in accor-
dance with a new licensibng
law, though talking snd revell-
ing continued until dawn.
The villagee slept the fol]owing
day.

Helleborus cyclophyllus.
A famous plant of Helicon from
ancient times. Abundant from
800 to 1450 m in woods and
screes. Most flourishing in open
habitats. No tace of flowers or
fruit.

Dianthus giganteus   ssp  cro
aticus appears to be the sp. freq.
quent on screes, 1100 - 1300 m.

Deciduous Oaks.
   Three species appear to be pre-
sent, with many hybrids which blur
the distinctions. See Aug. 12.
   The oaks are coppiced (see
Aug. 12); the stools are usually
rather indeterminste in size, being
underground, but do not often ex-
9809
ceed 5 ft. (-8 ft) Poles up to 20 ft
high and c. 2" thick, probsb;y
c. 20 years' growth.
   There seems to be no attempt
made to protect the oaks from 
grazing, but this is largely
confined to the grsassland r-
ther  than the woods. It delays
but does not prevent regrowth.
Possibly in Zones A and B the
grszing is limited to cattle,
whereas E and above, on more
difficult terrain are severely
grazed by goats.
The oaks are totally sterile,
diligent search failed to find
a single acorn (whence, in parts,
the difficulty of distinguishing 
the species).
   Deciduus oaks are almost
[19810-19811]
9810
certsinly dclining at both
altitudinal extremes, because
wirh rhe present regime of 
cutting and grazing they do
not fruit, Q. coccifera, in con-
trast, fruits freely. Withiin their
present range the oaks ap-
pear to be invaded by Abies,
which is rspidly spreading
at their expense.
   Juniperus oxycedous ia fre-
quent in the deciduous oak
zone. Surprisingly, it is more
set back by grazing than oak
or fir.
   Hawthorn (Crataegus penta-
gyna) frequently accompanies
the deciduous oak and ex-
tends into Zone E; it is 
grazed about as much as oak.
9811
   Zones C and D are on
very craggy terrsin, thickly
wooded, grazed by goats but
not very severely.
  Phillyrea papears to be
intermediate in grazing resist-
ance between deciduous and
evergreen oaks.
Spartium rare in Zone C;
it is remarkably rare in the 
whole region.
Abies cephalonica.
   The dominant tree in Zones
E and above, but patchy in
its occurrence; much of the 
mountain, in vertical stripes,
has only charred stumps.
These burnt areas are
bare limestone rock and scree
[19812-19813]
9812
with scanty maquis and Labi-
atae.  they may be the result
o9f watime conflagrations (see
Aug. 12). The stumps. c. 12"
thick, are now very rotten and
ready to crumble.
   Abies trees usually squat
and spreading in habit and
quite young; typically c. 25 ft
high and 20" thick. The age 
of 127 years (p. 9807) is for an
exceptionally large tree made
into an horse-trough at the Hip-
pocrene. The burning was ap-
parently of a young stand with
few trees >50 years old. No
sign of any stumps.
Abies also occurs on cliffs
and rocks in lower zones and
smallish trees, as already moted,
98134
have spread down to the 
bottom od the saddle. Some
of these trees were evidently
present the last time the oaks
were cut; many of them ap-
pear to have been once pol-
larded at c. 12 ft high,
subsequently growing 2-3 lead-
ers. A fewe Abies apoear to
have been coppiced.
   Young Abies in Zone E is 
much grazed prob. more affec-
ted than Q. coccifera. For this
reason the burnt areas are
slow to recolonize; but the
young firs are there, especially
towards the edges, in pockets
of soil, and will eventiu9814lly
struggle upwards and get
away.
[19814-19815]
9814
Many Abies trees are full
of mistletoe which occasionally
dominates the fopiage; indeed
occasional trees have only
mistletoe foliage ion their top
or main limbs.
   About 10% of the bigger Abies
on the cliffs have died in he last 
few years. Unknown cause.

[DIAG]

Valley of the Muses. A quiet
uninhabited, mainly cultivsted
valley. Several permanaent
streams, with poplars, (chiefly
hybrids), Arundo beds, etc.
9815
Little remains of the numerous
chapels, except Ayia Paraskevi.
Many hedges in theS.E. part
of the vsalley. Chief crops are
cereals snd olives, with some
vines. Some abandoned terra-
cing on the S.E. flanks of 
Koursana, but terraces in gen-
eral are rare as they usu-
ally are in the region.

   Two ancient towers: a fan-
tastic medieval ruin 1 1/2km
WNW of Panayia, and a
classical tower crowning the
hill Pyrgaki, ancient Astera, as
it did in Pansanias's time.
   Many roads and tracks.
A very rough road, recently
made just motorable, traverses
the valley and goes over the
[19816-19817]
9816
Zagora saddle.

Hippocrene. Kryo Pigadhi
is a well, triangular in sec-
tion, roughly 8 ft x 10 ft
deep to water. It is lined with great
squared blocks, apparently of
classical masonry. It widens
at the bottom to a square
shape. Prob-
ably it was
originally
rectangu-
lar in sec-   [DIAG]
tion, but 
one end
has partly
collapsed and one
side has come to overhang.
The missiong end has been
9817
roughly built up in rubble.
Most of the bottom on the
uncollapsed side, is taken
up by a grest rock. The
water apoears not to flow
and is 2 ft deep.
   The well is in a glade
of the thin fir-wood, surroun-
ded by trees prob. 100 years
old. It is appoached from
the E. by the little-used
remains of a well-made track,
some 3-4 ft wide and care-
fully graded.  The surroundings
of the well are much visitefd
by goats. A horse-trough is
the only furniture.
  To drink of the well I
had come with a string whereon
to let down a cup, weighted
[19818-19819]
9818
with a suitble stone; but
owing to the overhang it was 
not easy to reach the water
   The well is not, as Frazer
describes, provided with foot-
holds, and the ivy which
he describes as a ladder has
shrunk to a single tewn uous
plant. Margaret with assist-
ance and great difficulty
clambered down to collect
a tuft of a Eurychium
sp.  growing on the rock just
above the water: the first
damp moss we had seen in
Boeotia.
   The water tasted faintly
of goat and was cold. It
gave some poetic inspiration,
but more came from the mag-
9819
nificent view embracing much
of the plain of Copais and
of the various lesser moun-
tains south of it.

Hedges. Numerous on the 
S. facing cultivsted hillsides
of Evangelistria, in the next
valley N. of Kansara.

Deciduous Oaks.   Occasional
as field trees in the valley
of the Muses down to c. 450
m. (A single Abies was
noted st c. 600m.)

  Wrens and other small birds
are abundant in the decidu-
ous-oak belt.
   Mountsin csttle have bells
[19820-19821]
9820
just like those in the Alps.

Acer orientale. The rarest of 
the deciduous trees seen; it
was not noted to be specially
sensitive to grazing.

    Nobody was seen a day
after leaving the valley.
