This is evidently the remains of
an oil-mill, in a small vslley 1 km
SSW of Mavrommati church. It
contains:
(1) A vertical, evidently hand-
screwed press, made in Greece.
(2) Steam-engine, made in Gran-
tham. Piston missing, one flywheel
broken.
(3) Grinding mill, of two mill-
stones working on a bed. The
plan shows this in relation to the
steam-engine.
(4) Boiler for steam-engine,
apparently of a primitive ver-
tical type.

Hedges.  Frequent in area S
and SW of Mavrommati, on
steepish slopes within 1 km

Not evident whether they are

system.

Maquis-garrigue slopes of branch 
of ravine running N.E. from
