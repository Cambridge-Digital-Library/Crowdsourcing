This is evidently the remains of
an oil-mill, in a small vslley 1 km
SSW of Mavrommati church. It
contains:
(1) A vertical, evidently hand-
screwed press, made in Greece.
(2) Steam-engine, made in Gran-
tham. Piston missing, one flywheel
broken.
(3) Grinding mill, of two mill-
stones working on a bed. The
plan shows this in relation to the
steam-engine.
(4) Boiler for steam-engine,
apparently of a primitive ver-
tical type.

Hedges.  Frequent in area S
and SW of Mavrommati, on
steepish slopes within 1 km

Alcea pallida ssp cretica was
seen in open garrigue. Strikingly
green and turgid; still in full
flower.
  Foenicidium frequent in fields,
the usual Greek plant, with rather
sparse lf-segs. smells of aniseed,
but is not Anethum.
   Heliotropium hirstissimum is
one of the commonest fallowfield
weeds around here.
   Osyris alba scarce near foot
of slope.
   Many households at Mavro
mmati keep a few sheep in
the yard; they are fed on hay
etc. A few keep rabbits,
which are allowed to run
loose in the yard.

   The most recent planta-
tion is this year's; it has in-
volved more elaborate prepara-

terracing the slope with a bull-

PLAIN OF THISBE

GUF OF DOMVRENA
9795
   The hills between the
Plain of Thisbe and the sea
are in general very hesvily
grazed with numerous sheep-
folds.
   The Tsaria peninsula is
apparently less grazed, with
tall maquis covering about
60% of the surface. No visi-
ble buildings. Some of the is-
lands in the gulf appear to
be wholly maquis-covered, but
this varies from island to island.
  Vathy is a deep cliff-sided
inhospitable inlet.  

Plain of Thisbe.
   A basin, aplarently land-
locked, with nearly level
floor sloping slightly towards
[19796-19797]
9796
the SW, Allegedly a lake in
classical  times, divided in two
by a dyke which enabled half
of it to be cultivsted at one
time (Pausanias). The remains
of this dyke can clearly be seen
in the form of huge ashlar
blocks, sometimes 2-3 courses
high; at the S. end it forms
the base of the modern N-S
road across the basin, but
at the N end it diverges a
few ft to the W.  Tew bridge 
carrying the road across the
dried-up ceneal channel arch 
is a  asub-modern arch on
massive classical abutments.
   The plain has long been
divided into narrow strips of
farmland; it has no trace of
9797
water or aquatic vegetation.
The main crop is corn with
olives on the marginal slppes.
   In looking for a auitsble
place to tke a core, we
came upon a  very extensive set-
tlement site: pottery and tiles
of an extensive Classicasl period
thickly scattered over many
acres, down to the bottom of
the olive zone.
   No trace of peat or silt
found: the soil is a sandy
clay and is brick=-hard to
many feet deep. Cracks are
up to 3" across and at
least 2 ft deep. We damaged
the Hiller borer in trying to
take a core.
A commercial borehole in
[19798-19799]
9798
the basin revealed a series of
muds and clays, including
possible lake silts at great
depth.

   For the remains of anci-
ent Thisbe, see 18 Aug.
   A few drops of rain fell
at Thisbe.

Mavrommati Patronal Festival
   Held on the nights of 4,5,6
Aug.
   Little religious observance, tho'
the ikons were paraded around
the [????] and we were told
there was a procession to a near-
by monastery.
   Of the five [????] in
Mavrommati, three had bands
9799
consisting of a singer and three
instuments (e.g. el;ctic gui-
tar, fiddle (with micpohone
attached) and a small drum.
The works were mainly By-
zantine pop music of a very
repetitive kind, though attempts
were made at other genres
(e.g. Hava Naguila). This en-
tertsined the many hundred
revellers who crowded into
Mavrommati for the occasion.
The noise was deafening;
the equipment was run at
full volume beyond the point
at which it amplified pro=-
perly. Customers sat solemnly 
drinking within a few 
yards of the machinery,
apparently taking not the least
[19800-19801]
9800
notice: indeed, apart from a
few perfunctory attempts to dance
the syrta, the customers seemed
to ignore the musicians.
   Our own house had a little 
band consisting of an old and
elaborately inlaid bowzouki,
a large clarinet-like keyed instru-
ment and a drum.
   The various bands played
without any coordination. They
began at 8 p.m. and they
suddenly finished, in accor-
dance with a new licensibng
law, though talking snd revell-
ing continued until dawn.
The villagee slept the fol]owing
day.
