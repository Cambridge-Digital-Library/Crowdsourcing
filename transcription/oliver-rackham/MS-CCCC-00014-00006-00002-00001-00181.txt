October 9.
  One of the gourd plants
has produced two small
fruits.
  Tropeolum canariense
eventually produced two plants,
one of which is going on to
flower.
  The biennial apple trees
outside my rooms have
produced no fruit at all
this year.

and remain half open for
at least 3 days.
October 12.
  Volunteer barley plants
in the field at Trumpington  
are heavily infected with
an orange aecidial leaf
rust.
October 13.
  Repairs are now nearly
finished to the dry rot in
lysimeter box no. 1 at
Trumpington.  Decay as
follows:
1. Merulius (mycelial strands,
cubical rot, characteristic
smell). Started from a
second-hand deal post screwed
to the inside of the box.
3797
Penetrated the 1 1/4" thick teak
planks under the post and
spread laterally.  The greater
part of this side of the
box appears to be covered
with a net of mycelial
strands.  Except directly
under the post, decay has
been only on the inside of 
the box in contact with the
ground, and mainly super-
ficial.
2. A wet cheesey rot, mot-
tled with yellow and gray,
not cubical.  In two places
near the bottom of the box.
3. Soft brown superficial decay
inside the box in places
permanently damp.

  The eastern Hayley Lane
hedge continues N. of the
B1046, apparently as pure
elm.
  3 maples and an ash
along the wood-bank by
the Triangle bear evidence
of hedge-trimming.
  Just inside the old wood
is a crab-apple tree about
40 ft high and 2 ft dia.
Leaves nearly glabrous.
  The 1971 coppice plot
has very little ash.  No
large stools, although there
are a few just outside.

[13802-13803]
3802
Several maiden trees.
  This plot has many
fine oaks, some smallish
oaks down to c. 8 in. dia.
Oak canopy c. 50%
  Numerous small maple
stools.
  Hazel often large and
non-self-coppicing, up to
c. 4 in. dia. branches.
  Very few funguses in
the Wood.
  The maples in the coppice
plots which nearly died
last year continue to
recover; but many of the
ashes are going back.
The Pond is very low
and the mud much churned
3803
up.
  Callitriche apparently
only on 1st North Ride.
  3rd North Ride much 
blocked by fallen Prunus.
  All the lorry tyres which 
filled the cutting from Hayley
Wood to the Littlehound
Spinney have been consumed
in a gigantic fire.  Length
of cutting [!!!!1608ft] 1850 ft.
Mean width 45 ft. Mean
depth 10 ft -3 this gives
1850 x 45 x 10 x 20 
-------------------- = 7400

tons of tyres.  The sides
of the cutting are totally
scorched and the floor

[13804-13805]
3804
covered with a thick smoul-
dering deposit of ash and
wire.  Hayley Wood is ap-
parently untouched, Little-
hound apparently totally
blackened. [SYMBOL 26, 27]
  There is a small deposit
of tyres in the cutting op-
posite the North Section, and
a number inside the N.W.
corner of the Wood. [SYMBOL 28]
  Just outside the N.W. 
corner is a deposit of mag-
got factory waste.  A dried
membranous blood-red sub-
stance incorporating the
bones of fowls.  Only a few 
square yards remain in
the surface, but more may
3805
have been plowed in.  A
curious sweetish smell was
obtrusive in a limited area
of the N.W. of the Wood and
also along Hayley Lane (see
map);  the latter is probably
from Gransden Lodge farm
(fresh W. wind).
6. Calvatia gigantea [!!!!]  One about
5 yards into the Wood in
the West Section (Toby Bar-
rett).

23. Fistulina hepatica. A
young one at the base of an 
oak, N.W. corner.  A full
grown one (with a dorsal
stalk [DIAG] coming through

the undamaged bark of the
middle of the trunk of an
old oak in the Triangle hedge.
  The deer [(!!!!] (3) were
seen at Post K as the cop-
picing party arrived;  and
in the afternoon (after 
much work had been done)
by two of us in the midst
of the West Section.
  Acorn crop appears to
have been scanty.
3809
Oct. 21.  D.E. Coombe, J. Lee'
Buff Wood.   G McBride.
  Near the North Gate an
ash standard abput 15in dia.
has broken off obliquely c. 12 ft
up.  Cause:  extensive squa-
mous rot from a snag.  The
larger part of the fallen
trunk has been sawn away 
and has disappeared.

Elm Disease
  None seen in the handle 
or in the N.E. elm circle,
although leaf fall is very
irregular, the tops of trees
and trees at the edge
being almost bare while
the shaded twigs have

[13810-13811]
3810
green leaves.
  Tree A (heavily affected
in the past) shows no signs
this year and the lower
branches are vigorous.
  At B two trees c. 6"
dia. show considerable death
at the top, with dead leaves
hanging and bent shoot
ends.
  Silaus is abundant
by the track opposite the N.
W. gate.
Mercury very wilted 
where it occurs [!!!!] in 
thew old wood.
A fine plant of Serratula
with two flowering stems
3811
was found (D.E.C.) near
the cross-rods.
  Most of the hornbeam
stools on the l1968 coppice
appear to be dead.  The
promoted hornbeams are
growing slowly but appear
healthy;  even where rhe
crown has been lost the
trunk sprouts.  Ash coppices
quite well in this area
despite the dense Juncus.
Clitocybe geotropa.  One seen.
Very dry.

  The whole wood is very 
dry. Pond C is dry; Pond
D is full and the water level
[13812-13813]
3812
has hardly gone down.
  The parent elm of the 
N.E. elm area has a white
wet-wood stain emerging
from a snag.  the suckers
appear unaffected.  Those
at the margin of the elm
area (abutting on ash cop-
pice with occasional horn-
beam Lc) are small pole
size.
  One of the large stan-
dard hornbeams (at E)
has a lot of light under
it as a result of the
1968 coppicing.  There are
numerous poplar suckers
which have grown c. 2 Ft
in the last 3 years.
3813
  Aspen suckers have
lost many of their leaves
while the large trees are
still green.

Works on the rides
  S.E. ride.  A land drain
laid 2ft 6 deep under the
middle of the ride, back
filled largely with gravel.
Discharges into the moat
and th S.W. ride ditch.
  Bridge over the moat:
made of split sash poles c.
[DIAG]
8 in. dia. and a few larch

[13814-13815]
3814
and Douglas. Laid hiorzon-
tally and vertically and
secured with wedges &
pegs.  Iron pipe at bottom.
  S.W. ride.  Ditch dug
out to 2' deep with a 
mechanical digger along
the old line but with de-
viations aroud stools &
trees.  Spoil mainly on S.E.
at the N.E. end, where it 
forms an acute bank.
In the S.W. part much
less spoil has been re-
moved, and it has been 
thrown mainly on the N.W.
side and more spread out.
  A few sycamores and
other trees are to be re-
3815
moved on the S.W. side
of the S.E. ride within the
moat.
  No pottery has been found.
Two very thick Gryphaea-like
multi-layered oyster shells,
one with serpulid tubes.

  A group of sapling horn-
beams c. 3ft hiogh in the
1971 coppice area.
The 1971 coppice contains
about 6 groups of aspens.
No Populus canadensis.

Many small hedged
fields remain S.E. of Buff
Wood, and even a patch
of permanent grass to the
