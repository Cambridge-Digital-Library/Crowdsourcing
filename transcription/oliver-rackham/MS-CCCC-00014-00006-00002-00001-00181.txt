October 9.
  One of the gourd plants
has produced two small
fruits.
  Tropeolum canariense
eventually produced two plants,
one of which is going on to
flower.
  The biennial apple trees
outside my rooms have
produced no fruit at all
this year.

rust.
October 13.
  Repairs are now nearly
finished to the dry rot in
lysimeter box no. 1 at
Trumpington.  Decay as
follows:
1. Merulius (mycelial strands,
cubical rot, characteristic
smell). Started from a
second-hand deal post screwed
to the inside of the box.
3797
Penetrated the 1 1/4" thick teak
planks under the post and
spread laterally.  The greater
part of this side of the
box appears to be covered
with a net of mycelial
strands.  Except directly
under the post, decay has
been only on the inside of 
the box in contact with the
ground, and mainly super-
ficial.
2. A wet cheesey rot, mot-
tled with yellow and gray,
not cubical.  In two places
near the bottom of the box.
3. Soft brown superficial decay
inside the box in places
permanently damp.

  The eastern Hayley Lane
hedge continues N. of the
B1046, apparently as pure
elm.
  3 maples and an ash
along the wood-bank by
the Triangle bear evidence
of hedge-trimming.
  Just inside the old wood
is a crab-apple tree about
40 ft high and 2 ft dia.
Leaves nearly glabrous.
  The 1971 coppice plot
has very little ash.  No
large stools, although there
are a few just outside.

[13802-13803]
3802
Several maiden trees.
  This plot has many
fine oaks, some smallish
oaks down to c. 8 in. dia.
Oak canopy c. 50%
  Numerous small maple
stools.
  Hazel often large and
non-self-coppicing, up to
c. 4 in. dia. branches.
  Very few funguses in
the Wood.
  The maples in the coppice
plots which nearly died
last year continue to
recover; but many of the
ashes are going back.
The Pond is very low
and the mud much churned
3803
up.
  Callitriche apparently
only on 1st North Ride.
  3rd North Ride much 
blocked by fallen Prunus.
  All the lorry tyres which 
filled the cutting from Hayley

tons of tyres.  The sides
of the cutting are totally
scorched and the floor

[13804-13805]
3804
covered with a thick smoul-
dering deposit of ash and
wire.  Hayley Wood is ap-
parently untouched, Little-
hound apparently totally
blackened. [SYMBOL 26, 27]
  There is a small deposit
of tyres in the cutting op-
posite the North Section, and
a number inside the N.W.
corner of the Wood. [SYMBOL 28]
  Just outside the N.W. 
corner is a deposit of mag-
got factory waste.  A dried
membranous blood-red sub-
stance incorporating the
bones of fowls.  Only a few 
square yards remain in
the surface, but more may
3805
have been plowed in.  A
curious sweetish smell was
obtrusive in a limited area
of the N.W. of the Wood and
also along Hayley Lane (see
map);  the latter is probably
from Gransden Lodge farm
(fresh W. wind).
6. Calvatia gigantea [!!!!]  One about
5 yards into the Wood in
the West Section (Toby Bar-
rett).

23. Fistulina hepatica. A
young one at the base of an 
oak, N.W. corner.  A full

Oct. 21.  D.E. Coombe, J. Lee'
Buff Wood.   G McBride.
  Near the North Gate an
ash standard abput 15in dia.
has broken off obliquely c. 12 ft
up.  Cause:  extensive squa-
mous rot from a snag.  The
larger part of the fallen
trunk has been sawn away 
and has disappeared.

Elm Disease
  None seen in the handle 
or in the N.E. elm circle,
although leaf fall is very
irregular, the tops of trees
and trees at the edge
being almost bare while
the shaded twigs have

[13810-13811]
3810
green leaves.
  Tree A (heavily affected
in the past) shows no signs
this year and the lower
branches are vigorous.
  At B two trees c. 6"
dia. show considerable death
at the top, with dead leaves
hanging and bent shoot
ends.
  Silaus is abundant
by the track opposite the N.
W. gate.
Mercury very wilted 
where it occurs [!!!!] in 
thew old wood.
A fine plant of Serratula
with two flowering stems
3811
was found (D.E.C.) near
the cross-rods.
  Most of the hornbeam
stools on the l1968 coppice
appear to be dead.  The
promoted hornbeams are
growing slowly but appear
healthy;  even where rhe
crown has been lost the
trunk sprouts.  Ash coppices
quite well in this area
despite the dense Juncus.
Clitocybe geotropa.  One seen.
Very dry.

  The whole wood is very 
dry. Pond C is dry; Pond
D is full and the water level
[13812-13813]
3812
has hardly gone down.
  The parent elm of the 
N.E. elm area has a white
wet-wood stain emerging
from a snag.  the suckers
appear unaffected.  Those
at the margin of the elm
area (abutting on ash cop-
pice with occasional horn-
beam Lc) are small pole
size.
  One of the large stan-
dard hornbeams (at E)
has a lot of light under
it as a result of the
1968 coppicing.  There are
numerous poplar suckers
which have grown c. 2 Ft
in the last 3 years.
3813
  Aspen suckers have
lost many of their leaves
while the large trees are
still green.

Works on the rides
  S.E. ride.  A land drain
laid 2ft 6 deep under the
middle of the ride, back
filled largely with gravel.
Discharges into the moat
and th S.W. ride ditch.
  Bridge over the moat:
made of split sash poles c.
[DIAG]
8 in. dia. and a few larch

[13814-13815]

and Douglas. Laid hiorzon-
tally and vertically and
secured with wedges &
pegs.  Iron pipe at bottom.
  S.W. ride.  Ditch dug
out to 2' deep with a 
mechanical digger along
the old line but with de-
viations aroud stools &
trees.  Spoil mainly on S.E.
at the N.E. end, where it 
forms an acute bank.
In the S.W. part much
less spoil has been re-
moved, and it has been 
thrown mainly on the N.W.
side and more spread out.
  A few sycamores and
other trees are to be re-
3815
moved on the S.W. side
of the S.E. ride within the
moat.
  No pottery has been found.
Two very thick Gryphaea-like
multi-layered oyster shells,
one with serpulid tubes.

  A group of sapling horn-
beams c. 3ft hiogh in the
1971 coppice area.
The 1971 coppice contains
about 6 groups of aspens.
No Populus canadensis.

Many small hedged
fields remain S.E. of Buff
Wood, and even a patch
of permanent grass to the

[DIAG]
3817
S.W. of Hilbein's
Farm.

  No sign of 
Dutch elm disease
noted on the way
to the Wood. In
Wimpole Avenue the
trees are very vari-
able in leaf fall,
some almost bare
and others entirely
green.  This affects
whole trees rather
than branches, and
early or late trees
are in 2s, 3s or 4s
rather than singly.

Oct 24.
Madingley Wood
The great ash to the
S.E. of the large clearing
has collapsed.

[DIAG]
[13820-13821]
3820
[DIAG]

Stage I.  About 1/2 of 
the crown fell on the
edge of the clearing.
Fallen part 37 p (89 ft)
long.  Fell on as hazel
but withut seriously
damaging it.  Probably
soon after leaf expansion
this year.
Slight healing of 
the enormous wound
took place. Stage 2
3821
was in the gale a few 
days ago.

Stage II.  Remainder of
crown falls.  Flattens a
small maple on this side
of the ride, falls across the
ride, flattens some pole
ashes on the other side.

Tree about 96 ft jigh,
2 1/2 ft dia.  Collapse due to
squamosus rot in crotch.
  Clearing has been at
least doubled.

Small clearing.  No canopy
gap now.  Oak to the N.
is overtopt by elms and

[13822-13823]
3822
going back.

Impatiens.  None at
small clearing.

Large population at
photosite in old pots,
spreading  a few yds (c.10)
beyond pots.
Small population at 
large clearing, around
pots only.

The spread round the 
photosite is into a thin
stand of mercury and
Glechoma with sparse nettles.
  In belt Ia a large
ash has snapt off at the top
and fallen across a ride.
3823
At the S.W. corner, an
ash has broken off about
20 ft up and 
lodged against

[DIAG]

other trees.
All these fallen ashes
are large trees of c. 1800.
Probably caused by squa-
mosus rot.
A very large maple pole
has fallen (lodged) in sec. 6

[13824-13825]

[13826-13827]
3826
A ride about 10 ft wide
has been made just inside
the rabbit fence of most
of the old wood.  It has
involved very little felling
of scrub and no alteration
of earthworks. Probably on
the site of a former ride.
  Most of the elms are
nearly leafless.  No elm dis-
ease seen. No more falls
of elm.
No acorn crop.
October 25.
  There is a substantial
acorn crop on trees at
the far end of Leckhampton.

large, rsther rugose, no
tuft of hairs in axils of
veins, underside very hairy,
petiole stout.  No epicormics.
Bark rather rough. Fruit
strongly ribbed, very woody.  Clearly
T. platyphyllus.  All these
trees have been pollarded
c. 10 ft up in the distant
past.  Trunk dia. c. 2 ft.
(ii) 4 trees clearly T.
europea.  Bsrk smoother,
leaves smaller and falling
later.  Epicormics very
dense.  These trees are
3831
           Trunk dia. 2 ft.
scattered in the avenue.
(iii) One tree, near the 
cross-roads. Trunk dia.
c. 1 1/2 ft. Not pollarded. No epicormics.
Leaves like T. Cordata
but rather largr;  some-
what hairy, with conspi-
cuous brown axillary
tufts.  Bark like T. cordata.
Probably the avenue
was planted with T. platy-
phyllus c. 1700.  After the 
pollarding phase, gaps
appeared and were filled
by planting T. europaea.
One tree with a majority 
of T. cordata genes
also got in as a replace-
ment.

[13832-13833]

  Several trees becasme
decrepit and were felled
a few years ago.  Rings 
sometimes c. 6 mm but
often c. 1/2 mm. Some of
the stumps may be c. 100
years old.  It is possible
that there may be a larger
proportion of T. europaea
among the stumps than
among surviving trees.
These stumps must be 
planed before any attempt
to count them.  This
avenue appears on the 
1 in. O.S. Other groups
of T. platyphyllyus occur
in the park.
3833
Ulmus procera (typical)
is frequent. No carpini-
folia seen.
  A curious elm with
the habit of U. stricta and
dense foliage of very
small leaves is planted 
near the fish-pond.
  Mr Soames-Jenyns
says that he and his
father have planted many
trees.
  The S. hedge of the 
park is a mixed one of
3-4 spp including Acer
campestre.
  Around the house 
there sre some yews of
2-3 ft dia.

[13834-13835]
3834
  In the garden and
Rookery Wood there are
a few giant beeches
c. 100ft high and c. 6 ft
dia.  Most of these are
over-mature and some 
held together by cables.
Probably fast-grown. One
recently dead.  Beeches
are frequent as free-
standing trees in the 
park:  possibly old pollard,
but comparatively fast
grown.
  A rather small cedar
of Lebanon by the garden.
  Rookery Wood is
very mixed.  Apparently
of ornamental origin.
3835
Some very large over-
mature ashes.  Two
giant planes. Several big
oaks.  The largest part
is recent plantations of
sycamore and spruce.
Numerous ornamentals
by the lake.  Mr S-J
draws attention to the
ivy & nettles which are
very abundant.  No 
mercury seen.  Humulus
abundant in the peat 
area.
  The fish-pond is
a shallow excavation 
about 1 1/2ft deep, fed
by a stream from White-
land Springs, which has  

[13836-13837]
3834
been dry for some time,
Mr S-J complains of over-
-extraction from boreholes.
  A Carpinus by the
pond is c. 40 ft high with
three trunks each of c.
1 1/2ft from near the
ground.  No evidence of
pollarding or coppicing.
A single free-standing
tree of remarkable size.
  By a shaliow ditch
stands an oak c. 4 ft
dia, rather tall, un-
pollarded, evidently a 
very old slow-grown tree.
[!!!!] In a corner of
a field nearby is a 
venerable maple.  The
3837
hollow trunk, c. 3ft dia,
stands on s plinth-like
base.  Apparently pollar-
ded, but forming s tall
main stem which has
broken off.
A tree     [DIAG]
still 
vigorous 
with peculiar 
leaves,
to 3 1/4 in long on a 3 1/2 in
petiole, very hairy, lobes
blunt & parallel-sided,
abundant latex. Thr
broken-off top, about
1 ft dia, has microscopic 
rings.

[13838-13839]
3838
  Gray squirrels have 
killed the top 10 ft of
several pole-sized sycamores.
  Grassland mixed but
not of much interest at
this time of year.  Let
out to a local farmer and
over-grazed by bullocks.
Apparently mainly old 
pasture.
  Several plants od Dipoa-
cus pilosus to 7 ft high
in a glade of Rookery
Wood.
  Mr S.-J. says the
Jenyns family bought the
estate in the early 18th
cent.  The old house was
