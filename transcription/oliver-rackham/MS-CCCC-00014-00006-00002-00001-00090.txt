the 1965 plot revealed but
two small plants.
[TABLE] Viola reichenbachiana
is flowering abundantly in
the coppice plots and on
the nearby main ride.
[TABLE] Epilobium montanum
appears to be the only sp. in
the coppice plots.
[TABLE] Fragania vesca and Potentilla

and on bonfire sites.
[TABLE] A second partly felled oak
was found in the N. quad-
rant, about 10 yards
across the main ride from
N°.3 corner post. It had
been cut into with an
axe all round and sub-
sequently died and
fallen. The roots rotted
throngh so that the
rotched trunk is still intact.
[TABLE] A plant of Oxalis acetosella
was found by the main
N.E. ride opposite the 1964
coppice plot.


[7312-7313]

[TABLE] Around most of the
oaks on the two coppiced
areas, there are bare areas
[!!!!]patches[!!!!] with much dis-
turbance of the ground,
up to about 1½ ft from
the tree bases. This may
be due to rabbits but there
is little evidence for this.

sometimes branches, giving
rise to clusters of rosettes.

Two glow worms were

lanceolate insects about
1 in.  long. The light [DIAG]
comes from discrete
luminous dots
at one end of
the animal. There
are 9 such dots, [!!!!] 5 in
one row and 4 in another;
two fainter dots exist towards

N.E. from Tréveray.
[TABLE] These woods are all
on steep slopes, the floor
of the valley being a
narrow strip of hayfields

in structure and compo-
sition according to aspect.
On S. facing slopes, they
appear to be mainly
maquis of recent origin
invading grassland.
[TABLE] All the common local
trees are abundant. The
woods are mainly deciduous,
thongh Picea and Pinus
are abundant, the former

dominant in places on
