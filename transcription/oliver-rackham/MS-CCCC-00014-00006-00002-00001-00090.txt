coppice plot.


[7312-7313]

brunnen and on the higher
peaks. Mistletoes  grows abun-
dantly on it near Silberbrun-
nen.
[TABLE] Ivy grows frequently in
the woods of the E. Kaiserstuhl.
[TABLE] The only Tilia seen in the E.
Kaiserstuhl is T. Cordata, wich
is abundant, thongh not often
as a timber tree.
[TABLE] Artemisia campestris is
frequent on steep banks on
various aspects around Sche-
lingen and Vogtsburg.
[TABLE] Aster was seen in one place
on a steep bank above Vogtsburg.
[TABLE] Many of the steep grassy
slopes (30° and over) in the


[7350-7351]

central Kaiserstuhl around
Schelingen and Vogtsburg were
formely main but have
now gone out of cultivation.
They have revested to rough
grass and are being invaded by
bush.
[TABLE] Larch does not appear
to be native to the Kaiserstuhl,
but has recently been
much planted on the higher
mountains.
[TABLE] Trivia is abundant on
roadsides and abandoned
grassland in the hills above
Vogtsburg.
[TABLE] Another storks' nest was
seen in Bahlingen: a similar
mass of sticks on a special
wooden platform on the ridge

of a house in the middle of
the town.
[TABLE] A strange, probably hybrid,
Crataegus or Sorbus was
found at the edge of a
wood above Vogtsburg. An
unamed shrub.   (C. laevigata)
[TABLE] Seed of Impatiens noli-
-tangere was collected from a
large stand of the plant on a S.E.
facing slope of the high
Kaisestuhl above and below
the road from Silberbrunnen to
Schelingen. Site in a shallow
gulley in mixed forest with
some clearing. Plants are weak
and mildewed, although
they probably see the sun
for short periods. Seed produc-
tion appears to be very low

previous years.

[TABLE] Another storks'nest was
seen at Gottenheim, on a 
wooden platform erected on
the ridge of the church tower
(which has a 2-gabled roof).
[TABLE] The storks are said to
build only [!!!!] in one place in a village or
town, and to come back to
the same nest for many
years, some of the nests being


[7354-7355]

Very old. They sometimes
appear to miss a year in
any one place. The nests are
originally built on chimneys,
&c., but are [????] no nally moved
by the householders onto
wooden platforms. Their
numbers are slowly declining.

[TABLE] Convallaria occurs up

[TABLE] This is a short turf on
the gently-sloping summits
of Kandel; undoubtedly of
artificial origin and main-
tained probably by grazing.
It is much damaged by ex-
cessive walking and motoring.

Beech. Occurs, at least as
a small constituent of the


[7356-7357]

forest, almost everywhere
in Ettersbachtal and on Kan-
del. Sometimes forms almost
pure stands on the adret
at low altitudes. Ther
are large pure stands at
c. 1200 m, but these have
none of the cloud forest
caracter seen in the Vosges,
Thes trees are straight
about 50ft high, with
only a moderate growth
of lichens, and show
no effect of wind. Ground
flora poor.
[TABLE] The forest otherwise
consists mainly of Picea
and Abies, the former
being more abudant on
the ubac and at higher

altitudes (to 1200 m.).
Abies occasionally reaches
a large size. All the forest
is hignly managed. Pine
is abundant especially
at low altitudes on the
adret. Ash and sycamore
are occasional among other
species.
[TABLE] In the region of the
Linie [!!!!] (i.e. thefrontier between
Baden & Württemberg) [!!!!] is a
considerable area of flat
ground at c. 1000 m. This
may be an extinct bog;
it covered with an open
wood of young conifers
(mainly pine) with heath-
land of Vaccinium myrtllus
betwenn. This is fruiting


[7358-7359]

abundantly and people
gather the fruits into
buckets with an instrument
resembling a shovel
with long comb-teeth in front.
[TABLE] Digitalis purpurea is abun-
dant at the edges of clearings
in the forest: not in full
sun, nor in dense shade.
[TABLE] Prenanthes is very abun-
dant in shady places up
to 1100 m. It does not
extend far into clearings.
It was seen wilting in a
large sun-fleck. It is
rhizomatous.
[TABLE] Senecio fuchsii is very
abundant in the lighter parts
of woods and in clearings

where it flourishes in full sun
and may be locally dominant.

2. Phallus impudicus. One
expanded one and two eggs,
in a pure spruce wood. Seen
about 1 p.m. when the
expanded one was almost
odourless, but covered with
flies.

3. Laccaria amethystina. Fre-
quent in small groups under
conifers. Entirely violet, tinged
with brownish above, Sp. white
(X20). No other Laccaria was
seen.

4. Lactarius glyciosmus ([????]sensa

Moser). Once seen, a small
group under spruce.

5. Several in groups on a
woodland drove, under conifers.

[TABLE] Aruncus is abundant on
the Linie plateau.
[TABLE] Rhytidiadelphus loreus
and Plagiothecium undulatum
are abundant in the
shady part of the somewhat
wet area at about 1000 m.
around the Linie.
