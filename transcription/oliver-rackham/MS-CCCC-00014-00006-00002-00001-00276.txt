         Grass Balds.
there can be little dout that
tne present balds are the remnant
of [???? Alnuveiden] which extended 
almost continuously from Double
Spring to Silers Bald Shelter and
beyond.
   They have fringes opf Rubus
canadensis, Amelanchier, Rhododendron
calend, Vaccinium spp and of
1381
young beech. Most of the inter-
vening ridge is clothed with even-
aged beech and  scattered buck-
eye (p. 1259). Much of this appears
to have grown up after the suppres-
sion of grazing c. 1912.
   Occasional ancient trees - beech,
birch, buckeye, black cherry - occur
among young woods around Silers
Bald Shelter and elsewhere. These
are probably rewmnants of the
"orchad-like" stands of trees
in 19th-cent. accounts of the balds.
   The balds are evidently a
wood-pasture syatem of grassland
and scattered big trees. They began
in the early 19th cent. apparently
as part of a system of feeding cattle
and sheep in the woods. There was
difficulty in defending livestock from
[21382-21383]
1382
bears & lyons [Q. was there ever
a system of using leaf-fodder?
This type of grazing would otherwise
have been precarious and lable
to unexpectred failures.]
   When grazing was abandoned
balds rapidly reverterd to woodland.
Beech was probably favoured because
irs root-systems wuukd already
have been there.

Ramps. Looks very like Allium
ursinum. The subject of popular
feasting in "Ramps Festivals" and
from the Nstional Park conswerva-
toon byelaws

Fornes igniarius. This or a similar
"conk" is abundant on old beeches
1383
and other trees, e.g., around Buckeye
Gap ([SYMBOL]19)

Yellow Birch. At Buckeye Gap
are several clumps fused at the
base but apparently of genetically
separate individuals. [SYMBOL] 28.

Impatiens sp. One of the commonest
herbs of damp shady woods. Looks 
very like I. noli-tangere at thids
stage; said to be unidentifiable.


Rhododendron maximum. Quite
absent on the stateline ridge.
Abundant on Miry Ridge. Often
forming dense thickets of great
stools through which the path
runs as a "rhododendron tunnel".
([SYMBOL] 33).
[21384-21385]
1384
Polygonum sp. A climbing sp. was
seen by me on 13 May and today
abundantly on the narrow parts
of the ridge. New to Tennessee.

Upper Little River. Looked down
into from many points on the
stateline and Miry ridges. Great
system of steep, tangled, unexplored
side-valleys: [SYMBOL] 5. Peter White's am-
bition is to hunt plants in the
steep upper reaches of these places.

Spruce in Miry Ridge. Isolated
population of some scores df trees
at 4800 ft, mainly on N. side of
ridge. All ages of tree including
young ones. In Rhododendron
area (incipient bald) with
scsttered big yellow birches & Sorbus.
1485
Halesia. Appears about 1 mile S.E.
of Buckeye Gap. From there is fre-
quent, mainly vut not ecclusively
in widlwood, throughout miry
Ridge and Dripping /spring and
don to 2700 ft nesr EWllemont.
As abundant here as anywhere;
almost sole  dominant in places ([SYMBOL]34
at D.W. of Miry Ridge.
Taste: p. 1374.
Habit: p. 1375. Self-pollarding
is more evident at higher altitudes,
coppicing at lower (?following logging).

Bear. Turds very large, fox-shaped,
nearly black. Miry Ridge.

Dripping Spring Mountain
Was evidently mainly chestnut
T-suga, with small areas of pinery
[21386-21387]
1386
and heath-bald. Very abundant
Hsloesia. Most of the chestnut evi-
dently was left by the loggers
and then died; many of the re-
mains are still standing up to 30 ft
high (more than in ither plances seen
hiherto).
   Another barbed-wire enclosure.
   Mountsin is not especially re-
markable for springs; and Miry
Ridge contains no more.
   Death of chestnut partly explains
the unwanted abundance of pin
cherry & ylw birch; some of these
trees, however, are older.
    [Cx brunnesc. & intumesc.]
Limewood. The example on p. 1378 is
the only lime-dominated community
seen in the Appalachians. The ten-
dency of Tilia to form stools is well

   Below 3600m the woods have

are cultivation remains. Wide
range of trees: Lirio, Halesia, Magno-
lia, Aesculus. Vines prominent.

sists of week-end cottages which

seen.
---------------------------
The giant millipede, p. 1322,
is very common. When irritated
it emits a smell of iodoform.

Aristolochia durior (see p. 1392-3).
This magnificent vine is very
common on Huskey Gap Trail and
aometines extends into wildwood.
Forms great tsngled masses of
stems. In full flower. This and
other vines rely on having plenty
of slack between trees which
can be tsken up as the trees move
or if one of them dies.

   The 70 or so trees between 2600 to

   Leguminous trees rather like Rob-
inia. Reaches about 60 ft high and
[21396-21397]
1396
is thus easily over-topt. Smooth
bark which easily grows excrescences.
Bright yellow wood. Leavs pinnate,
with nearly obicular leaflets. Flowers 
in great racemes; white, rather like
Robinia but larger, now in full
flower and leaf (earlier than Rob-
inia).
   Very spectacular flowering: this
is one of the rare good years.
   Self-coppicing tree which forms
massive stool bases. Core of one of
the bases indicates thst it grows
irregularly but probably fast.
   Confined to clitters in gullies in
unlogged areas. Not gregarious. The
big stools are always perched on
clitter (cf Tilia); smaller stools and
occasional maiden trees occur
1397
at the edges of the clitter and a
little way up the middle of the gulley.
   Surrounded by chestnut-oak
in which oak has become predom-
inant. Probably benefitd from death
of chestnut.
   The only trees less than c. 30 ft
high are a few suppressed individu-
als. The tree csn probably live many
years in a suppressed state.
   Four trees were seen along the
main Newfound Gap and opposite
the Nature Tril st sbout 4000 ft*,
All on boulder-trains. At least
one benefited from making the road
c. 1830: it was released and
grew out sideways into the canopy
gap made by rhe road.
