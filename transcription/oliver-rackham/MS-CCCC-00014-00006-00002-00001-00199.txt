Hatfield Forest contd. [DIAG]
Alder Wood
3-4 [!!!!] [!!!!] acres, all in Street Coppice
apart from a tiny area of Hamptons.
The Boundary runs through the
alder area.
Structure variable.  Standards
mainly alder (some recently pro-
rooted as in Bradfield, some over-
grown coppice). Ash & oak cod[????],
with alder in some places. Cover
of standards variable. Alder stds to
c. 1ft dia.
Large coppice sparse, mainly 
Hornbeam.
Small coppice continuous to
sparse.  Alder dominant, mixed in
places with hazel.
[5638-5639]
Poles variable ash & birch.
Coppice structure good, little
scrub.  Vigorous regrowth after cutting.
Ground vegetation mainly
Deschampsia -mercury.

Compariosn with Bradfield:
1. Boundaries fairly sharp in both
cases.
2. In both cases on high ground
forming a watershed.
3  In both cases with apparently
natural streams.
4. In Hatfield alder behaves more
as small coppice.
5. Stools much smaller in Hatfield
with no accumulation of decayed wood.
6. [!!!!] Structure generally similar
in both cases with alder both as
coppice and as promoted stan-
dards.
7. Alder forms a higher proportion
of both layers at Hatfield than
in most of bradfield.

General Features of hatfield Forest.
1. Coppices tend to be on plateaus
above 300ft.
2. [!!!!] Frequent natural hollows
and a few streams, but Porting-
bury Hills are probably a non-
-woodland earthwork.
3. Mainly neutral to calcareous
boulder-clay with little sign
of acidification (e.g. no bracken).
4. Coppices apparently all em-
banked from launds and from
each other, but not from the
Forest boundary.  Banks [????]dially
