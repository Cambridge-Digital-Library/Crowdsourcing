Hatfield Forest contd. [DIAG]
Alder Wood
3-4 [!!!!] [!!!!] acres, all in Street Coppice
apart from a tiny area of Hamptons.
The Boundary runs through the
alder area.
  Structure variable.  Standards
mainly alder (some recently pro-
moted as in Bradfield, some over-
grown coppice). Ash & oak codom,
with alder in some places. Cover
of standards variable. Alder stds to
c. 1ft dia.
  Large coppice sparse, mainly 
Hornbeam.
  Small coppice continuous to
sparse.  Alder dominant, mixed in
places with hazel.
[5638-5639]
5638
  Poles variable ash & birch.
  Coppice structure good, little
scrub.  Vigorous regrowth after cutting.
  Ground vegetation mainly
Deschampsia-mercury.

  Comparison with Bradfield:
1. Boundaries fairly sharp in both
cases.
2. In both cases on high ground
forming a watershed.
3  In both cases with apparently
natural streams.
4. In Hatfield alder behaves more
as small coppice.
5. Stools much smaller in Hatfield
with no accumulation of decayed 
wood.
6. [!!!!] Structure generally similar
in both cases with alder both as
5639
coppice and as promoted stan-
dards.
7. Alder forms a higher proportion
of both layers at Hatfield than
in most of Bradfield.

General features of Hatfield Forest.
1. Coppices tend to be on plateaus
above 300ft.
2. [!!!!] Frequent natural hollows
and a few streams, but Porting-
bury Hills are probably a non-
-woodland earthwork.
3. Mainly neutral to calcareous
boulder-clay with little sign
of acidification (e.g. no bracken).
4. Coppices apparently all em-
banked from launds and from
each other, but not from the
Forest boundary.  Banks usually
[5640-5641]
5640
sinuous or curving. Corners roun-
ded. The following are straight:
Spittlemore to Street
4 sides of Elgin
E. side of Hangman's 
5. List of trees & shrubs:
Oak                   Exotic: Q. cerris
Ash                           Pinus nigra
Maple                         Aesculus
Elm - carpinif.               Castanea
Hornbeam                      Beech
Alder                         Larch
Birch - pub.                  Sycamore
      - verr.
Hazel
Hawthorn - mono . only
Sallow - cap.
Aspen - local, not in W. coppices
Blackthorn
Elder
5641
?Pinus sylv.
Dogwood
Cherry (only in W. coppices)
Clematis
Rhamnus
Rosa can.
     arv.
Salix alba
Lonicera
(23)

6. No boundary pollards (absence
significasnt).
7. Two curious very large ponds
in  the N.E. coppices.
8. Most coppice boundaries carry
remains of iron fences and some
have remains of planted hawthrn
hedges.
9. Woodland structure extremely
[5642-5643]
5642
variable over short distances. Prob-
ably originally 2- or 3-layered but
areas converterd to poles or scrub.
10. Plateau alder wood - 4th or 
5th known example.
11. Elms uniformly scattered
through the coppices with a slight
concentration around margins
(both coppice-coppice and coppice
-laurel). Mainly suckering
but in places (e.g. N. side of Street)
they coppice quite extensively.
Invasion slow, low density, with
little effect on other trees. Massive
invasion leading to a pure stand
occurs in the N. of Hamplon's & 
Street and (to a lesser extent)
the W. of Hangman's. Elms rarely
occur as emergents, except along
the whole S.W. side of Spittlemore.
5642
Such an elm distribution is
not known anywhere else.
12. Maple much more bundant 
than ash. [!!!!] The latter seldom forms
an appreciable part of the large
coppice.
13. Hornbeam with a definite S.
and E. distribution, but usually
not forming well-defined patches.
14. Clematis very abundant, espe-
cially round margins of coppices.
15. Cherry local, mainly marginal.
16. Aspen very local.
17. Hornbeam provides the only
large stools, and these are few.
18. Coppice regrowth generally
about as good as Hayley 1965.
19. Grazing in coppices.
20. Deschampsia dominates most
of the ground vegetation.
[5644-5645]
5644
21. No bluebells seen.
22. No Primula seen (oxlip said to
occur).
23. Mercury widely distributed but
seldom dominant.
24. Rhamnus.
25. Few ancient woodland plants.

        History
  Internal evidence for ancient
woodland is poor. The argument
must rest on the boundaries.
  All the coppice blocks are typo-
logically the same, except Elgins
which has slighter straight banks
and internal pollards.
Boundary with railway.
  The N. boundary of Street
coppice is a nearly straight
bank which does not coincide
5645
with the railway fence but meets
it at s very acute angle. This
narrow gore contains one pollard
oak. Fencing it does not make
sense by itself: the gore must
have been cur off by the railway
from a larger area. Taken
with Chapman & Andre, this
means that the srea between
the coppices and the road was
a laund. C. & A. show [!!!!] park-
land in this area, with buildings
only on the N. side of the road.
  The coppice bank continues
along the railway into Hampton's
Coppice but there stops. The
railway is on an embankment at
this point and probaly took a
small strip from the coppice.
  The existence of a roadside
[5646-5647]
5646
laund implies that the N.E. cop-
pices were defined at a time
when roadside launds were required.
Suggested sequence:
1. Embanking of coppice blocks
(except Elgin).
2. Making of curved or sinuous
internal boundaries (e.g. Hamptons),
which runs through alder area.
3. Making of straight internal
boundaries.
4. Making of 8 WantzWays and
other ride systems.
5. Embanking of Elgin's.
Poverty of ground vegetation due
to secondary woodland, or heavy
grazing at times, or both.

The present N. edge of Bourn
Wood is slightly sinuous.

  Several large tops and bran-
ches have fallen from elms in
the eastern elm grove.
  Flowering of elms is poor in 
general this year and particularly
bad in Hsyley Wood. In the eastern 
grove most of the trees have no
flowers ar all, and only a few of
the older ones have more than a 
few,
  All the ditches in Hayley are
full, and a few of rhe wet
hollows in the coppice plots; but
the ground in general is very 
dry, and none od the black holes
in other areas contains water.
  Pimpinella major is beginning
to show leaves. Last year's old
stems have largely decayed.
There has been light deer
5655
activity in the past few weeks in
several parts of the Wood.
  About one oxlip in 1000 is
in flower.
  Callitriche is stsrting growth

  A biplane was seen flying
very low near rhe Wood. It
just clesred the Triangle, missing
the Coopers' cottage and passed

  Raised areas tend to have blue-

Depressed areas (about 1/3 of

unfenced it was difficult to
find a B000 area. In 1971 un-
fenced the area of oxlips totally

  "Cover" represents estimated cover
of oxlips in the 1-m. radius, as
percentage of ground unencumbered

  Impossible to estimate number
of rosettes or plants because
of large numbers of small rosettes

  The E. half of the Kennet &
Avon canal contains water through

  Main type is pure oak mai-

save Rhododrndron in places.
Ivy frequently growing up trees.
  Ash & sallow frequent as
small constituents; beech nd
sycamore less frequent.
  Birch abundant in places,
and sometimes dominant over
large areas, which may be secondary
either to oak wood or to
furze.
  Holly frequent as single
trees among birch.
