395: probably Quercus pubescens.
A single tree by a field track
on the Plain. About 40ft
high, with a single straight trunk
and rather narrow cylindrical
crown. Q. pubescens was not
seen elsewhere in Crete. This oak
is notably more hairy than
most pubescens in the W. Medi-
terranean. [definitely brachy.]

398. Foeniculum, Psychr[SYMBOL], by
roadside. A flat fasciation with
F. vulga[????] ssp vulg[????]

[11030-11031]

leaves 3-4 side by side at each
node, occupying the full width of
one side of the stem, and alter-
nating from side to side at the
nodes. The umbel arises from
the whole of the top end of the
stem. Pedicels and flowers normal.

Xerocampos bridge.

to have had flowers but fruits
are rare and occur mainly in
dichotomies of the twigs. It ap-
pears to have had leaves at
some other season. Not seen away
from Myrtos. (11/7/68) [SYMBOL]

June 29 (cont. from p. 632)
ROUTE TO ANATOLI
[DIAG]

[11036-11037]

Much of the soft limestone
has cultivation terraces and
other traces of arable and
may have been farmed fairly
recently, although present
cornfields are only a very small
part of the area. Other rocks
are less cultivated.
Short annual grassland
(Stipa &c.) appears to be seral
to arable, at least in some
places.
Pines.
Scattered throughout the area,
mainly on N. facing slopes. The
best are near Anatoli, probably
on Nagelfluh. No old trees seen.
Anatoli.
Village apparently on
soft limestone at the foot of
the main hard limestone out-
crop (Eo[SYMBOL]av[SYMBOL]ou[SYMBOL][SYMBOL]os).
Houses almost all of
one storey with flat roofs,
built closely against one ano-
ther in agglomerations of 1-
celled buildings, so that it is
difficult to separate house from
house or to identify farm
buildings. Streets very narrow with
steps, few motorable, used by
mules. Buildings whitewashed.
Roofs of cement or sometimes
beaten earth. Numerous dried-
-up annuals. Mainly xou[SYMBOL]ou[SYMBOL]as.
At least 3 churches or
chapels, each in a small yard,
mostly concreted. Low featureless

[11038-11039]

buildings with 1-3 parallel bar-
rel vaults. Gable bell-cotes. Vault
and walls cemented over; no
roof.
Gardens few: a few mulberries
and other shade trees in the vil-
lage.
Street plan appears to be
of several very irregular but
roughly rectangular blocks.
The village is surrounded
by a highly-cultivated and fairly
well-defined infield.
Myrtle was seen only in
one place (see map).
Geology.
Most of the area is soft
limestone and marl, with ex-
posures of conglomerate in the
Cephala valley apparently hap-
hazardly. The hills are dissected
by shallow valleys but on a
less formidable scale than in the
coast range.
Hard limestone begins behind
Anatoli.
Basalt occurs as plugs
and sheets. The former com-
prise:
Ma[SYMBOL]a[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL] (two, or perhaps one
split).
Possibly one at 589027.
A [SYMBOL] [SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]as, and possibly another
E. of the town (if [SYMBOL] 22).
Two, possibly more, in the [SYMBOL] o[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]
area (one being Hill 434) (if [SYMBOL] 21).
Several in the K[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL] area

[11040-11041]

(p. 629)
These are all steep-sided
crags.
Sheets of basalt, not form-
ing crags, occur in several places
on the S.E. slopes of the K[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]
area (p. 629, 1034)
Basalt forms harder and
more stable cliffs than soft lime-
stone, but is often overlain by
fertile soil. Cliffs black, often
weathering to red.
No evidence of recent ser-
ious erosion, except round the
base of the K[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL] plug.
Building construction:
At Anatoli mostly soft lime-
stone.
A hut below Anatoli had
a flat roof laid on pine joists.
Principal joist a sizeable trunk
(c. 9 in. dia.), very straight.
Animals.
No stock of any description
seen.
July 1 (cont. from p. 699).
Banana growing. ([SYMBOL] 36, 37)
On a large scale in the A[???]i
pla[!!!!][????] with small areas in the
[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]o[SYMBOL]a and [SYMBOL] [SYMBOL] valleys.
Planted in rows in shallow
trenches to which water was
admitted in spring (cf Myrtos
practice, p. 671). Trees about
6ft high, with up to 4 trunks
c. 2ft high.
Leaves healthy, unaffected by

[11042-11043]

frost, remaining long entire.
Fruit now green and about
6in. long. At the end of the
journey (roughly 435990) I sat
exhausted under a banana tree
and was kindly given some
fresh bananas by banana gather-
ers. Though green they were ex-
cellent, with none of the objectionable
taste of commercial fruit. The
friendly people were interested in
my doings and refilled my empty
water bottle.
Ground kept weed-free.
Cultivated areas.
The desciption of A[????] [SYMBOL]a[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL].
(p. 684) applies to most of
them. Apparent reduction of culti-
vation in the last few years.
No water seen except at
A[SYMBOL] [SYMBOL]a[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]. The [SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]ova valley
is narrow and has a deep dry
gulley of a kind not seen else-
where.
People were seen at T[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL] and
Ka[SYMBOL]o [SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]s; at the latter I
was guided by a friendly A[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL].
Fences of Spartium ([SYMBOL] 36)
Headland Savannahs ([SYMBOL] 35, 4;p. 690)
On level ground on the [SYMBOL][[SYMBOL][SYMBOL]o[SYMBOL] and [SYMBOL]-
[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]o[SYMBOL] and T[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]
[SYMBOL][SYMBOL]a ridges.
See p.
Grassland has a temporary
appearance and much of it
may be secondary. No trace
of cultivation boundaries. Very
flat.
Trees are all carobs, varying
in size, the largest c. 3ft dia.

[11044-11045]

and very gnarled as well as
wind-pruned. They are all
about 20ft high. Apparently
deliberately spaced out. These
include some of the most
venerable carobs seen in Crete.
Soil appears to be thin
over soft limestone.
Carobs are now neglected and
[!!!!] the fruit not gathered. No young
trees.
Olive cultivation.
Olive trees all middle-aged.
No scrub under olives, but
often grassland like that just
mentioned but taller and
with more Ononis. This suggests
that olives were formerly
ploughed under.
Trees now neglected and fruit
often ungathered.
Gorge of Arvi.
Seen from a distance ([SYMBOL] 35)
as a formidable slit in the moun-
tains.
Lycium is characteristic of
the little cultivated plains ([SYMBOl] [!!!!] 2).
July 3 (cont. from p. 730).
Geology & scenery in the Mou[SYMBOL][SYMBOL]its area.
Soft limestone and sandstone
patchy
form ragged hills with low [SYMBOL] scrub,
seldom cultivated unless nearly
level.
Basalt similar but with
more woody vegetation.
Hard limestone has a consider-

[11046-11047]

able variety from Coridothymus heath
to pine forest, depending probably
on slope and history. Cultivated
mainly where level. [SYMBOL] 17,18
Note no terra rossa on hard
limestone: yellowish soil, usually
scanty.
"Volcanic" (probably basalt)
forms good deep soils of loam
texture, even on steep slopes.
Mostly steeply sloping and thus
not arable. Mainly under olives.
[SYMBOL] 16 (view of St Catherine's Chapel)
with threshing floor from near
S[SYMBOL]a[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]a), 21. "Natural" tall scrub.
Schist similar to hard lime-
stone, always steep, rather more soil.
Serpentine occurs in a block
around Mou[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]s, with broad
veins further E. The strata are
nearly vertical and can be
followed as they run roughly
E.N.E. across ridges and valleys.
They have no effect on the geo-
morphology. Serpentine is intercala-
ted with [SYMBOL]ou[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]pas and in one
place there is a bright crimson
vein presumably of haematite.
Serpentine produces a deep clay
([SYMBOL] 23).
[SYMBOL] 22: village & orchards of
Mou[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]s. 24: tall garrigue (p. 728)
on serpentine by the road to
Myrtos; although of very small
extent (a tiny patch in the corner of
a field remains uncultivated) it
is probably the densest scrub in the
area. Note there is hardly any
litter even here.
Small quantities of litter were
