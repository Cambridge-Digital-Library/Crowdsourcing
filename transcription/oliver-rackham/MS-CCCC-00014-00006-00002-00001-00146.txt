A single tree by a field track
on the Plain. About 40ft
high, with a single straight trunk
and rather narrow cylindrical
crown. Q. pubescens was not
seen elsewhere in Crete. This oak
is notably more hairy than
most pubescens in the W. Medi-
terranean. [definitely brachy.]

roadside. A flat fasciation with
F. vulga[????] ssp vulg[????]

[11030-11031]

leaves 3-4 side by side at each
node, occupying the full width of
one side of the stem, and alter-
nating from side to side at the
nodes. The umbel arises from
the whole of the top end of the
stem. Pedicels and flowers normal.

[11032-11033]

dig hill. An entirely leafless shrub,
with 2-3 flowers each day in
the early morning on the ends
of twigs. Most of the twigs appear
to have had flowers but fruits
are rare and occur mainly in
dichotomies of the twigs. It ap-
pears to have had leaves at
some other season. Not seen away
from Myrtos. (11/7/68) [SYMBOL]

vegetation of Xerocampos.
416: Bromus sp., abandoned
arable on massif behind dig
hill. intermedius
417: Echium, Xerocampos. angustifolium

June 29 (cont. from p. 632)
ROUTE TO ANATOLI
[DIAG]

[11036-11037]

Much of the soft limestone
has cultivation terraces and
other traces of arable and
may have been farmed fairly
recently, although present
cornfields are only a very small
part of the area. Other rocks
are less cultivated.
Short annual grassland
(Stipa &c.) appears to be seral
to arable, at least in some
places.
Pines.
Scattered throughout the area,
mainly on N. facing slopes. The
best are near Anatoli, probably
on Nagelfluh. No old trees seen.
Anatoli.
Village apparently on
soft limestone at the foot of
the main hard limestone out-
crop (Eo[SYMBOL]av[SYMBOL]ou[SYMBOL][SYMBOL]os).
Houses almost all of
one storey with flat roofs,
built closely against one ano-
ther in agglomerations of 1-
celled buildings, so that it is
difficult to separate house from
house or to identify farm
buildings. Streets very narrow with
steps, few motorable, used by
mules. Buildings whitewashed.
Roofs of cement or sometimes
beaten earth. Numerous dried-
-up annuals. Mainly xou[SYMBOL]ou[SYMBOL]as.
At least 3 churches or
chapels, each in a small yard,
mostly concreted. Low featureless

[11038-11039]

buildings with 1-3 parallel bar-
rel vaults. Gable bell-cotes. Vault
and walls cemented over; no
roof.
Gardens few: a few mulberries
and other shade trees in the vil-
lage.
Street plan appears to be
of several very irregular but
roughly rectangular blocks.
The village is surrounded
by a highly-cultivated and fairly
well-defined infield.
Myrtle was seen only in
one place (see map).
Geology.
Most of the area is soft
limestone and marl, with ex-
posures of conglomerate in the
Cephala valley apparently hap-
hazardly. The hills are dissected
by shallow valleys but on a
less formidable scale than in the
coast range.
Hard limestone begins behind
Anatoli.
Basalt occurs as plugs
and sheets. The former com-
prise:
Ma[SYMBOL]a[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL] (two, or perhaps one
split).
Possibly one at 589027.
A [SYMBOL] [SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]as, and possibly another
E. of the town (if [SYMBOL] 22).
Two, possibly more, in the [SYMBOL] o[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]
area (one being Hill 434) (if [SYMBOL] 21).
Several in the K[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL] area

[11040-11041]

(p. 629)
These are all steep-sided
crags.
Sheets of basalt, not form-
ing crags, occur in several places
on the S.E. slopes of the K[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]
area (p. 629, 1034)
Basalt forms harder and
more stable cliffs than soft lime-
stone, but is often overlain by
fertile soil. Cliffs black, often
weathering to red.
No evidence of recent ser-
ious erosion, except round the
base of the K[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL] plug.
Building construction:
At Anatoli mostly soft lime-
stone.
A hut below Anatoli had
a flat roof laid on pine joists.
Principal joist a sizeable trunk
(c. 9 in. dia.), very straight.
Animals.
No stock of any description
seen.
July 1 (cont. from p. 699).
Banana growing. ([SYMBOL] 36, 37)
On a large scale in the A[???]i
pla[!!!!][????] with small areas in the
[SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL][SYMBOL]o[SYMBOL]a and [SYMBOL] [SYMBOL] valleys.
Planted in rows in shallow
trenches to which water was
admitted in spring (cf Myrtos
practice, p. 671). Trees about
6ft high, with up to 4 trunks
c. 2ft high.
Leaves healthy, unaffected by
