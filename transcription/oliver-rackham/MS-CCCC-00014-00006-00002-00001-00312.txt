About 6 ft hign, v]but gfelxible &
not esvaping. Flavlur very sweet
followed by astringent. In bad
condition thro' browsing.

Much of the plateau seems to
have recovered from bulldozing.

Maple occ. in N. side - just as
palatable as oak, but (like Phil-
lyrea) grows more easily into tree.

(D) Dense M with a little G
Rather tall, not much grazed,
Mainly prickly-oak.
Arbutus ab.
[4234-4235]
4234
Cotinus freq. Strongly resinous
taste - very little eaten. Grows
slowly and stops at 5-6 ft
high. Pine invasive.
Colutea rare, rather weak.

   Lower part of hill is schist
(usually covered with schistose
fill). Upper part is hard lime-
stone (often massive).  The
schist vegetation continues a little
into the limestone - the boundary
is not sharp, and occasional
Arbutus goes right up to the top.
Phillyrea mainly on the 
limestone.
   Some terewinth on schist.
   Lentisk only near (A), on
S.W.-facing slope at 720 m -
evidently its upper limit.
4235
   Olive & oleaster thinly scat-
tered through M up to 800 m.
- evidently relics of cultivation.

E) cultivated zone (olives &c)
with freq decid. oaks ss hedge &
field trees - to c. 30 ft high &
1 ft thick.  Hill is of schist,
with vegetation much as at (D).

   Grazing evidently still occurs 
in winter. There is a [SYMBOL]
newly built near (D).

() Arbutus - Erica macchia,
quite dense with very little G,
much prickly-oak. Invaded
by decid, oaks, whidh are
smallish and evidently on the
increaae - much as in the N.W.

Whiter Mts

(G) dense Arbutus - erica -
Q cocc. macchia with occ
Q. brachy. Frew terebinth.
Cotinus, occ Cercis. One 
possible (but unlikely) Q. ilex
high on mountain.
(H) Phillyrea. Several big field
trees, to c. 30 ft high and 2 ft
thick. Dense, dompact, rounded
crowns. Also some big Qc.
Decid oaks continue and in 
places form small woods
much as in  W. Crete. These
are mostly on Older Fill, on
steep slopes & ravines in gener-
ally cultivsted terrain.
4237
[SYMBOL][SYMBOL]. In
middle of village a hedge of
Qb, long overgrown and now
quite big trees, but gnarled at
base. On waste slopes nearby a
young wood of Qb.
Note no Qm in the area.

Around Kalyvia Theologou are
mulberry orchards of pollards,
cut every yesr, prob. only for
fodder for beasts. Largest pol-
lards rather gnarled, c. 2 ft
dia. probably relics of silk-
growing.

[SYMBOL][SYMBOL]
In middle of village by church
is a huge plne, perhaps a
pollard at 2 fdifferent heights,
[4238-4239]
4238
trunk c. 6 fy dia., huge spread,
rather narrow leaves. Stands
on a terraceor platform; an
arch under the base may be
for a dried-up spring.

Fire. No recently burnt areas
seen except about 1/2 acres of
hilltop near Kalyvia Thwlogou.
Pines about 15 ft high, thinly
scattered, putting om at least
1 ft a year. Possibly derived
from pine-grove on top of hill
[SYMBOL].
   The hill [SYMBOL] has been
extensively bulldozed & planted
with pines.
