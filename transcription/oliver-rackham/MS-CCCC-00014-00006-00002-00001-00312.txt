Colutea rare, rather weak.

   Lower part of hill is schist

Arbutus goes right up to the top.

Limekilns. 3 pairs in the area

perhaps there is hard limestone not
far beneath the surface. Kilns 
are in pairs. Each is a tower of
rubble masonry, about 20 ft high x
15 ft dia., with a large stokehole.
The interior glows yellow-hot. No
particular smoke. There is a tin
roof over the entrance.
   Fuel is a brown powder, prob.
lignite.

Much eroded into cliffs & gullies
but no active erosion.
   Macchia dense and near-con-
tinuous , mod. grazed. Oak-Lentiste
Gariga is mainly Cistus. Some
terebinth & Arbutus.
[SYMBOL]. Larger mponastery
built in 4 ranges round a courtyard
with central church. Outlyng
chapel to the E. in Byzantine style
but with a high central drum.
It has an iconostasis incorporating
bits of ancient work (?17th cent)
in a rude style. Frieze ?of
cypress, has a procession of animals
[4248-4249]
4247
including a vulture clutching a
tortoise.

Chrysapha. Steep village at
spring-line (base of hard lime-
stone, but geology locally very
variable).
         [DIAG]
Church of St Nicholas, on
highest point of Chrysapha. Orig.
building has rather elongated
cruciform plan. Completely covered
inside in frecoes, in bad con-
dition, black with soot & almost
indecipherable. Walls of rubble
[4248-4249]
4248
incorporating a good deal of
thin brick.        [DIAG]
Arches are
segmental, of
specially
shaped thin brick voussoirs.
Many lintels and tie-beams
to all the arches. only one tie-
bm survives and it looks
like a replacement. A, the orig.
entrance-door has blackened
& cracked lintel-besms; this
is said by the old woman woth
the keys to be the work of a
Turkish fire, and indeed the
blackened interior & rruncated
(?charred) stumps of tiebeams
may bear this out.
   Blocked window B has a 
rotten but not charred lintel.
4249
The W. bays are certainly an
addition. Paintings in a later
style, less blackened, better con-
dition. Tiebeams present.
Said to be 1641 (Blue Guide)

Also a tower-house.

[SYMBOL] to Agrinoi. Road
zigzags up to 600 m and then
winds over the undulations of
[SYMBOL] to the valley between
[SYMBOL] and [SYMBOL].
   Distribution of woods much as on
1:50 000 map. Both  mts have
woods right to top (1170-1200m)
but only on the N. side; scattered
trees only, at higher altitudes,
on other aspects.
   Woods clearly expanding. The
[4250-4251]
4250
example studied, at the W. end
of [SYMBOL], is typical of all the N.
side of that mountain. There are
no old trees below at least 950 m.
The coniferous woods have
expanded downwards, into Ar-
butus-Querc. cocc. macchia.
Woods have formed by invasion,
not by growing-up. Pines
seem to invade by rapid growth.
they greatly predominate; Abies
less common. Not seen how
abies survives its earlier years.
N.B. described in Philippson as
Kermeseichen-gebrisch.

Agrianoi. Similar invasion of
woods on E. end of [SYMBOL]
By thevillage fountain is
OSTRYA on a small cliff of
4251
soft metamorphic above the
spring. Ostrya grows as a
single big stool or a row of
stools, overhanging the edge of
the cliff. About 6 ft high. Prob.
recently coppiced, no fruit seen
(but catkins collected). Bark
brown.
At N. end of village is a steep
E-facing slope wirh numerous
fairly fresh erosion gulleys, some
healed, a few still active. Vege-
tation is gariga, with sattered
black pines invading. Eerosion
may have been set of by making
a road higher up the slope, but
this is probably too old. Rock
of soft metamorphic mudstones,
very crumbly, weeps of water 
in places,
[4252-4253]
4252
S-fscing slope opposite (W.
side of [SYMBOL]) has
small cliffs of hard conglomerate.
Biggish Q. cocc. trees on steep
slope; Qc. bushes overhang top
of cliff. Out of cliff (S. fscing)
[!!!!project] grow plants of Stachys
chrysantha. Also Putoria.

Stachys chrysanthe. S. facing
conglomerate cliffs [SYMBOL]

yet scattered trees.
My. [SYMBOL] has fir woods
[4254-4255]
4254
descending to 930 m on its W.
side. Lower woods are also recent
invasion of macchia. No pines.
Woods [SYMBOL] to [SYMBOL]
   Two valleys meeting at the pass
[SYMBOL] (950 m.)
   Woods of pine almost sll
the way. Begins aa wholly P.
nigra. Changes to P. halepensis
on [SYMBOL] side. highest
halepensis not determined. lowest
nigra c. 770 m. Woods end c.
750 m.
Woods are on N.E.-facing slopes
and appear to be mostly secondary
by invasion. Only a few old
pines, which are of spreading
habit and gnarled. Many 
youngish pines (c, 1 ft dia.)
4255
which are straight (tho' sometimes
forked at base) and thickets of
saplings.
Some of the woods are on old
terraces.
   All the old and older pines
(down to to c. 9" dia.) of both spp.
have been resined. Single scsr (on
2 big pines) about 4" wide and
4 ft long. Not recently worked, save
for a few pines nearest [SYMBOL].
Scars about 1/2 closed by rolls
of callus. There must have been
an enormpus resin trade.
   The opposite slope is the
S.W. side of Mt [SYMBOL].
Ridges between deep ravines.
Appears to be all P. halepensis,
quite well established, may
contain old trees (rounded crowns).
[4256-4257]
4256
No stumps seen in any of
these woods.
Tree-trunks of both pines
are often blackened, but this
may be by Phomopsis? rather 
than fire.
[SYMBOL]. Small Byzantine?
church of unusual plan -
square with apse, almost as high
as wide. Decorative brick
patterns and brick arches (cf
Brixworth). Has a clerestory,
below which is a continu-
ous row of square niches (too big
for beams).
[SYMBOL]. A cirque-like
basin in the mountains. Sone
limestone cliffs. Appears wholly
4257
wooded.
A fire-break clearing runs
along the ridge of [SYMBOL].

Below [SYMBOL]
Long road (preparatioins for
making it a tarred road)
descends gently to the main road
near [SYMBOL].
   Much cultivstion, esp. arable,
in little plains.
All the hills are covered in
macchia. Not very arid - only
a little G., and hence unfamiliarly
green for the time of yer. Mostly
low (c. 3 ft), mod. grazed. Appears
very impoverished in species - large
tracts with only Qc. or some
Phillyrea.
Woods only on N. and N.E. slopes

Very arid - very litle M, but
much G and steppe. For much

   Fine riverine woods of plane

4261
   A hot sticky day, misty and
with poor views. Great storm
on Taygetus, with lightning.
Rain in mid-aftenoon (Agricuri
to near Zaraphon). Very heavy
rain at times. hence woods
poorly visible. Forms temporary
pools in places.

Cliffs. Conglomerates alter-
nate with marls & sands - trans-
itions often abrupt. Strange
cliffs up to 300 ft high. Other
slopes are naturally stepped and 
simulate terraces where banks
of conglom. stand out.
Little cliff vegetation, save 
for occasional biggish prickly-oax
on ledges. Cliffs may be too
recent or too unstable?

  The  E. end slopes down

here been carried away by a

the two (both Mycenean) phases
of building.

Shrine of Helen & Menelaois.
Helen was divine in Sparta
[4264-4265]
4264
The top of the 3rd hill is
of hard congomerate and in early
classical times was adapted
into a kind of stepped pyra-
mid with a ramp up to an
altar on the summit.  Huge
blox of hard conglomerate, up 
to 7 ft long, dressed at their
outer edges so thst s knife
cannot be passed between them.
Thw other two hills have
remains of Mycenean building
(first & highest hill) and
a chapel of te Prophet Elias
(4th hill).

Conglomerate Hills. Visible from
the Palace.  Wild ravines 
dissect the hills with many small
4265
cliffs. Steep slopes have
macchia, with woods (Qc?) in
