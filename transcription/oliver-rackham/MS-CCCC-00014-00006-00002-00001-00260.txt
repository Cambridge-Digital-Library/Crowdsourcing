Much Clematis.
These o[!!!!]bservations were
on the way up to the Ossuaire
from the W. The spruce and
pine are typical of the artificial
part of the Forest. It was held
that the mixing-up of the soil
by wartime activities required
"improvement" by conifers as a
preliminary to the planting of
beech, which [????] is now be-
ginning.

[20092-20093]

the houses are marked but no[!!!!]thing
is visible save a few loose stones.
The area is densely planted with
spruce. The elm described has
come up sparsely with the spruce
over most of the area of the
village. About 10[SYMBOL] dead of DED.

[20096-20097]

One stub of elm, c. 1 1/2 ft dia.,
may survive from before the
destruction, as may three hy-
brid limes on the site of the
Place de la Mairie.
DEFG is a large area left
"in its original state" at the
request of the veterans' organ-
ization. Much of it, esp. the
area EF, has little tree growth
after 69 years; it looks rather
like Philip Lloyd's field at Pulpit
Hill. Mainly dogwood and
hawthorn, both about 10ft high,
very slow-growing and prob.
limited by drought. Coarse
tussocky grassland of Brachy-
podium. Gentiana amarella
and germanica loc. ab. Juni-
per v. local, in area E.
D is wel-developed woodland
containing pre-war stools. G is
patchy woodland and scrub with
local ash, birch, sallow, also Comus
and hawthorn. This extends to
the road at [SYMBOL]H[SYMBOL], in which neigh-
bourhood there are patches of
Phragmites.
The W. part of the site is
evidently wetter than the E.,
although the ground is higher
(indeed the high[!!!!] point, at B,
is a reedbed). As far as can
be seen the wetter part is some-
what clayey, while the drier has
little but limestone. The wetter
areas are more readily colonized
by trees.
Although said to have been
left in its original state, the area

[20098-20099]

has probably been coppiced at
least twice, as shown by the
ash.
Oaks are numerous and
flourishing in areas C and to
a lesser extent H. No big [????]
seen for many miles.
Around Fleury the planted
trees, [!!!!] are Picea, Pinus austriaca,
Alnus incana. Some of the
last are coppice stools with a
suckering tendency. There is
a steep sloe down to the N.W.
but the terrain is very wet,
with standing water in many
of the craters. Several stools
of alder, including some prob-
ably pre-war.
Nettles frequent in this
slope in the neighbourhood of the
deserted village.
All these areas, and miles
around, are covered with overlapping
craters (15-)30(-45)ft dia.
Lorraine villages.
Irregular plans, but usually
strung out along a road.
Houses terraced, with wide
roofs parallel to the road. There
is usually a broad space between
the caniveau and the house in
which vehicles are parked and
wood stored.
Roman tiles are usual from
Lagney to Verdun; all of the
[DIAG] type. Also in Verdun itself.
Occasionally they are new.
On the return journey via

[20100-20101]

Thiaucourt and Pont-[SYMBOL]-Mousson
such tiles are rare, partly because
of war damage. Several villages
seem to have been almost com-
pletely rebuilt.
Firewood. The usual billet is
about 4ft long (sometimes double
this length) x 7"; often half or
1/4 log.
The cuesta landscape is
repeated in many places along
the route to Verdun. Clay
vales with mostly smallish horn-
beam woods and permanent
scarps
grass; [!!!!]slopes[!!!!] of orchards, vineyards,
and scrub & secondary woodland;
"improved" beech forets on the
upper slopes and plateaux.
Cynanchum vincetoxicum.
Occ. in very dry chalk slopes.
Foret de Sommedieue (N.).
Mostly pure beech.
[!!!!]Partly hb u/w - one part
just coppiced with oak stds
& a few beech. (c. 2ac.) Near Fort
du Rozelier.
Much R-F in the plain
just before Marcheville, &
between there & St Hilaire en
Woevre. (F. planche).
Woel. Ancient church, timer-
-framed top to tower.
Trench through woods both
before & after Woel. Much
the same as that through the
For[SYMBOL]t de Haye. [????] no woodbank.

[20102-20103]

Elms. Doncourt aux Tepli-
ers - 60[SYMBOL]
After Woel: grove of elms,
suckering, unaffected.
Fey-en-Haye: many small
clumps of Uc, 8[SYMBOL]
Near Loisy 50[SYMBOL]
Buissi[SYMBOL]res c. 10[SYMBOL]
Most deaths of elms in Lor-
raine are this year's.
Mostly beech but some
oak.
The Wo[SYMBOL]vre landscape is
very different from that a few
miles W.: a disected plateau,
with reddish limestone soils having
loose limestone fragments - much
as on the Cotswold plateau.
Thiaucourt. Much irregular
[????] woodland, becoming dominated
by ash.
Foret de Front de Haye. Some
hornbeam u/w in detached
wood to N.W.
The main Forest, some miles w.
of Pont-[SYMBOL]-Mousson, was established
after WWI on severely-cratered
land. Planted species [!!!!]are[!!!!] Pinus
nigra and Picea. Much natural
regrowth, at least round edges.
Pont-[SYMBOL]-Mousson. Ancient town,
the seat of a medieval university.
Fine medieval church and fine
baroque church.
The square is lined with
stone-built houses, mostly 15th
