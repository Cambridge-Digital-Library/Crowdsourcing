Hayley acorns have a
nutty flavour with very astrin-
gent after-taste.

[12684-12685]
2684
October 24
Buff Wood  (D.E.C.)
  Most leaves have fallen
from the mature hornbeams.
  A long search (about an
hour) by the two of us
produced 5 acorns.  There
are large quantities of
fallen cups, some very large,
under most of the trees
(though a minority have
few or none).  Shells are
very few, there are a few 
nibbled or otherwise damaged
acorns.  The crop was evi-
dently a good one but almost
the whole have been swallowed
whole or taken away and 
hidden.
2665
Primrose leaves are still
visible.
  The ground is dry in
most of the wood with cracks
up to 1 1/2in wide.  The S.E.
ride is still wet and muddy
in places.  Ground still damp
in  the Helleborus area;  the
pond is nearly empty and
much reduced in area.
  Mercury has wilted in
the oxlip and primrose 
areas: in places with dense
mercury the ground is
moister and most of the
mercury is still turgid (cf
Hayley).
  Hellebrous is not wilted
though the leaves are now

[12686-12687]
2686
yellowing.
  No acorns could be
found down cracks.
On the S.E. ride, a thick
grass-green filamentous alga
encrusts to the harder ridges
in the mud.
  The Serratula plant has
set seed.

A hedgehog was seen run-
ning at about 4 m.p.h. across the 
grass at Littlehampton in the 
moonlight.  When surprised it
stopped but was not immediately
inclined to roll into a ball, and 
soon went away.

  The large apple tree in the
back hedge has an immense
crop.
  The tortoise is still fairly
active.
  The artichokes are 7 ft
high but show no sign of
flowering.
  There is no evidence of 
frost.
October 30.
  A considerable proportion 
of the Hayley Wood acorns -
stored in a half-tub out of
doors - are germinating.  The
style-remains split and the
radicle emerges and turns
downside.
October 31
2689
  100 Hayley acorns which
had germinated were potted
in Jophn Innes in plastic pots,
by Wm Palmer.
November 1
Hayley Wood (Historical Ecology
Group).
  2 young oaks were found
by Donald Pigott at the S.
end of the Triangle.
  The party was taken along
"Hayley Ditch" into the glade
and out by the coppice plots.

Hardwick Wood (H.E.G.)
  The party was taken in at
the S.W., corner, through the
R.& F. areas on the W. side,
back down the E. side, and
[12690-12691]
2690
out at the S.E. corner.
  Mercury is now very largely
dead.

Buff Wood (H.E.G.)
  The party was taken through
East Hatley.  Many members
were surprised and amused
by the street of [????moats] in
East Hatley.
  We entered the wood by 
the S.E. gate and went as
far as the old wood.
2691
November 2.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).
  Over half the coppice was 
completed today.
  A large bonfire lit under
a sizeable oak near the S.
corner of the plot caused much
trouble.  A mouldering snag
some 20 ft high started smoul-
dering.  The fire was allowed
to die down but it continued
to burn and was fanned by
the wind into flame.  Another
dead branch also started to
burn.  The fire was put
out with great difficulty by 
bringing water from the pond
and heaping earth on it, but
one of the snags continued to

[12692-12693]
2692
burn indefinitely until scraped
with a pole.
The combustion evidently
began with quite a modest rise
in temperature, the fire not being 
fierce and flames never reach-
ing anything like the height of
the snags.  The material
burning was the rotten sap-wood
at the base of dead branches
adjoining the living sap-wood
of the main branch.
There was no evidence
of damage to the teee or
threat of a larger conflagration.
2693
November 8.
  Felsham Hall Wood (S.M. Walters,
J. Dickson, W.H. Palmer. Father Lothian,
John Hedger, Joan Dunkley, Dr Watt
and students, total 23).

d. Cirriphyllum piliferium.  Bases
of stools (J. Dickson).

  The elm coppice in FHW is
apparently a hybrid U. procera
x glabra;  none definitely with 
3 tips;  no suckers.
  Phragmites on the cottage
site has about 6 infls.
  The Calamagrostis near the 
cottage site and westwards along
the main ride appears to be

[12694-12695]
2694
all canescens (SMW).  It forms
dense stands which have now
lodged except where trapped
in young trees.
  In the two bracken glades
in the middle of FHW, the bracken
has all died and collapsed 
except where caught up in 
trees.  Two fronds so caught
and still green measured 12'01/2"
and 12'81/2" long.
  There are several hummocks
and hollows in the S. of these 
glades.
  To the W. of the N. of the 
glades, there are two free-stan-
ding bushes of Frangula, each
about 8ft high, rounded in
outline.  Branches with bark
[Dr Watt said he had never seen
any so large.]
2695
with short longitudinal fissures.
Frangula was seen in several
other places.
  The "fish pond" is quite dry
and contains much Lycopus in
the bottom.
  By the "fish pond" were
seen two stumps about 1ft
dia. apparently of Pinus syl-
vestris, though too decayed
for certain identification.  They
had apparently had big low
branches.  A trunk was found
mouldering in the bottom of
the "pond".
  Lysimachia nummularia
was found in the bottom of
the "pond" to the FHW side (SMW).
Succisa still flowers in

[12696-12697]
2696
the S. side.
  A single small plant of
ivy, about 1 1/2 ft long, was found
by the 359o ditch in the
middle S.E. compartment of FHW.
  This ditch is about 1 1/2 ft
deep, the upcast changing
from side to side.  It appears
to be similar to that in the
E. compartment, and probably
for drainage.
  Numerous acorns are 
still about.
  The main ride is still
fairly soft.
  Most of the Prunus in
the wood is reasonably homo-
geneous, but a bush resembling 
cerasifera (green, glabrous, shiny
2697
twigs, gray in the 2nd year)
and one resembling insititia
(thorny, twigs densely pubes-
cent, by now brown) were found.
P. spinosa by now has brown
or gray twigs.
  Several elder bushes by the
ditches of the E. part of Main
Ride have died, apparently thro'
flooding.
  Silaum silaus is common
on the S. ride.
Ribes rubrum occurs by
the 259o ditch.
  A large crab tree was seen 
on the S. boundary.
  Vicia tetrasperma:  small qty
on main ride.

[12698-12699]

November 9.
  About 60 more acorns from
Hayley which had begun germinating
were potted up (tar-paper pots,
John Innes no. 1) making a total
of about 160.
November 15.
2699
     Pigeons are
     very numer-
     ous in Ely 
     Cathedral
     and several
     dead birds
     were found
     in the Octa-
     gon.
       The gourds
     continue to 
     flourish, but 
 only very small fruit have been
 produced.
 November 16.
 Hayley Wood (coppicing & pond
 making.
 Coppicing was almost finished
 today.
 
 [12700-12701]
 2700
   The bottom of "Hayley Ditch
 Ride" being largely dry, work con-
 tinued on excavating the new pond.
 The dam was formed from
 the material dug out from
 an area about 0 - 8 ft above, in 
 section thus:
 
   [DIAG]
   
  The bottom of the 
ditch contained about
2 in of leaf mould.  Below
this was some 9 in. of apparently
in situ clay, under which ex-
cavation was stopped by a 
gravel pavement.
2701
November 17.
  No gourds of any size 
have been produced.
  The Passiflora has not
flowered this year.

Features of interest.
1.  Boundary banks nearly
complete, moderately strong,
submarginal on parts of the E.
and S. sides.
2. Moat with traces of a 
"bailey" bank and an over-
flow ditch, apparently no
associated earthworks.
3.  No other earthworks except
ride ditches (some of which
may have been obliterated by

[12720-12721]

concrete road building).
4. Soil entirely of the light 
type, more acid in places than
parts of MPW.
5.  Woodland structure of 
LC and poles over large areas.
6. Dominated (except in the
N.E.) by Tilia cordata.  This
consists almost entirely of
once-cuts & small stools.  Oc-
casional big stools.  Very large
limes in the wood at A 
(huge double-trunked tree, ap-
parently not a pollard) and
exceptionally large boundary
pollards:  also a big standard
lime on the N.E. side.  No ef-
fective lime regeneration.
7. Oak sparse and stumps few.
2721
8. Ash extremely rare:  only
in small areas of N.E., S.E. and S.W.
and there only small trees. Not
one stool seen.  Prob. marginal only.
9. Maple very rare.
10. Birch abundant, prob. all
pubescens.
11. Hazel mostly sparse.
12. Poplars rare, only in very acid area.
13. Holly rare.
14. Hawthorn rare, all mono.
15. No elm.
16. Wet podsolized area.
17 Many calcifuges:
  Teucnium aboundant
  Bracken over about half
the wood, up to c. 3 ft high
  Foxglove loc. ab.
  Molionia: about 6 tussocks

[12722-12723]
2722
in wet very acid podsolized
soils, very chlorotic
  oxalis loc. ab.
  Rhododendron rare but
  flourishing
  Stellaria graminea Broom
18. Rare:
   cirsium palustre (despite
   water logging)
   Carex sylvatica
   Heracleum
   
19. Prunus laurocerasus: one
group, conceivably native.
20. Possible secondary wood-
land E. of the moat, wood-
land structure rather dif-
ferent with less lime, but
2723
not sharply defined nor ditch-
-bounded.
21. Cherry (apparently only 
one tree).

  This appears to be an
ancient wood, the evidence 
being:
1. Sinuous boundary.
2. Boundary bank.
3. Absence of internal field earth-
works.
4. Lime present in wood &
nearby hedge, including old trees.
5. Old pollards.
6. Other rare trees such as
cherry.
  The evidence is not as
strong as for other primary
[2724 - 2725]
2724
woods.
  Suggested woodland man-
agement:
Stage 1. Mixed wood with much
less lime than now (lime
very local in hedge although
other parts of hedge are mixed).
Stage 2. Mid-19th cent. Lime
encouraged; old woodland
structure destroyed, except for
boundary pollards and possibly 
occasional lime stools.
Stage 3. Mid to late 19th cent.
Small clearings made and
Douglas, oak, chestnut, larch,
scots, sycamore planted.  Rhodo-
dendron & Thuja possibly from
this period.
Stage 4. 1920s wood probab
2725
clear felled, and few remaining
oak standards removed.
Lime regenerated from stools
(which may have been cut
once before).  Plantations not
touched.
Stage 5. 2nd War.  Concrete
roads made: probably little
felling.
Stage 6. From 1960. Felling and
planting  with numerous exotics.
  Mercury occurs in the 
E. hedge and sometimes the W.
from the A47 to the wood,
suggesting a former wood 
outline.
  The area N.E. of the moat 
is very heath-like and possble
2ndary wood, but the boundary
is not clear.


[12726-12727]
[DIAG]

Pollard trees &c.

to East Tuddenham.
A - decayed hollow pollard with

No mercury or lime in any

[12728-12729]
2728
  Most of the hedges between
the A47 & E. Tuddenham
appear to be quite recent,
chiefly hawthorn & blackthorn.
The exception is on the S. side 
going down to the Tud Beck 
where there is an "ancient"

           [radiata]
 Phlebia merismarides on
 living oak. Oak with 3 trunks
 near the Tetraphis stump.
 One trunk - suppressed but
 living c. 8 in. dia, is covered
 with Phlebia for about 40%
 of one side along a 2 ft length.
 Fungus brilliant orange,
 middle of thalli darker and
 purplish surface very wrinkled
with irregular ridges, cheesy
in texture.  Margin with furry
filamentous processes exten-
ding horizontally over bark.

  The Cam is thinly frozen
from bank to bank between 
King's & Clare bridge, and by
Sheep's Green.  The King's Mill
pool at Newnham and the 
stream from Fen Causeway thereto
are frozen thick enough to bear
a duck.
  Ducks on ice waddle like
Donald Duck, their feet slipping 
from side to side, usually
outwardss.  They remain stan-
ding when going slowly but
2735
often belly-land if they hurry.
When landing from flight onto
ice, they skate for several
yards before stopping.  They
were squabbling among them-
selves, both partners usually
falling over.  Much trouble
was given by a hard and
slippery piece of frozen bread
too thick to swallow and
just too heavy to fly away
with. Two females were rolling
over the ice while quarrelling
while a drake stood uncon-
cernedly by.
  Roads passable with 4-
wheel drive or chains:  little
drifting.

  Collybia velutipes occurs
on a sycamore stump in the
garden.
  One of the apple trees in
the bottom hedge still bears
quantities of apples, which are
2741
much attacked by starlings.
A net bag of nuts has
been hung from the trellis out-
side the kitchen window and is
much visited by tits.  One
sparrow also visits the bag 
and hangs on its sides or
bottom in the same way as the
tits, steadied by its tail
pressed down at right angles 
against the bag.  It lands on 
a branch of the rose and hops
onto a perch on the nearby
bag.

heard fairly often around Fan-
shawe.
  Acorns planted in pots
appear not to have made any
root growth since setting out.
