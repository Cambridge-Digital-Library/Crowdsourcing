Commin rafters
which use c. 7x?4, flat laid,
c. 15ft long.  Tree dia. much
[SYMBOL] diagonal, but trees very
crooked, and thus arises partly
waney.  Not tapering.  Knots
frequent, large, average c. 45o.
One rafter has knots of
c. 45o, about 3 ft from

[12674-12675]
2674
the top & bottom ends.
Nave Roof.  Clumsy & inaccurate
Victorian reconstruction of single
framed roof with collars, collar
braces, collar purlins and 2
tie beams with crown posts &
4-way struts.

Bench ends.  Few poppy heads
survive, attached to later ends.

Screen-work.  Fragments may
survive in communion rails &
commandment board frames.
2675
Bradfield St George Church
Nave Roof.  Very like Great
St Mary's but
without bosses.
Corbel
details       [DIAG]
suggest
late 16th
or even
17th cent.
Clerestorey has Perp windows,
deep weathering in tower wall
indicates a lower clerestorey or
none.  Timbers very heavy.
Principal rafters about 12x12,
very steeply cambered.  There 
are 7 trusses, each apparently
of a single tree with a
natural bend.  Deeply moulded

[12676-12677]
2676
Purlins & ridge about 10x8, flat
laid, deeply moulded
Common rafters about
6x5 [DIAG]
All timbers are from fairly
crooked trees.  Knots many small,
often grouped, probably at wide
angles.
Braces large, carven with
?dragons.
This roof wants closer inves-
tigation.
North Aisle Roof.  Similar, appar-
ently the same period, less
ornate, smaller scantling.

Benches.  About a dozen medie-
val ones, with poppy heads and
2677
in one case a winged bear.
Ends are up to 18in. wide,
apparently all heartwood.
Tree of the order of 100
years old. Fast grown;  rings
up to 1/4" wide, seldom less
than 2mm.  Few knots.

Jacobean Pulpit.

 Felsham Hall Wood.
 Plantago major.  In front
of Nissen hut is a plant
with the infls replaced by a
globular head of hundreds
of small opathulate leaves.
The same plant has normal
infls.

1969 Coppice growth
overripe herbs
Little increase in herbs so
far.  mainly Filip & Desch

Bracken frequent along
the N. side up to and in-
cluding the NW handle.
Leaf fall in ash is somewhat
later than in Norfolk.
Acorns are abundant
under some of the oaks in
this wood.
Most of the Agrimonia
along the rides is A. odorata

  Acorns much less abundant.
  Young oaks numerous in
3-10-year-old coppice but often
cut with the coppice.
  The main ride has again
been ploughed by Mr Knox.

Marasmius androsacens.  Several
on birch twigs, middle N. section.

Ditch, rather massive, found
in middle N. section.

Little increase in herbs, few
ruderals.   
Much Luzula pilosa and
Agrostis stilonifera, the latter

October 23.
Hayley acorns have a
nutty flavour with very astrin-
gent after-taste.

[12684-12685]
2684
October 24
Buff Wood  (D.E.C.)
  Most leaves have fallen
from the mature hornbeams.
  A long search (about an
hour) by the two of us
produced 5 acorns.  There
are large quantities of
fallen cups, some very large,
under most of the trees
(though a minority have
few or none).  Shells are
very few, there are a few 
nibbled or otherwise damaged
acorns.  The crop was evi-
dently a good one but almost
the whole have been swallowed
whole or taken away and 
hidden.
2665
Primrose leaves are still
visible.
  The ground is dry in
most of the wood with cracks
up to 1 1/2in wide.  The S.E.
ride is still wet and muddy
in places.  Ground still damp
in  the Helleborus area;  the
pond is nearly empty and
much reduced in area.
  Mercury has wilted in
the oxlip and primrose 
areas: in places with dense
mercury the ground is
moister and most of the
mercury is still turgid (cf
Hayley).
  Hellebrous is not wilted
though the leaves are now

[12686-12687]
2686
yellowing.
  No acorns could be
found down cracks.
On the S.E. ride, a thick
grass-green filamentous alga
encrusts to the harder ridges
in the mud.
  The Serratula plant has
set seed.

A hedgehog was seen run-
ning at about 4 m.p.h. across the 
grass at Littlehampton in the 
moonlight.  When surprised it
stopped but was not immediately
inclined to roll into a ball, and 
soon went away.

  The large apple tree in the
back hedge has an immense
crop.
  The tortoise is still fsirly
active.
  The artichokes are 7 ft
high but show no sign of
flowering.
  There is no evidence of 
frost.
October 30.
  A considerable proportion 
of the Hayley Wood acorns -
stored in a half-tub out of
doors - are germinating.  The
style-remains split and the
radicle emerges and turns
downside.
October 31
2689
100 Hayley acorns which
had germinated were potted
in Jophn Innes in plastic pots,
by Wm Palmer.
November 1
Hayley Wood (Historical Ecology
Group).
  2 young oaks were found
by Donald Pigott at the S.
end of the Triangle.
  The party was taken along
"Hayley Ditch" into the glade
and out by the coppice plots.

Hardwick Wood (H.E.G.)
  The party was taken  in at
the S.W., corner, through the
R.& F. areas on the W. side,
back down the E. side, and
[12690-12691]
2690
out at the S.E. corner.
  Mercury is now very largely
dead.

Buff Wood (H.E.G.)
  The party was taken through
East Hatley.  Many members
were surprised and amused
by the street of [????moats] in
East Hatley.
  We entered the wood by 
the S.E. gate and went as
far as the old wood.
2691
November 2.
Hayley Wood (coppicing).
  Over half the coppice was 
completed today.
  A large bonfire lit under
a sizeable oak near the S.
corner of the plot caused much
trouble.  A mouldering snag
some 20 ft high started smoul-
dering.  The fire was allowed
to die down but it continued
to burn and was fanned by
the wind into flame.  Another
dead branch also started to
burn.  The fire was put
out with great difficulty by 
bringing water from the pond
and heaping earth on it, but
one of the snags continued to

[12692-12693]
2692
burn indefinitely until scraped
with a pole.
The combustion evidently
began with quite a modest rise
in temperature, the fire not being 
fierce and flames never reach-
ing anything like the height of
the snags.  The material
burning was the rotten sap-wood
at the base of dead branches
adjoining the living sap-wood
of the main branch.
There was no evidence
of damage to the teee or
threat of a larger conflagration.
2693
November 8.
  Felsham Hall Wood (S.M. Walters,
J. Dickson, W.H. Palmer. Father Lothian,
John Hedger, Joan Dunkley, Dr Watt
and students, total 23).

d. Cirriphyllum piliferium.  Bases
of stools (J. Dickson).

  The elm coppice in FHW is
apparently a hybrid U. procera
x glabra;  none definitely with 
3 tips;  no suckers.
  Phragmites on the cottage
site has about 6 infls.
  The Calamagrostis near the 
cottage site and westwards along
the main ride appears to be


[12694-12695]
2694
all canescens (SMW).  It forms
dense stands which have now
lodged except where trapped
in young trees.
  In the two bracken glades
in the middle of FHW, the bracken
has all died and collapsed 
except where caught up in 
trees.  Two fronds so caught
and still green measured 12'01/2"
and 12'81/2" long.
  There are several hummocks
and hollows in the S. of these 
glades.
  To the W. of the N. of the 
glades, there are two free-stan-
ding bushes of Frangula, each
about 8ft high, rounded in
outline.  Branches with bark
[Dr Watt said he had never seen
any so large.
2695
with short longitudinal fissures.
Frangula was seen in several
other places.
  The "fish pond" is quite dry
and contains much Lycopus in
the bottom.
  By the "fish pond" were
seen two stumps about 1ft
dia. apparently of Pinus syl-
vestris, though too decayed
for certain identification.  They
had apparently had big low
branches.  A trunk was found
mouldering in the bottom of
the "pond".
  Lysimachia nummularia
was found in the bottom of
the "pond" to the FHW side (SMW).
Succisa still flowers in

[12696-12697]
2696
the S. side.
  A single small plant of
ivy, about 1 1/2 ft long, was found
by the 359o ditch in the
middle S.E. compartment of FHW.
  This ditch is about 1 1/2 ft
deep, the upcast changing
from side to side.  It appears
to be similar to that in the
E. compartment, and probably
for drainage.
  Numerous acorns are 
still about.
  The main ride is still
fairly soft.
  Most of the Prunus in
the wood is reasonably homo-
geneous, but a bush resembling 
cerasifera (green, glabrous, shiny
2697
twigs, gray in the 2nd year)
and one resembling insititia
(thorny, twigs densely pubes-
cent, by now brown) were found.
P. spinosa by now has brown
or gray twigs.
  Several elder bushes by the
ditches of the E. part of Main
Ride havde died, apparently thro'
flooding.
  Silaum silaus is common
on the S. ride.
Ribes rubrum occurs by
the 259o ditch.
  A large crab tree was seen 
on the S. boundary.
  Vicia tetrasperma:  small qty
on main ride.

bout 60 more acorns from
Hayley which had begun germinating
were potted up (tar-paper pots,
John Innes no. 1) making a total
of about 160.
November 15.
2699
     Pigeons are
     very numer-
     ous in Ely 
     Cathedral
     and several
     dead birds
     were found
     in the Octa-
     gon.
       The gourds
     continue to 
     flourish, but 
 only very small fruit have been
 produced.
 November 16.
 Hayley Wood (coppicing & poind
 making.
 Coppicing was almost finished
 today.
 
 [12700-12701]
 2700
   The bottom of "Hayley Ditch
 Ride" being largely dry, work con-
 tinued on excavating the new pond.
 The dam was formed from
 the material dug out from
 an area about 0 - 8 ft above, in 
 section thus:
 
   [DIAG]
   
  The bottom of the 
ditch contained about
2 in of leaf mould.  Below
this was some 9 in. of apparently
in situ clay, under which ex-
cavation was stopped by a 
gravel pavement.
2701
November 17.
  No gourds of any size 
have been produced.
  The Passiflora has not
flowered this year.
November 22.
Hockering Wood.
