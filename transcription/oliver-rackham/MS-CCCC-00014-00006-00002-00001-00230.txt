LAVENDER COTTAGE
14 AUGUST 1976
GREAT WALDINGFIELD
Blackberries are uneffected
by drought – an excellent year
for them in the Waldingfield
garden.
Onions have done very
well – yield estimated at 220 lb
from plot 40 x 12 ft.
The old broom bushes are
declining more rapidly.
Fennel unaffected by 
drought.
Viburnum opulus is much
wilted.
15 August.
Hedgehog seen late at night
opposite Crusoe's Island.
Grass is now about as dry

[17866-17867]

as in early July.
Lime trees appear largely
unaffected by drought. The
stump of the great lime at Waldingfield has sent up
many shoots, most of which are unaffected, but the tallest has markedly brown and stunted
leaves.
But see Boringdon-Pa[????]chall
book & photographs.

16 August.
DED.
Toft 8%
Caldecote 8% (lower)
B[????] (by road) 4%, scattered;
difficult to estimate because

years) – none of the big free-
-standing elms is attacked. .

The east-west avenue at
Wimpole has a few trees of
the same reticulate-barked elm
clone as those in the south
avenue. Most of the trees are
replacements: the earlier ones p-
-type elm, the later ones oaks
[????]c. The oaks have grown low &
spreading and greatly alter the
appearance of the avenue.
There is another avenue
leading to the ornamental
bridge at the S.W. corner of
Cobb's Wood. This is of Hunting-
don-like elms, most of which have collapsed violently some
decades ago.

Stow Bed[????] Me[????].
Much overgrown, at least at

WAYLAND WOOD - including DED.
Numerous big pollard oaks
[!!!!]ound Wayland Wood and in
nearby parts of Griston, Merton, and
Thompson.
Merton Park. Typical 18th cent.
park with br[????]nd[????] belts, mostly
of youngish trees, isolated trees
and clumps. [!!!!]Several clumps
are of elm and have suffered
from severe DED. There are
a few ancient oaks, evidently
from before the park scattered
among much younger trees.
The southern woods, most [!!!!]of[!!!!]
Sparrow Hill, have just [!!!!]been[!!!!]
felled for replanting.

[17874-17875]

Thompson Common. Much [!!!!]grown

full of pingo - like hollows.
Little or no straw-burning
in this part of Norfolk, which is
low-farming country with a lot of rough grass.
The Breckland is not con-
spicuously drier than other
parts of East Anglia.
