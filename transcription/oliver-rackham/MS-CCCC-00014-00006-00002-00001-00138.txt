May 25.
A flowering Anthriscus plant
dug up a few days ago has
been successfully transplanted
without any wilting or check
to growth or flowering.
May 26.
There is a [DIAG]
blue-tit's nest
outside my rooms
in Fanshawe House
in the cavity of
a cast-iron lamp-standard.
This is of the usual late-
-Victorian type with a hole
in the top, which acts as the
entrance. Although facing up-
wards, it is protected from
rain by the lantern above.
The birds enter by the space
[10434-10435]
434
between the lantern and the
top of the standard. Visits
(probably to the young) are
by one bird only, at inter-
vals averaging about a minute,
though on one occasion there
were three visits within a
minute.
A terrapin was observed
motionless (apart from fre-
quently changing the position
of its head) on a rock about
1ft out of the water at the
Gardens. It did not move when
approached to within c. 3ft. It
stayed there for at least 1/2 hour.
The head has an acute "prow"
and the back legs sharp claws.
The shell is very low and
very muddy. Slightly bigger
435
than N[????]ckey.
Cypripedium is flowering
very well this year.
May 27.
The cold spell for the last
3 weeks or so appears to be
ending. Bluebells and horse-
-chestnuts have remained in
flower for an unusually long
time.
The Passifloras of market
origin are just starting growth
but that from Notcutts is still
delayed.
May 28.
The first Saponaire ocymoides
flowers opened.
May 29.
[!!!!] Ipornaea began germinating.
May 30.
22 ornamental gourd and 13 Cobaea
scandens seeds were sown in tubs.
[10436-10437]

May 31.
Sauromatum
guttatum (Bot.Gard.).
see p.442.
[DIAG]
Knapwell Wood
Stellaria holostea near entrance
Festuca gigantea Occasional.
Atrichum undul. frequent.
Malus. One tree of the culti-
vated ssp was seen on the S.W.
437
edge of the wood. The wild
ssp is frequent in the S.W.
section.
The cuckoo was heard in
this wood.
Bluebells are now nearly
over.
Stellaria holostea occurs
in two places in rather small
quantity: see map.
One bluebell plant was
found in which each flower is
subtended by a linear-lanceolate
acute bract about 1in. long.
Around the W. end of the
main ride is a large popula-
tion of Heracleum sphondylium
in which both varieties are repre-
sented. Elsewhere in the wood
only the broad-leaved occurs.
[10438-10439]
438
[DIAG]
Mercury [????] is local.
439
[DIAG]
St.h=Stellaria holostea.
Orchis mascula very local
and infrequent.
[10440-10441]

The wood is about as
wet as Hayley would be.
Little standing water.
One coppice oak near the
middle of the wood has
split asunder and two trunks
fallen away from the other four.
The whole wood has dense
and almost continuous herb-
aceous undergrowth, probably
because the small coppice is
absent.
Ash canker is frequent.
The buildings of the ad-
joining farm are largely
modern and made of impor-
ted timber. Some are of
roughly dquared ash and
other poles, some with bark
on; this probably represents
441
large coppice. Most of the
smaller poles in these rougher
buildings are of conifers (?
pine) roughly squared; this
may represent the conifers shown
on the O.S. map.
A large erratic about
4ft high and weighing perhaps
a ton was found in the
darm, where it had been used
as a mounting block, and has
now been set up as a stan-
ding stone in front of the farm.
It is an irregular lump of
hard ferruginous concretyions
and a variety of shells and
other fossils. One side is
very glaciated. Various smaller
boulders exist about the
[10442-10443]
442
farm.
The E. end of the wood
contains old machinery and
other junk, including a pile
of mercurated seed-corn
which is now smouldering.
The edge of the wood
is everywhere very bushy.
There has been some en-
croachment on the S. and S.W.
sides, but probably not due
to elm.
Botanical Gardens (see p. 436).
Sauromatum guttatum is
an outdoor aroid. The spadix
is about 6in. high. Spathe
partly in the ground. Infl.
pale green with large closely
spaced plain-chocolate-brown spots.
443
A fine s[????]nt of jugged hare.
A terrapin was seen in
exactly the same place as
before (p.434). Another jumped
into the water when disturbed
and paddled vigorously around,
frequently coming to the surface.
There is a remarkable
fasciation of a scapose Prim-
ula. It is a complete regular
cylinder with flowers from the
top edge. The outside of the
cylinder is smooth and naked
like the ordinary s[????]ape. There
are several leaves inside, but
it was not possible to see
where they were attached. On
the sandstone rocks above the
lake.
Othonnopsis cheirifolia (L.)
[10444-10445]
444
Benth. & Hook. is a dwarf
shrubbery composite with thick-
ish [????]y glaucous spathulate
leaves. These are held erect
and closely spaced. Those on
any one creeping shoot are
in parallel planes. The plant
as a whole is a compass
plant, the greatest leaf area
being exposed to the S.W. and
N.E., though there is consi-
derable variation in individual
shoots about this mean.
There are many ducklings
on the lake which squabble
over pieces of bread.
The sequoia sempervirens is
now very brown.
445
June 1.
Many Ipomaea seedlings
and a few Tropaeolum have
emerged.
The Sempervivum ti[????]olie[????]-
sis x styriacum is going to
flower.
Eccremocarpos is flower-
ing.
Of the Gentiane asclepi-
adea, only two small shoots
are evident.
The Cotyledon umbilicus
(Lizard) is going to flower.
