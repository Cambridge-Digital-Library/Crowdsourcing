8 June.
Pollen is flying in clouds
from the Pinus ? laricio trees on
the Leckchampton - Pinehurst
boundary.
Elms.
Two in Ridley-Hall Road,
both Up. One healthy but 
fruiting in vast abundance,
perhaps more than any other in
Cambridge. Leaves very few save
on vigorously-growing long-shoots
on outer crown of tree. The
other about 1/3 affected by DED,
fruiting copiously (but in less ex-
treme abundance).
Up in Brookside, opp. Leys 
School. Affected by drought and
DED for several years, now 
c. 2/3 dead; remaining crown

fruiting extremely heavily. Leaves
in outermost epicormics of trunk,
which are growing vigorously.
Two great Up in West Road.
One dead, the other very severe,
little fruit. This one shows the
first (recurrence) symptoms of
DED in Cambridge.

9 June.
Black Poplars. Rectory Paddock
(Grassy Corder). Fen Ditton.

Tree 1 (northern). Girth (GBH)

Was treated by arborists last

c. 15" dia., particularly pendu-
lous high ones, were cut off.
Larger cuts treated with ?Arbrex
but some of c. 6" dia. un-
treated. Branches removed were
not or slightly rotten; operation prob. unneces0
sary. Two branches had c. 155
and c. 190 growth rings; age
cf tree prob. 200 y. Bark
ridges triangular in section, with
what appear to be annual
rings of bark.

Tree 2. GBH = (6 chains + 2 keys),
(6 ch. + 1 key) = 209.6, 207.4,
mean 208 1/2 in. A few branches
