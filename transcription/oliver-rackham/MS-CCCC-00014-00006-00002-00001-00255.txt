1979

8 June.
Pollen is flying in clouds
from the Pinus ? laricio trees on
the Leckchampton - Pinehurst
boundary.
Elms.
Two in Ridley-Hall Road,
both Up. One healthy but 
fruiting in vast abundance,
perhaps more than any other in
Cambridge. Leaves very few save
on vigorously-growing long-shoots
on outer crown of tree. The
other about 1/3 affected by DED,
fruiting copiously (but in less ex-
treme abundance).
Up in Brookside, opp. Leys 
School. Affected by drought and
DED for several years, now 
c. 2/3 dead; remaining crown

[19678-19679]

fruiting extremely heavily. Leaves
in outermost epicormics of trunk,
which are growing vigorously.
Two great Up in West Road.
One dead, the other very severe,
little fruit. This one shows the
first (recurrence) symptoms of
DED in Cambridge.

9 June.
Black Poplars. Rectory Paddock
(Grassy Corder). Fen Ditton.

Tree 1 (northern). Girth (GBH)
= (7 chains - 2 envelopes + 1/2 in.),
(7 chains - 2 envelopes)
= 225.9, 229.4, mean 228 in.
Was treated by arborists last
winter: several branches up to

9679

c. 15" dia., particularly pendu-
lous high ones, were cut off.
Larger cuts treated with ?Arbrex
but some of c. 6" dia. un-
treated. Branches removed were
not or slightly rotten; operation prob. unneces0
sary. Two branches had c. 155
and c. 190 growth rings; age
cf tree prob. 200 y. Bark
ridges triangular in section, with
what appear to be annual
rings of bark.

Tree 2. GBH = (6 chains + 2 keys),
(6 ch. + 1 key) = 209.6, 207.4,
mean 208 1/2 in. A few branches
up to 6" dia. removed. This 
tree is very extensively leaf-
galled. Galls consist of a 
pale-yellow spindle-shaped

thickening of the lower mid[????]
and upper petiole. Almost
all the leaves in the lower
part of the S. side of the free
are affected; the attack is cu-
riously localized to this part
of this tree. Pemphigus filaginis
is the most likely agent.

Three new trees c. 6ft. high
have been planted; labelled
"Populus migra RWH 258-75 W
Cambridge"

Elms. Those in Ditton Fields
are c. 15 large Up and c. 15
large [!!!!]Uhh[!!!!] Huntingdon UpL 2/3 dead, remainder severe [!!!!]to
dead[!!!!] with disease, no unusual
fruiting. Huntingdon: about
1/2 dead. Up & Uc suckers in hedges

9681

up to c. 15 ft high are almost
free of disease.

10 June
Elms. Up in St John's grounds
near Westminster College:
[!!!!]made[!!!!] abundant but not ex-
cessive fruit.
Surviving Up in Madingley
Road, S. side, W. of entrance of 
Grange Road: abundant but 
hardly excessive fruit, foliage
little less than normal, fruit
more dense in S. side.
Uh in Grange RoadL abund-
ant but not excessive fruit,
foliage normal.
Most elm fruit is still on
the trees.

11 June.
Elms.
Childerley Gate (mainly Box-
worth-type): 40% dead.
Bourn - Boxworth - Knapwell
borders : 10%
Knapwell Wood Farm and en-
virons: almost nil.
Excessive fruiting of Boxworth
-type elms in Knapwell and 
Overhall Grove, quite as much
as of Up in Cambridge. All
the ancient elms of Knapwell
are so fruiting save for two 
of a different genotype by
Thoro'fare Lane. Other elms
fruiting little more than usual.

KNAPWELL WOOD.
OVERHALL GROVE.
